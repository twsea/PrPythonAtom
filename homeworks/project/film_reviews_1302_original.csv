Toy Story (1995)	"as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters. the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system....

Jumanji (1995)	"being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment! and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10 original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. "	6.9	0
Grumpier Old Men (1995)	"a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. legend is returned to it's base.Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says ""Holy moly"" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age.

Waiting to Exhale (1995)	"unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't ""tell this story"" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were.Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! "	5.8	0
Father of the Bride Part II (1995)	I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism. to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written.If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair.Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains.On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. 	6.0	0
Heat (1995)	want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur. who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry. makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made. movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.A real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time. and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass. 	8.2	1
Sabrina (1995)	"the) Moonlight"" and ""How Can I Remember?"", are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies, and I think ""Sabrina"" ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous, marvelous film! version of ""Sabrina"", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn ""Sabrina"".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role. great acting can define a relationship, this one between mother and son, for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford's tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack's mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman.""It was a lie, then it was a dream."" who wears the business-first character of the ""only surviving heart donor"" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!) the players are selected very well , each contributing mightily to the final effect! The director really knew what he was doing and keeps the movie going strong.. congratulations to all. I wish there were more works like this, and would really like to see another done with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in the title roles, oncemore!. Bravo! Bravo! "	6.3	0
Tom and Huck (1995)	scenes. The graveyard scene is well done. Injun Joe is threatening and murderous. The funeral scene is a disappointment. It needed to be milked a bit. Some of the peripheral characters could have been more developed. The conclusion works OK. However, it needed a dose of truth and believability to carry it through. See it, but don't expect a lot. Huck is an interesting enough film, but the transformation of Eric Schweig in his portrayal of Injun Joe compared to his characterization of Uncas in The Last of the Mohicans, is the most fascinating thing about it. In the body of his films, he seems to be able to alternate between utterly noble and utterly disgusting (e.g., Missing). Great acting. sugar-coated scenes and the fact that both Tom and Huck are a bit out-of-character, this movie is still something worth seeing. Injun Joe and Muff Potter are both realistic and Rachael Leigh Cook makes a brilliant and not-so-girly Becky Thatcher! The sets and wardrobe look very authentic, but they alone are not enough to bring the evergreen story wholly alive. of all time? Not that this is a bad film. As far as kid stories go, it is alright, and not the worst introduction to the world of Mark Twain. But it is clearly not intended to be a masterpiece, but more like something one might see on the Hallmark channel. Just a showcase for the now-forgotten Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Not to mention that Rachael Leigh Cook as Becky Thatcher is probably the worst case of miscasting in this movie; she was way too old and was a good two heads taller than Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Disney could have made their own version of Tom Sawyer great, especially with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the lead. What a wasted, missed opportunity. 	5.6	0
Sudden Death (1995)	"the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. ""Sudden Death"" has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won't care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn't. I'll never understand why.***1/2 (out of four) through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn't it?The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I'm undecided if ""Sudden Death"" would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer's ""Black Sunday"".  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It's a straight crime story.One note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version. Boothe. He was extremely convincing as ""the bad guy"". The movie at times is a little far fetched..but most movies are.  I also thought it was very cool how Jean-Claude's character used lots of odd objects to create weapons(Fire extinguisher, tube and darts)..anyway if your looking for a good action movie to watch, Sudden Death should be your choice. be one of the best movies of all time in it's genre. This movie - Sudden Death - is his best action film.Great action scenes, some very hilarious scenes, and great overall action and suspense make this a great action movie overall.If you like action movies, you'll love this one. If you are a Van-Damme fan, this is a must-see.9/10 "	5.7	0
GoldenEye (1995)	"produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it. as an extra at the Chemin De Fer table at Monte Carlo's gambling casino; she's the daughter of Eunice Gayson, who played Bond's fetching girlfriend, Sylvia Trench in the first two Bond films, ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love."" It was to Sylvia Trench that Sean Connery uttered his first line of dialog, ""I admire your luck, Mr. ...?"" briefing and some commands.  Brosnan more than holds his own against past Bonds, and offers some of that GQ gentlemen element found missing in some of the past ones.  Bond fan, action fan, any fan, check this one out.  I even made my girlfriend watch it, and even she enjoyed it.  Chances are you will too. in my opinion, and ties all the classic 007 elements together flawlessly. Although adhering to the Bond foundations, this film has a great, fresh feel to it, I think partly due to the industrial style score by Eric Serra. I think you need to see this film more than once to fully appreciate it, but it is definitely a classic! has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs (what a way to go!) Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun. "	7.2	0
American President, The (1995)	"look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own. I enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most ""romantic"" settings in the world - The White House. makes you jealous as always, J. Fox never misses an opportunity to display huge talent and Dreyfuss is just the kind of guy you love to hate. Add a dose of victorious political correctness and top it of with a final speech that raises the hair on any kinds of neck but rednecks, and you got your evening made.Enjoy ! interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting. particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country's Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally, I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I'm not even American! Whatever the nation involved, pity we don't have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today. to none.  Just fabulous. "	6.8	0
Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)	"engaged couple who after 10 years have suddenly held hands being condemned as immoral, prostitutes, lechers and the like. Into these cultural and successful observations Brook's introduces Leslie Nielson doing a great impression of Bela Lugosi's Dracula with the difference that his powers are incompetent.Seeing the Lugosi movie will give you the basis to appreciate the sophistication of this film. ""Oh.  Give him an enima.""As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.FOOSH-TAA!""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" gets 9 of 10 stars Leslie Neilson did a great job in the role of Dracula, and his Renfield, Peter MacNichol, was a superb performance.This movie deserves full credit for its level of parodistic comedy, even if it is lost on viewers.  If you can't stand this movie, or find it unentertaining, then maybe you don't understand its roots well enough to appreciate it. story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for ""Love At First Bite"" which was similar in laughs to this.

Balto (1995)	"of the movie. It especially sounds great when you're supporting surround sound.This movie was a great movie and people think it was one of the greatest letdowns in the 1990's. In my opinion, it was the greatest animated movie and I would recommend that you should watch it with your family or with a friend. It is a fantastic movie... to do. You will enjoy this film greatly. After viewing it once, you will want to see it again. I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. But it has been more than thirty times. See this movie. It's well worth seeing. This one is one that I am proud to have in my video collection.....5/5. of the Balto statue in Central Park) which acts as a tie-together, and the true story behind this movie gives it additional appeal. This film, like the WB's 'Iron Giant', has been breezed over by the public and not gotten the recognition it deserves. I would recommend Balto for anyone who likes dogs, realism, or just a smooth, enjoyable film. DVD! This movie teaches a wonderful lesson. And is just a wonderful true movie!If you can get this movie for your children. They will enjoy it for years to come, as will you!And i really don't need 10 lines to explain to you how good this movie is. When you get the chance to watch it, that will be enough. that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look.  It's actually one of the best underrated animated films of the 90's.  The drama is real, the visuals are beautiful, and the story ends happily.  The live action prologue and epilogue are a little distracting, but they're made up for by a random (and hilarious) visual shout-out to ""E.T."" "	7.1	0
Nixon (1995)	"ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone, so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone's film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward arms-extended, double V-sign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion. in '64?""A truly fascinating portrayal of a fascinating man, even in the end somewhat sympathetic to Nixon as the film ends with his 1994 funeral service, some comments at that service by President Clinton and a summary of his career by a narrator pointing out his accomplishments. A last note: kudos to Paul Sorvino, who hit Henry Kissinger bang on.8/10 first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story. on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well? Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon. "	7.1	0
Cutthroat Island (1995)	"just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects. In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean (which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods). a good story. The successful franchize ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an improvement of ""Cutthroat Island"" with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Ilha da Garganta Cortada"" (""The Cutthroat Island"") who played Elizabeth Swann in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - and to have Geena walloping Keira's waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank ""Dracula/Skeletor"" Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else, rent it for the expensive sets, fancy costumes, and elaborate, over the top stunts - many of which Davis and Modine did themselves. Shaw (Matthew Modine). If you enjoy Seventeenth Century pirate movies, and like to see how 92 million dollars were spent in sea-battles, rope-swinging, slow motion swashbuckling action, cannons with many explosions and many fires, plenty of rum, cove and cliffs, lots of treasure, the destruction of two Jamaican towns, gorgeous ocean vistas and breathtaking visuals ... don't miss this one! Davis is rather engaging as a female pirate and Frank Langella seemed to be enjoying himself.  Most people will say that this movie can't hold a candle to the pirate films of Errol Flynn, and they're right.  But for a rock em sock em pirate adventure with more explosions than the high seas ever saw, watch Cutthroat Island. "	5.6	0
Casino (1995)	"gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come. Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem. clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening... They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story... 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy... And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic... have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences). check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly "	8.2	1
Sense and Sensibility (1995)	"the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it's bumped 'Raging Bull' off my personal top 10 list. Lee's direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson's script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma. All in all, this is excellent. but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film, for the story, the wit, the period and the imagery. opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making. I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish.

Four Rooms (1995)	"entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day, it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet. especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize's misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won't regret seeing it. types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation. his visual storytelling.  It's low-rent Tarantino, don't get me wrong, but it's also the best part of ""Four Rooms.""All in all, the first film I've ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just don't make me watch it again. Soup, all from the 92 Sundance place), they did whatever they wanted, and it's not the success it could've been.

His work is done.When this ""Nature"" calls, answer it.Nine stars.  And remember: do not pass go, do not collect $200. that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it's Ace's love for animals that comes out quite well.

Money Train (1995)	remarkable when it first came out, but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly entertaining and well executed. Granted, it's not the best film ever but I don't think it's deserving of a lot of the bad reviews given here.As a film it succeeds, and if you've never seen it before, it's worth checking out. she is in real life. I really don't know where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You might like it but not because it's quality stuff but because it'll cheer you up, it's so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I'll give it a full **** out of *****. role in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist.Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of its parts, and that's possibly the most frustrating thing of all. I don't want to be fussy and pick out several little pieces and analyse them , this film was a simple time killing pop-corn movie that should viewed when you don't feel like watching something heavy or you'd rather check this out rather than Santa's Slay . MONEY TRAIN - 5.6 OUT 10 - THATS WHAT WE LIVE WITH . provides a real antagonism for the buddy/brother cops, and establishes himself as the real villain for the plot.The plan, and the execution of the robbery, (and Snipes character going along with something like this), REALLY stretches plausibility, but there is an easy camaraderie between the 2 actors, and the action is good.It ain't all that good, but it isn't unwatchable. 	5.6	0
Get Shorty (1995)	"ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A- its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood's unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there's plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, ""Be Cool"", wasn't quite as good, but still worth seeing. is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn't already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time. If I had enjoyed the film the first time, looking at it a second time was a revelation. the movie business. Before he can however, he must deal with bumbling mobsters, white-collar criminals, and the anxiety of trying to find the right leading man. Crackling, hilarious dialogue, well-drawn characters, and clever insight into the movie business run rampant in this snappy little comedy. Maybe not for all tastes, but well-made and a definite must for Travolta fans. *** especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (from 'The Addams Family'), knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it. Fortunately we have the actors and direction to make it even better and definitely more entertaining. "	6.9	0
Copycat (1995)	"deserve credit for a intelligent, well-researched screenplay. No clichés here, just sharply-crafted dialogue. And Christopher Young's inspired score is brilliant; just listen to the theme that plays early on, as Helen calms down after a panic attack.""Copyat"" may not be classic material, but it's a strong entry in a genre that's too often consumed by formulas and gore. Highly recommended. too soon and could be kept as a mystery; but anyway the character is not connected to Helen, Andy, M.J. or Reuben and it would not be possible to have a twist or a major surprise if the mystery was kept. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Copycat - A Vida Imita a Morte"" (""Copycat – The Life Imitates The Death"") with a serial killer. Offers a clif's notes review of the century's major serial killers, constant tension, crisp writing and outstanding performances.  In short, it is a very good, very scary movie, and you should see it it you haven't yet.   Personally, I also think Weaver looks fabulous.  Brains and beauty and character.  Nice combination. is very clever in its own right. It is undoubtedly influenced (heavily) by ""Silence of the Lambs"" but is successful in the way it adds its own qualities to the mix -- much like ""Se7en"" this is a serial killer movie cashing in on the success of ""Silence,"" but not necessarily stealing its content.Very surprised. Catch it if you can. Mulroney providing Hunter with the dashing detective sidekick Ruben Goetz. The viewer is drawn to start thinking along the same lines as the lead characters and twists in the plot ensure that you don't get it all right ahead of the storyline.Highly recommended for a night in.

Assassins (1995)	"out the movie is written by the same people who did the Matrix and I can see how that is so. Any movie with Banderas is usually good, and this is no exception. :) If anyone likes sniper movies like Enemy at the Gates or Leon the Professional, this is definitely a movie worth checking out. You won't regret it. Moore's eyes.  You can see the difference so easily.  Banderas is alive, which is good.  The best performance is probably from Julianne Moore who is the girl they have to get the disk from.  Special effects are good, as is the ending climax.  Overall, it is thrilling, with a fair amount of action and violence. the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, ""Assassins"" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously.Like ""Daylight"" and ""Copland"", ""Assassins"" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again. When I first watched this film, I had no idea it featured the would be superstar Antonio Banderas, nor that it was written by the soon to be Matrix creators.  In that sense it is almost a fun movie to watch because it kinda answers the question ""what did they do before they were famous?"" and now you know. so. From then on, it's battle between the two.The movie is quite similar to ""The Specialist""(1994) - another Sylvester Stallone movie - only that there he had no Banderas to fight against!A couple of words on the cast. Well, I already said that Stallone and Banderas did well but my compliments go to Julianne Moore. She was brilliant.Vote : 80/100. "	6.3	0
Powder (1995)	"humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time. a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery. so Sean does have pretty eyes, but, come on!On a side note, for those of you who think that the Deputy Sheriff's character was a ""stereotypical"" cop character, giving the police a bad name...I have relatives who are police in a small town like this one, and you should hear THEM talk over the dinner table. It ISN'T much different. The movie is trying so hard to be profound that it doesn't ring anywhere close to true. People are too stupid. People are too mean-spirited. The melodrama is too high. The actors sound fake. Powder is basically either going to be a superhero or supervillain. This could be a great comic book origin movie but every character is slightly wrong. do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind.

Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film. shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects. behind me!The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives have become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites. genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of ***** his heart. She sees him for what he is, because that's what responsible angels do.This is a work with metaphor far beyond the veneer of the surface dialog. It's a film demanding to be viewed more than once.

See this film. undoubtedly find favour with viewers more inclined towards modern tastes. It has high production values, a sweeping score, accessible delivery of the lines, flashy photography, and ""cool"" stylistic touches (Fishburne's head tattoo, for instance). Personally, I feel the 1952 Othello will always be the benchmark, but this one is reasonably well made and it compares quite favourably with other versions. chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacob's Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Do watch it. Fishburne however did a magnificent job!  He provided us an astonishing portrayal of how even a noble, righteous and even intelligent man, can succumb to ""the green eyed monster.""  The calculatingly evil Iago was FLAWLESSLY portrayed by veteran Shakespearian actor Kenneth Branagh, who occasionally stared into the eyes of the camera itself, explaining his dark plans and expectations. with Kenneth Brannagh's ""Hamlet"", the longest and most tedious of his self-advertisements, in which every long-winded speech was preserved intact. Here Brannagh's Iago is almost as good as Fishbourne's Othello, and he makes the most of the lines he has.To sum up, ten out of ten.

The story is just so great, i could watch the movie all over again.It makes you think that real friends do exist. I would give Now And Then 10/10 that has a likeable cast and is funny and expresses friendship. Yes, it is definetley a girl's movie, but even though, I enjoyed it. The movie is like Stand By Me, except it shows girls's perspectives. The film is a good and fun movie to watch for fun. I give Now and Then a 9 out of 10.  :) 'Gold Diggers' co-star, Ashleigh Aston Moore - as the mis-informed Chrissy. Bonnie Hunt ('Jumangi') and Devon Sawa ('Wild America') also star.The story is great - plenty of laughs to be had here, with sad moments, too.

Persuasion (1995)	"performances by Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister), Phoebe Nicholls (remember ""Brideshead Revisited""?), and Corin Redgrave is enough to make this movie recommendable, but the 2 main characters are absolutely superb and sympathetic without being sappy or gratuitous. The other supporting cast is phenomenal; what one expects from a nice little English film. Cinematography and soundtrack are fitting as well. Highly recommended! characters act within the conventions of regency England and seem to be comfortable doing so.I would recommend this movie to any Jane Austen lover or a person who enjoys period films or classic literature.  A person who does not fall into those categories might enjoy it as well, but is likely to find it slow and difficult to understand. Anne with their uselessness. Phoebe Nicholls, of Brideshead Revisted fame (she was Sebastian Flyte's youngest sister Cordelia) contributes yet another wonderful performance in her career, as the ill-tempered Elizabeth, ultimately conveying the tragedy of the burgeoning spinster in the last scene.Even if great literary classics aren't your ""bag"" don't miss this minor masterpiece if you happen to love great film-making. California has said, `I guess to make it a little more seductive to us over here'.  Nonetheless, it is pleasing to read that this film was well received in the States especially as it remained true to its British identity, and therefore set an exemplary standard in not pandering to an anticipated overseas market by using well-known international stars. life.

You can be the weakest person on earth but if your truly a good actor then you can make anyone believe your a tough guy or girl. The music was awesome.  The cast was great.

12 Monkeys (Twelve Monkeys) (1995)	"Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10 is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades. a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10 scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss! dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties. "	8.0	1

I often suggested this for viewing to classes of young people and adults needing an understanding of the real costs of success.Incredible scenery and every time I see an ant, I remember the endurance of that man and others like him who purchased our progress and freedoms by perseverance. it is the first drama IMAX film. The cast is just perfect and the plot will get you hooked. Now you can see it in your own home (it is now on video)! So if you can find it rent it tonight or if you have it playing at the local IMAX theater near you see it there.Grade Average: A while the public applauds men of lesser virtue (such as the pilot played by Val Kilmer). And it was nice to see Tom Hulce portray one of my own personal heroes - 'Saint-Ex'!This is one of the better films of true survival against near-impossible odds. The participants of those 'Survivor' shows should give this movie a viewing or two... really! 70mm films are shown on 35mm screens with apparent higher resolution when projected.  So this movie I would say is a diamond in the rough of IMAX/3D films: slickly produced, great sound, picture, cinematography, acting, and script, as well as beautiful breathtaking scenery of the Swiss Alps.

The acting is superb, the animatronics are unrecognizable as such, and James Cromwell is superb as the taciturn farmer willing to give the little pig a chance. But Babe has an awful lot of ambition for a little animal, and his heart is set on being a ""sheep-pig"".There are moments of sadness in this film, such as loss and death, but it is mainly sweet natured and enchanting. It is one of the few Universal rated films I enjoy watching, and that is saying something for me! call it a childrens film. It is simply a great film. A film that shows how wondrous things can happen as a result of common decency; how any individual can triumph if they believe in themselves; how vital is the help of family and friends in life's arduous journey.This a film not to be missed. It should have beaten Braveheart. or government officials. Here, he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings.

This is a film not to be missed. privy to so many more truths and realizations than you'll see in any other standard film about a romance. What we have here is a paradox: an old-fashioned story about an avant-garde arrangement.

In our society the love of ""one and only"" can be an oppressive ideal that few can attain, and Hollywood is its loudest proponent.  This movie allows for a well thought out exploration on of the many other faces of true love.  Superb acting, direction, editing, costuming, the works.  I highly recommend it. illustration. Combine this refreshing glimpse of consensual mores with outstanding interpretations by Thompson and Pryce, and with fidelity to historical fact, and you've got two delightful hours of first-rate cinema on your hands. And not an exploding car or a vengeance-driven, gadget-laden military operation against a demonized third-world country anywhere to be found. Amazing. And bravo. 9 out of 10. good actors but I believe its success is largely due to director Christopher Hampton's screenplay. It's a full two hour movie without the benefit of car chases, explosions or kickboxing matches, so it's a big plus to have something nice to look at for all that time.

If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. But whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There's not one false note in the film. more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.  The spirit and compassion of the book is dead-on accurate.  It amazes me that Robbins' screenplay adaptation was not even nominated for an Oscar in addition to the other four nominations this movie did receive.  As far as I am concerned, Robbins' direction and writing are assured, and I continue to look forward to his next projects. "	7.5	1

It Takes Two (1995)	seen. I love the way that they have one rich twin and one poor twin. the best part of the movie is when they are running through the woods screaming and the song hippie, hippie shake is playing. This is the best movie out of the olsen twins collection and i would recommend you see it giving it a 10/10. bump into eachother, they swap families in hopes of joining Roger with Diane (the Emmy award-winning Kirstie Alley).Mary Kate and Ashley are as cute as ever, Steve is fine (and really, that's all he is), Kirstie is great as Diane, but Jane is the best as the snotty Clarice.A great little comedy - and a must for Olsen twins fans. the first minutes. I couldn't stop watching this movie until the final credits rolled. Having raised two girls I was particularly tuned into the Olsen girls. I was blown away by how cute and funny and bright they were. And I thought the love story though predictable was tastefully handled and fairly intelligent. All in all a most enjoyable experience. for that to fail, instead they try to lead the orphan camp leader, Diane Barrows and Alyssas father together, if that will succeed you're just going to have to watch the movie.I think it was a really good movie made by the Olsen twins, amazing how good they can though they are so young.I give it *** of ***** stars to them for help and advice. I thought this movie was made with a beautiful plot, truly great acting, very nice camera work, and, very importantly, very good character development: enough time is taken to introduce every important character's life before getting anywhere near the main idea of the movie. I would, personally, give this movie a 10/10, hands down. 	5.8	0

In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10 of the picture who's only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It's worth renting anytime. Just like ""European Vacation"" it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that's worth it all. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. Seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- I'm so fond of this film personally that I would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it. all very good, although I do find Brittany Murphy slightly irritating. The plot isn't very deep, but at least it is there, as many teen movies lack this vital feature. I am a little worried about the characters only being 15/16 and acting extremely maturely for their ago, however that seems to be the only problem with this movie. 7/10 "	6.8	0

I think it's highly underrated with the average of 6.4 from the imdb voters.This is a movie about black and white. A welknown theme in Hollywood, but I've never seen a movie which deals with this subject so excellent as this one.I couldn't help crying at the end. my rate: 10 soft in this regard, but this is not what the film is about. James Earl Jones's depiction of an African Cleric in this time period is amazingly accurate. I had tears in my eyes watching his performance. Harris too shines.

Dead Presidents (1995)	"is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well. Tucker as Skip (Anthony's best friend) and Rose Jackson as Juanita (Anthony's girlfriend) do make ""Dead Presidents"" a movie worth seeing at least once.  That said, I would warn not to create a preconception based on the title, tagline or any publicity images that you might have seen, because they apply only to a small portion of the action. like for blacks in the late 60's early 70's movie, a what the Viet Nam war did to those who survived it movie, so on and so on. By the time it came around for the big robbery, I was wondering when this movie would end. This problem of too grand a scope keeps the movie from getting an A. for himself, but a struggling economy and lack of formal education gradually draw him into a life of crime. An effective portrayal of black involvement in Vietnam, with good performances, powerful scenes, and shockingly graphic violence. Tate is commanding in the lead, and Tucker a real surprise as his drug-addicted pal. Not for all tastes, but well-crafted and well-made. *** a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made, but of course, bloody. This movie is filled with great performances, the best coming from Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David, heart-pounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10.

Restoration (1995)	"time Robert entered into the home for the insane, it became engrossing. I thought the story of the ""Lost Valley"" was poignant and worth the whole movie.

A little gem -selected with care- to share with those you love. way, miraculously cured of her insanity by his physical attentions. Whoever twisted Hollywood arms to get her on this project should be quartered and drawn. Considering all, this movie made me curious enough to download a copy of Samuel Pepys Diary 1665 to read more about the history of the Restoration. Isn't that what a good historical adaptation should do? be released. 'Restoration' was filmed during 1994, and was delayed for release amid rumours of re-shooting scenes with Meg Ryan, and probable cold feet after the box-office difficulties with 'The Red Letter'.This movie has not been given the credits it truly deserves, and is an excellent illustration of Court life and marriage politics during the reign of Britain's sexiest Monarch! to a new societal design in which personal gain becomes an outcome of talent and contribution and not monarchical whim. Today, we are still challenged by the notion of privilege over substance. People in power still often give major opportunities to those they favor over those that could make important contributions who are less adept at playing the political game. insane Irish girl was perhaps a bit overwrought, I found little to fault in the movie. I have seen it three times and enjoy it thoroughly each time. I'm sorry I missed it on the big screen.

Sue me I love this film to death. and makes their characters believable.It's a quick and slick film, gets to the action and gets over with before you can ask too many questions.  It's a pretty decent martial arts film, and an outstanding video game' film.  And in 1995, it was the best game-inspired film you could find.  Today it's still in the top five. franchise (as far as the big screen goes) is in limbo. But at least we have this great classic filmed by Paul Anderson! If you enjoy video game films, martial arts, or the new age MK video games, I recommend you check this film out.

But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness, especially the fights with Sub-Zero and The Scorpion. That cleverness was required over brawn in most instances was also a nice touch.Overall, this is a great film that any fans of martial arts or fantasy films should enjoy. is very special and it was one of his early works in Hollywood, so he had to prove it. And he did it. He did a good job. Keep it in mind that this movie offers you only a tiny amount of blood. Whereas the game is extremely violent. This movie, reasonably is not. It's a decent fun!

To Die For (1995)	"the picture is framed: a pseudo-documentary within a pseudo-documentary. Everything is so well orchestrated that when Kidman gets her surprising, but entirely appropriate comeuppance at the end, we are quite pleased.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!) For.  If for nothing else, the film should be seen for the work of Kidman and Douglass.  (Note also that To Die For has one of Joaquin Phoenix's earliest roles.)As other commentators here have suggested, you are not guaranteed to love this film.  Nonetheless, as far as I'm concerned, it's required viewing if you're a film fan. Phoenix is great as probably the dimmest character in movie history!Best of all is Illeana Douglas as Dillons wonderfully cynical sister.""What did i first think of her?-Four letters beginning with 'c',you know......cold!"" This is beautifully put together using mock docu footage,flashbacks,and straight filmaking.Clever,intelligent,and razor sharp,films like this are all to rare.Look out for director David Cronenberg,in a wickedly good cameo! Kidman is the perfect choice for the seductress whose emotional age seems to be about ten years old and gives new meaning to the word ""superficial."" Joaquin Phoenix shows evidence of the star he would become. Alison Folland and Illeana Douglas are excellent.I'm an admitted Nicole Kidman fan and this film shows her talent. She's also a gorgeous woman. Recommended. pace never lingers for a moment as it rapidly presents an in your face comic and tragic pastiche of dark Americana. Van Zant admirably expresses it with a bold visual flair keeping scenes lean and sharp that over a dozen years later still retain there power and energy.

She also finds a very attractive young man, tempting her to cheat. What follows are stories told by and about each of the women in the quilting circle. The young women discovers that love is not perfect, and that you must take advantage of what you have, and that there is beauty in the known. what makes it special. Fast, but special. And the final highpoint, a literal ""storm"" that blows everything apart yet puts everything together, is a cinematic masterpiece, proof of heartfelt, imaginative work of both the writer and the director. They´re actually dreaming an ending together - just take this lovely movie in and stop bickering about reality. If you ask me. but it would take too long to mock them all.  The real trouble with the movie is that it was so earnest, so desperate to convince the audience of its poetic depths, that it wound up shallow, unsatisfying, unconvincing and unintentionally funny.Or, to put it another way--never have so many, who were so talented, worked on something so ordinary. like this are, first of all, even made, and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. There are many far better films about women and their unique experiences, the most recent one being a small film called High Art, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and starring Ally Sheedy in one of 1998's best performances.

In essence this film made it easier to come to terms with my own sexuality, because of that it will always have a special place in my heart. to actually viewing this film.  When I finally bought the film and watched it, it definately went beyond my expectations.  Everything about the film was near perfect.

A near perfect film. her boyfriend and the Christian school job. The circus performances scenes were great and interesting. The lovemaking scene between them is very passionate and romantic.

Highly recommended. this being a prime one.Since accidentally buying this film a week ago, I've been watching it almosteveryday. It is a very moving piece, incredibly romantic and beautifully shot.

Usual Suspects, The (1995)	"again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time. too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening... a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts. a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying. Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5 stars out of 5. "	8.6	1

The climax is a relatively large-scale speedboats-and-helicopter chase, but most of it appears to have been done by stunt doubles and is not very exciting. (**1/2) finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be.all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie.it's not like 'yes,madam'! or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10 awful wardrobe, which includes a really nasty pair of baggy denim jeans with stone washed areas on the seat that are far from flattering.After lots of so-so bouts of kicking and punching (plus plenty more fashion disasters from all concerned), the film wraps matters up with a mediocre chase scene involving a jet-ski, a helicopter, and a pair of speedboats.

Mighty Aphrodite (1995)	"his pictures.The story of ""Mighty Aphrodite"" is magic, light, funny and beautiful. The idea of the Greek chorus is just incredible! All the cast is great, but the best one is really Mira Sorvino. She deserved her Oscar playing Linda Ash, a nice and ingenuous prostitute.So if you like Woody Allen's films, you'll surely love this one like I did. she lacked chemistry with Woody.  Good also to see F Murray Abraham as the leader of the chorus - why do we see so little of him these days?I'm a fan of Woody, but he has been patchy in the last 10 years or so.  With this one, he really was in sparkling form.  Well worth seeing. own.Leave it to Woody Allen to deliver a film that is fascinating on many levels and is as beautifully structured as anything you're likely to see all year. I don't believe it's Best Picture material, but it does show a very strong return to form for Allen, no matter how unsure he is of reentering the war between the sexes. wants to improve the life of the hooker-come-porn-star and suggests hairdressing and teaming up with a half-wit boxer (who he met through his job as a sports writer) he thinks she will like.

Recommended. in for Mia Farrow just as well as Kenneth Branagh stood in for the Woodmeister in ""Celebrity"" - and how incestuous can we get here).

Lamerica (1994)	the significance of this simple act hits home with the force of a sledgehammer.Now released on DVD, 'Lamerica', one of the least typical but best films of the 90s, is well worth seeking out.  And even if (like me) you have to wait 9 years for a second viewing, I promise that its imagery will linger in your mind. with some of it. even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.  this film should be watched by all interested in understanding why people have to abandon their homelands. this is a perfect example and should open eyes to many. lire, only to get swallowed up by the depth of the Albanian situation. directing amazes me everytime more and more. A powerful movie, being very realistic and documentary. Once again, Enrico Lo Verso acting and leading the movie is great. This movie was filmed few years after the government was overthrown and I consider AMelio to be brave with this theme and from my understanding he reflected what happened in a realistic way. is also a lot of authenticity as Lamerica is based on the real story about the collapse of Albania after the end of a very long communist rule.How an affluent culture is blindly followed by a less fortunate culture has also been vividly described in Lamerica. This is exactly an element which makes the whole story palatable to audiences' tastes. 	7.6	1

Georgia (1995)	"admire the daring it took to include it.'Georgia' is a good, solid, if not spectacular film about sibling rivalry and family relations. Leigh is good in her role, as is Mare Winningham as the more subdued title character. Of the supporting cast I especially liked Max Perlich as a hero-worshiping fan that Sadie uses by turning him into her husband. a terrific job with very difficult material (about a very unusual and difficult, but interesting, lifestyle), and this movie calls out to me to watch it every time it plays on my satellite service.This movie should not be judged along with ""standards"".  It is a rare piece of filmwork, and should be judged entirely on its own standalone merits. because of this, the narrative arc is limited (especially as the film is quite long). In some senses, the film resembles other great films about the self-destructive, like 'Five Easy Pieces' or 'Naked'. It's not quite in that class, but it's double-headed structure makes it more reflective, less visceral, but by no means uninteresting. Overall, it's an unjustly neglected work. summation, this film will appeal to people who drink too much, people who tell me that it's a sin to know and feel too much within, which according to Bob Dylan many claim to live by and i concur; those with a penchant for '90s Seattle, rock and roll and dark character studies into alcoholism, thwarted ambition and pervasive despair. Leigh's believable portrayal, but had a more sympathetic character with which to work.  The stand-out, though, is Max Perlich as Sadie's worshipful husband/doormat.  My heart broke for him.  While the acting was strong, I found this film exhausting and kept checking to see how much time was left - it felt more like an assignment than entertainment. "	6.5	0

Great movie. a theme that permeates the movie: such as when the father watches the home movie of his children, illuminating one of the pivital moments of his life that was only seconds in length, but brings his life such joy and meaning.  The movie reminds us that it is ""the very thought of you"" that brings joy to us all. The director's commentary by Foster gives a clue that he was frustrating to work with, but it seems very worth it here. He is just SO watchable, boistrous, too-energetic, motor-mouthed and loveable.

Watch this movie if you are disillusioned with the notion of romance, and need some succour. The movie once again reinforces my admiration for the Italian film-makers.

""Il Postino"" won't blow you away, but its tender lessons about life, love, and friendship will stick with you for some time, urging another viewing. Bottom Line: A very European romance that is better than most anything Hollywood can conjure up.  8/10.

Mel Gibson could use a little poetry himself.Grade: A her. They're a fair representation of a real couple who were brought together for what might have been the wrong reasons.

With just a bit of profanity early on and a bit of obvious political correctness, there is nothing in here which should offend viewers. Critics didn't seem to care for it, so you know it truly was a nice, wholesome film....and fun to watch. the tearful ending just right for a young audience. Interesting to note Steve Coogan plays a miniature model come to life - something he repeats later in his career in A Night At The Museum. Typecasting?The effects are also very good. Remember this is 1995 when CGI was in it's infancy - but the miniaturisation of the cast is flawless. is such a natural.  He's completely believable, as is his friend. The Indian is also wonderfully brought to life.  How they made the special effects work so well back in 1995 (well... that was a while back for film special effects anyway...) I don't know.  I wish we could see more warm hearted films like this today. performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids (like ""Inspector Gadget"" - a truly awful film) and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it. like this is that they are pure fantasy and they feature the type of things that most young kids dream about.

However every scene is pushed hard by director John Schlesinger. Kiefer is all greased up. This is not a subtle movie but it could do with some. It's unnerving but in a bad way.

The rape scenes are very disturbing, I warn you. You might need a strong stomach, especially for the scene I described with Karen on the phone with her daughter. The ending is a little short and felt rushed, but I would always recommend this for a watch.8/10 is a shame that lawyers use breaches in the laws to defend scums like the character Robert Doob, but that is the sad reality. The praiseworthy attitude of Karen McCann is an exception but perfectly understood in the situation. The acting is excellent and the plot is timeless. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Olho por Olho"" (""Eye for an Eye"") the scene is VERY graphic in nature.

The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.

Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind, and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually, though, he learns to accept and deal with these challenges, and becomes more loving and appreciative. I recommend ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for musicians, singers, music teachers, and really everyone. Enjoy the show! my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.

This movie isn't a total spoof of movies with a couple of original jokes here and there.

Two if by Sea (1996)	"mixture of charm, sarcasm, and innocence play out well.  The movie knows it's not too sophisticated or shrewd (even the cop says of his own investigation, ""this is too easy"") and it's a great film to watch on an afternoon or just to be entertained.  If you're a Sandra fan, you'll like it no matter what.  :) where Leary was going fishing and he shoots one of the fish.  Then he cooks it up, serves it up to Bullock and she spits out a bullet.

Leary is consistently Leary (maybe he was born a fully developed adult), while Bullock in 1996 is growing into the superstar that we know today.

Bio-Dome (1996)	"the lame jokes and one dimensional, almost cartoon like characters. You have to wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to go ahead and make it. The movie ensnares the viewer by opening with a promising start. The movie quickly deteriorates from there. Stephen Baldwin only adds to the overall idiocy. As if one bad actor wasn't enough. not by much, and its sad, because I've seen him in other roles which he played incredibly well. I usually find at least some redeeming features in 'stoner' movies, or even like them-- (the Clerks series, Bill and Ted, etc.)-- but this movie is just really bad. The supposed protagonists are so idiotic and obnoxious that its painful to watch. low user rating of 3.8 when movies like ""You don't mess with the Zohan"" which is possibly the worst film ever made manage to get over 5.0!!!! Bio-dome is a great ""swith-off your brain"" type of film which shouldn't be taken seriously at all. So crank out the beers or the bong or both and just zone into the dome! films as Outside Providence, Double Tap and Double Bang.But back with the film...For you who have had the privilege, yes PRIVILEGE to have enjoyed this film, I'm sure you will agree that this classic must never be forgotten, and certainly this awe-struck fan will always have it at the forefront of his mind.Go for the Baldwin, stay for the Shore... and Shore fans or family related.After the film bombed in American cinemas, in Australia it was decided by it's distributors that it would be dumped straight to video-store shelves, even though it had huge Aussie-born singing star Kylie Minogue(Dr. Petra von Kant) co-staring.

Two Bits (1995)	The situations our protagonist gets into are sometimes funny, sometimes sad. As trivial as his quest to get 25 cents may seem, I wanted him to accomplish it.  The ending is sad, though not unexpected.  Mainly, it's the richly developed characters and their interactions that make this a solid film.  My score:  8 (out of 10) may consider it bad taste - if not unethical - to use the Great Depression for the setting of a nearly magical story, but I wish to assert that the movie did a very impressive job portraying the setting without getting sappy; then again, how could an Al Pacino movie be sappy? I recommend it. Also starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. like a good book: hard to put down once you start. At 84 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, either. Even though there is little profanity, I would not recommend this as family fare because the film touches on a disturbing doctor and his wife.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and glad to see it's out on DVD now, too. but very personal journey. I've seen this film about 10 times and have never made it all the way through without crying. This is a beautiful film in todays blockbuster big movie era. No special effects just emotions. Definitely better than 5.8 out of 10 I would say more like 8 out of 10. Mary Elizabeth and Al are magnificent- this director could only be worse.Hats of to the writer: Joseph Stefano. Because beside the fact that the film itself has a decent plot, the final sentence as i said before really blew me away. This movie is readable in different ways so everybody can enjoy it. Only thing is everybody will read different things in it. A must see... 	6.3	0
French Twist (Gazon maudit) (1995)	"to the human relationships that develop in this bizarre triangle. The script could have been a little less linear, but the characters are well developed and well played. Overall, French twist is a fun light comedy which probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow in Europe but will need a very open minded audience in the US. Unfortunately we're not ready yet. that everything will work out well in the end. And it does. The moral of the story, affirmed at the end, is that the only things that matter are love, tenderness and affection and if we get those the source's sexual gender is immaterial; we are all bisexual.This is a bright, witty and observant comedy, well-acted, particularly by Victoria Abril, of those in films. However, when the masculine Marijo, played poignantly by Josiane Balasko, enters their lives, the story takes many unexpected and entertaining turns which render a fairly common theme completely unpredictable. Everyone to whom I recommend this film ends up watching it numerous times and recommending it to others. The soundtrack is now one of my most-played CD's. (Alain Chabat) will have to go through.3. I gave a rating of 6 because it's not a masterpiece. But if you find the plot outline attracting, if you ever wonder ""What would I do if my wife leaves me for another woman ?"", or if you want to see an uncommon film about relationships, you will not be disappointed ! Instantly accessible to monolinguists - and yet its panache and pace could only be French (yeah, I know Abril is Spanish).Incidentally, I know we're not really supposed to respond to other comments from IMDb users, but it's interesting to note that the movie-loving community displays just as much intolerance and uptightness about sexuality as any other disparate group of people.

The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like? don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see. his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10 	7.3	0

Kicking and Screaming is a film deserving to be recognize as a journey through the minds of graduates and self-discovery of oneself.  Grover's speech at the airline ticket counter may be the best monologue in the history of cinema.  Am I gushing irrationally here?  Perhaps a little.  But this film needs to be seen and recognized as the little gem (that's often better than anything else in the same genre done by a major studio/director) that it is. of this film (need the DVD to come out before my tape wears out).So I can't say enough about this film.

The story and characters are as unique as they are addictive. When the movie ended, I found myself wanting more. This is one movie that will stick with you. I dare you to watch it only once.If you enjoyed Bed of Roses, you might also like At First Sight with Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. open up his heart again, too.

It is a bouquet of humor, heartache, and happy endings that will have you floating on air, smiling like crazy. The only downfall was the trite script, but that was more than made up for by the wonderful acting, and the beautiful idea of the story.

Screamers (1995)	fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10 ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal.  By their standards, I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything.  These surface similarities will always be there.  One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory.  In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!! pulled off the sort of paranoia we saw in The Thing, there was some nice tension as the story unfolded, although it fell apart a bit at the end.Bottom line - if you're a sci fi fan sniffing around for some sci fi you haven't seen but don't want to sit through a total dog, it's not a bad renter. style endings - although in fairness it isn't quite as bad as that.  The special effects are a bit ropey but do the job - after all this is a very low budget movie.The whole thing is not as good as it could have been but is certainly head and shoulders above a lot of low budget sci-fi thrillers. end is very surprising and tense. Weller and Rubin really shine in these scenes and do well to affect the audience's emotions. The script, which is good throughout, is also especially good in the final sequence.With more money behind it and better direction, Screamers would be a Sci-Fi classic, as it is, Screamers is an underrated, well acted, great story. 	6.4	0

Instead of more action it would have been interesting if the ethical aspect of a compromised juror (albeit unwillingly) could have been explored in the spirit of 12 Angry Men.

Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the villain and Anne Heche gives all she has as the token best friend.

Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995)	"legitimate but failing business, ""After Life Advice"" for people who are terminally ill and wish to pass on a legacy to their loved ones beyond the grave.Everyone involved with this film should be proud of their accomplishment. It is a great film and unfortunately hasn't been seen by many, by my account anyway. Let's see if we can't change that. Spike Lee's new film, the issues of mortality, and aspirations and dreams are key. The film's sombre tone is perfect - not too downbeat (there are many hilarious and happy moments), but enough to make us understand the importance of the issues at stake. Aside from staunch, happy-to-be-cynical other imdb reviewers, the film will affect, and perhaps even instruct. Recommended. Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards.Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10 you like films like Usual Suspects that combine the action genre with actual thought and character development rent this film and see if you can watch it only once.  In the same ballpark try Way Of The Gun with Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe, another film where ""pretty boys"" are actually allowed to explore their craft of acting. a unique voice as a writer, and this film attempts to create its own reality.  All those who say they 'hate' this film should rent their copy of HAPPY GILMORE and keep their opinions to themselves.

They happen to be mainly women, which is a refreshing change in a world where so often the female characters are only there as props for the male stars. I give it fourteen thumbs up! this film. It flies in the face of convention, but that is its beauty. Some would fear the freedoms this film demonstrates.Love and acceptance abound, in a timeless manor. I like the way it offered a different definition of family, one where diversity is an asset, guarded by respect.This is one of the greatest stories to come across the screen. these issues, showing women's strength in dealing with religious hypocrites and single motherhood, but I personally didn't feel the film was encouraging all women to leave the church or raise up families independently.  It's a marvelous story of women's strengths and vulnerabilities, and the love that the women in one family share.  ALL people will enjoy this film. (naratively essential) scenes of violence make it inappropriate for young or sensitive children. It is overall, however, not gritty or depressing.

It's clear Jaglom's working on a shoestring budget knows a few people in the business and makes the most of what he has. I usually admire scrappy auteurs like Herzog and Fuller who have to sacrifice for their independence, but with that freedom must come form, content and talent, none of which Jaglom displays in this pompous loser. a legendary matriarch whose attempts at self-effacement never quite ring true.This is a funny, loving look into the foibles of a theater family -- their fatuously ego-driven yet heart rending issues. For theater lovers and mature fans of Ibsen, Chekov, Joyce, Mike Leigh, Bergman or Allen ""Last Summer"" will be satisfying. For others, be forewarned. You may miss the point. example, the scene where Oona goes to see her producer at a sandwich shop; their dialog, and that last moment where he's trying to get a kiss out of her and she's barely resisting--one of the best moments I've seen on film.If you like good acting, thick psychological stuff, colorful characters, preening never-been jackasses, and deep humanity, see this film. ever-changing toehold into theater from whomever will grant her one.For those who are game- and it does get better with repeated viewings- there is a lot of humanity and warmth under all the dysfunction on display, and Foyt and Lindfors are standouts in a cast that does a good job of inhabiting characters who clearly need to get over themselves.

Byatt novella ""Morpho Eugenia"", however, that is going to be my next project. Naturally, I would be curious to see how the film and the novella compare. Either way, I still feel that ""Angels and Insects"" deserves my highest regards.  Several have complained about the actors, saying that there is not a single stand-out performance.  I disagree, as both Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas (in a performance worthy of an oscar nomination) acquit themselves well.  The script is also very well written, and the costumes deserved the Oscar nomination.  One of the ten best of 1996. tinsel and trappings. Those, however, who can get past all that will find a masterpiece of filming, acting, directing, writing, costuming, orchestration, etc. A slowly captivating and somewhat melancholy story of the goings-on within an English manor, ""A&I"" delivers powerful drama, sterling performances, and masterful execution by the auteur. A great watch for those who love cinema for cinema's sake. "	7.0	0
White Squall (1996)	"team. A truly moving story and another great film by Ridley Scott. From struggles to strengths, this is an inspiring film to watch with many good actors, Jeff bridges is really good for this role playing a tough, wise teacher for the boys. I love this as it is based on a true story, it makes it even more moving. the voyage under the watchful eye of an Ahab-esque but eventually sympathetic Jeff Bridges. The final scene most definitely resembles that of Dead Poets' Society. (Captain. My Captain). However the film as a whole never bores and makes for compulsive viewing at times particularly the superb storm of the title, that is both moving as well technical tour de force. few parts but unless you intended it to be a 3 month long movie some parts had to ""wind up on the cutting floor"" as one poor soul commented. People just watch movies nowadays rather than ""live"" them, understand them, try to find out what the message was. This movie showed soul, it moves me every time I watch it. except for maybe the final scene, in my eyes White Squall lives up to this.I think this is an enjoyable movie, when you're just lying back on the couch relaxing and let it flow over you. No difficult story, but it has great shots and pretty good acting and most of the characters are reasonably developed.7,5 (for making us cry) acting is excellent in all cases. As a Jeff Bridges fan, I was surprised I'd never heard of it before it appeared on late night TV. The last looks exchanged between the captain and his wife are about as good as they get. Not a really great movie but I found it well worthwhile as a non-fan of action movies. "	6.6	0
Dunston Checks In (1996)	"to see. She shows a nice comedic touch. The chimpanzee is probably the most entertaining, which is the idea, but so is the villain played by Rupert Evert. In other words, there are a lot of likable characters in this movie.This a ""sleeper:"" an underrated film that a lot of people would enjoy. I'm sorry it never got much ""press."" an ape, not a monkey) is well in its place as a comedy actor, and as said - the ideas are good, the working-out is even better.Not 'the best movie you'll ever see', not even close. Not a 'must-see movie'. But a very pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. And enjoyable for both adults and children, that's worth something too. manager of a major hotel is stretch, at least initially due to his stereotype; however, after watching it a half hour you forget that it is ""George"" and get involved with the other characters.Another reason to watch is to see Faye Dunaway's amazing post-op face lift and Pee-wee Herman as the ""Animal Catcher""? Good, clean fun for the whole family! Faye Dunaway plays the same kind of character that she played in ""Network"", only bitchier. And if it seems that I try too hard to analyze a movie like this, so be it. Above all, I still consider Faye Dunaway REALLY hot! And I'm sure that I always will.Also starring Jason Alexander, Rupert Everett and Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman). without Dunston Checks In? In some Hollywood executive's trash, that's where. Because of pioneer movies like ""Dunston Checks In"" movies like MVP and MXP enjoy much commercial success. So grab your kids, round up the neighbor, pop some popcorn, and get ready to laugh, and cry at one of the best movies in the last twenty years: ""Dunston Checks In"". "	5.3	0
Black Sheep (1996)	"BOY has a lot more of them. Watch TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP back to back and prepare to laugh like you have never laughed before. Chris Farley and David Spade are, in my opinion, the funniest duo ever to appear onscreen. It's a shame they didn't get to make a more movies together before Farley's death. My rating: ***1/2 collapses on top of Spade during the hail storm and the ""Power to the People"" speech at the rock concert are hilarious.Most viewed this film as inane and childish - one reviewer I distinctly remember said that he would rather have Des O'Connor sing him the phone book than watch this again - but I found myself laughing many times. Heslov, and Bruce McGill. All of them were funny as hell. Maybe with the exception of Gary Busey's character, who I must admit was pretty stupid. The film had a good story though, and it was sweet-natured along iwth being majorly crude and funny. I recommend ALMOST HEROES and TOMMY BOY *if* you liked this movie. BLACK SHEEP gets 4/5. Busey, for example, is brilliantly cast as a paranoid Vietnam veteran and comes through with the funniest performance by far. Chris Farley has barely one or two mildly funny moments in the entire film, but he does achieve some touching ones, and his honest efforts to amuse his audience in any way he can at least earn your respect.

It's not a classic thriller but it's quite an original idea and plot and almost manages to keep the tension for the whole movie. is solid as the father in a role that's different from a lot of his earlier roles.  The always excellent Walken is, as usual, awesome as the bad guy, a role I always love to see him in.  The film keeps you going, by offering a couple of nice twists.  Ignore the reviews and rent this movie. gets involved in a deadly plot.  An intriguing plot that had me thinking what I would do in the situation.  Christopher Walken was, as usual, creepy and Johnny Depp was believable.  The rest of the cast was very competent.  I'd advise renting it.  Not a special effects extravaganza but a nicely written fast moving movie. at times, the film nearly falls apart from the unlikely false plot moment near the third act and an unsatisfying conclusion. Despite all this, this is a well directed picture that certainly worth a look of this truly real mixed bag film. Written by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Courage Under Fire, A Home of Our Own, Mr. Holland's Opus).

This  is a powerful film about a man's struggle to follow his conscience despite a world that  insists he do otherwise.  I can't believe that until today (Aug 3, 2003), I had not seen this  film.  Too bad movies like this aren't made more often. Excellent acting, writing,  directing, cinematography.  A++ the kind of conclusion that makes many other films seem incomplete and shallow. This is an excellent film. It's also very family-friendly aside from some thematic elements (a slave is cleaved in half, animals are slaughtered, and so forth). I purchased it on a whim and never regretted the twenty bucks I spent. Everyone should see this at least once. with such wonderful stories of pioneers struggling to fit in with neighbors, families mingling beliefs and faith. Our forefathers have been in Buncombe county since Revolution days. With little access to this area, it has until recently been untouched with modernization. Our people were simple but lived as Kings. Jason Patric was wonderful in this movie. I am a fan. If you want a movie that will boost your hope, this is a movie for that. I think it is hard to believe that this movie wasn't seen on the big screen, or really advertised. It has excellent immersion, and doesn't look or feel like a cheap movie. I think it is one of the best stories told in film. 	6.6	0
Mary Reilly (1996)	" It should not be written off as just another big-budget Hollywood failure, because its aims, whether conscious or not, are quite different from your average thriller or period film.   Approach it with an open mind, be prepared for a dark and disconcerting vision, and you might be rewarded because this film is unique, baroque, different and great. which she must survive...While the dialect is at times choppy, she is believable as an Irish maid; and the supporting cast also lends credence to this story. Malkovich varies his performance between Jekyll/Hyde, and it is effective and visceral.If you initially avoided this film, I would highly recommend seeing it now. The atmosphere and music are haunting and sad. 9/10 (played by John Malkovich) when he didn't change facial appearances! And, yes, the film, generally- speaking, is a real downer, a depressing tale. Yet, for some odd reason, despite the above paragraph, I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and subtle suspense, even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating. is very quiet and slow and may put some viewers to sleep.  Another issue I had was the lovely Henson-Workshop-provided effects at the end, which are imaginative, but don't make a bit of sense when compared to the rest of the film.  If you can stomach a quiet and very subtle thriller, however, this is a real gem. dour chambermaid, and I think that's what put off so many people.  Obviously, most people like their Julia flashing her now $20 million dollar smile.  I say, ""good for you for trying something different.""

Vampire in Brooklyn (1995)	"problem. Now, looking back almost twenty years later, the wig does not look bad, and this was far from rock bottom for Murphy. For Craven, it may not be his strongest film, but it may also not be his worst (""Cursed"" is pretty bad).Seriously, this is not that bad of a film, even if the humor never hits exactly right. the Nutty Professor films is no less abrupt than those between horror and comedy in ""Vampire"".It's just that the choice of horror as the second element mixed with the comedy is a more daring and unusual one.Years from now, ""A Vampire in Brooklyn"" will be viewed as one of the highpoints of the second phase of the Eddie Murphy Genre. have to say that Eddie Murphy makes a good vampire. His version of a vampire is cool but SO totally evil.And his sidekick Kadeem Hardison(also seen in the movie Drive) is funny. In all a good movie. I guarantee that once you start watching this movie you'll be hooked and wont want to finish watching it until the end. 8/10 But Eddie pulled it off. Yes- I feel that he truly did. He had that hypnotic stare and seductive movement that would've paralyzed me too if I was in his presence then too. So I give this movie the thumbs up and not just for vampire lovers and not just for Eddie Murphy fans- this is quite an entertaining film. have noticed that many of his films have pretty poor ratings here on IMDB, including this one, which has a shockingly low rating.I thought the film had very funny moments, and Murphy had a good rapport with his Ghoul. Also, the plotline was pretty interesting. I thought it worked very well, and I hope that the IMDB rating will improve. "	4.5	0

I own the Blu-ray disc, btw this was very hard and difficult to get on Blu-ray. Hard Target was easy this movie wasn't easy to get. John Woo, John Travolta and Christian Slater all did a wonderful job. wouldn't work. He's done too many goody-goody roles to come back down to this. Laws of nature will not allow him to make another good movie where he plays a bad guy. Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one. on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Blu-ray's to get me this movie on Blu-ray I actually have this film in Blu-ray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find. I have them both on Blu-ray discs. Travolta overdoes the psycho routine, hamming it up when some restraint would have made for a more believable performance, but his considerable charm sees him through.  Christian Slater, an actor who hasn't impressed me as anything more than a Jack Nicholson wannabe, makes a surprisingly commendable hero. This movie is junk food, of course, but it's very tasty indeed. its up to Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis to save the world.. Overall a good action flick with a leave your brain at home plot..Travolta goes slightly over the top with his character but is still good..Slater is ok and Mathis does what she can with what little the script gives her.. on a scale of one to ten... 6 	6.0	0

This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this. It is, however, their loss.It's hard to recommend this film highly enough, but I should add that more than one viewing is required to get the best from La Haine. very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel. A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.10/10 a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.This certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s.

I bought the film at what you British call a jumble sale for $2.00 (American money), so I'm not out a lot of loot in any case. I will keep the film alongside ""Love, Honour and Obey"", another second-hand bargain I found along the way. It too, has redeeming features. a good movie. The story, all the action aside, is really about Billy's seething self-hate and unwillingness to love and be loved. The cars, the ram-raiding, the police, Tommy, the estate... it's all just a backdrop to the story of the slow and tragic destruction of an depressed young man caught in a world he has learned only to hate. and Sadie are far too posh for the criminal underworld characters. Sadie's accent is eventually recognisable as a strain of Irish, sounding slightly like Jerry Adams on helium. This film wants to be an urban Mad Max and ends up looking like what it is  a posh cast trying to play scum and looking embarrassingly out of their depth. he'd already attempted to chat up a stranger in a club! It reinforces one's perception of him as a big kid unwilling to grow up. . . Characters' actions have to be believable, and his aren't.

Not that it doesn't have style, mind you. And, Jonathan Pryce, Sean Bean, and Marianne Faithful help make the trip.

At times, one can only marvel at the audacity of this guy: whether badgering known drug-dealers and pimps until they all but plead with him to GO AWAY, or making what amounts to crank calls to an underworld enforcer (and possible ex-Moussad hit man) Broomfield walks through it all with a zeal it is hard not to admire. itself. Only Fleiss, after finally granting Broomfield an interview, seems halfway on the level, coming across as surprisingly down-to-earth, sharp, attractive and witty - if not entirely trustworthy. It's the one moment of grace. But for the most part, this film is akin to being stalked by evil, chuckling pimps while trapped in an ever replicating maze of funhouse mirrors. Darryl Gates, who accepts a nice cash sum before his interview; crooked top detective Mike B. (can't think of his name right now); and porn stars Ron Jeremy and Tisa.

City Hall (1996)	 But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the end.  I wish I could like this more, but no. in this day and age without gratuitous sex, violence, bombs and bullets, profanity.On a cinematic level, I found the directing, acting (the entire cast) and production to be first rate.I realize that many, many people (possibly the large majority) don't see things as I've described here. But if what I've written resonates, then you'll probably like this movie a lot. mentioned. The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable. As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays. together, and the supports from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press.

Bottle Rocket (1996)	"characterisation enables the viewer to develop understanding and affection for the protagonists as the story slowly unravels. In ""Bottle Rocket"" this is supported by strong performances, especially that of Owen Wilson, who proves his actor potential in an atypical role.Though not flawless, (there is a lack of narrative urgency at times), this movie leaves the viewer ultimately entertained and charmed. subtle humor and deliveries by the actors make the movie stand out in it's own little version comedy. The characters are losers, but lovable. You can't help but cheer them on even though what they do is illegal. I highly recommend this cool little film. It's an excellent introduction into the wonderful films of Wes Anderson.RATING: **** out of **** struggle to realize his dream of becoming a crook in spite of his many shortcomings: sensitivity, compassion, empathy, and just plain niceness. Luke Wilson plays straight man to real life brother Owen in this camp, light-hearted, and easy to watch little film about the ""gang who couldn't think straight"". A fun watch for just about anyone into droll humorous subtleties. so self -involved and moody like most independent films can be. And while it has a bright appeal, it is more eccentric than campy like most mainstream comedies can be. This is truly a unique comedy and I get the feeling that one day, the lines of hipness will be drawn between who has seen this movie and who hasn't. lovely film, I really don't see how you couldn't like it. Some how this just misses out on being a real classic on a level with Big Lebowski, maybe its because not as many people have seen it or something, either way its definitely in my top ten or top five or something.

Tim Curry looked like he was having the time of his life playing Long John Silver amidst a sea of Muppets.  I had great fun watching his performance. Go watch this movie if there's even a spark of kid in you.  You won't regret it. plays Long John Silver to perfection. Billy Connolly is also worth mentioning, despite his brief appearance in the film.  And young Jim Hawkins is just as he should be, albeit surrounded by a crew of muppet pirates.This is my favorite Muppet film, and I think everybody should give it a try and embrace a different sort of humor-filled extravaganza. sure beats the hell outta ""The great muppet caper"" (How slow was that movie?!). Tim Curry, the greatest and most under rated musical preformer alive, is at his element here. The music is awsome and his one song (""Upstage Lads, this is me only number!"") is awsome. This is a good movie. For a pirate movie, and a muppet movie. to be annoying and forgettable, but not this one.I've watched it about 30 or 40 times (the joy of having a young child who is hooked on one show :-)I don't get tired of it. Fun songs, Tim Curry is enough to watch the film anyway, good plot.Where else will you hear a name like 'big fat baby-eating O'Brian' ??? Tim Curry for his fine job as Long John Silver, and to the entire cast of puppeteers, without who this film would not be possible. The relationship between Silver and Jim is also well-developed, as it is difficult to watch them part at the end. The songs are fun, the ending touching..and of course, humorous! Give this movie another try. "	7.0	0
Headless Body in Topless Bar (1995)	"it was SOOO intense and I loved it because I felt like I had actually experienced something that made me think about human nature, the will to survive, and the pain of vulnerability.If you are looking for a provocative, thought provoking movie this is a sure bet. It you want light hearted entertainment rent something with Meg Ryan in it. sit through multiple takes of these incredibly painful, poorly- written scenes.  But most of all, I feel sorry for my friends and myself.  We lost an hour of our lives to this movie, and we can never, ever get that hour back.If this review keeps one person from making the same mistake, then my work here is done.... they were very believable. This movie was quite different and intriuging to watch especially after learning that it is based on an actual event that caused the New York Post to headline ""Headless body in Topless Bar"" back in the 80's. Not a movie for everyone but if you like dark and disturbing films you might just enjoy this one. friend watching strippers while Joe comments on the size of their, em, talents.   From the style this could almost be a student or art film, as surreal as it is, but it is the real deal.  Stay away unless you like to see Burbons poured down the neck of a headless guy by a faithful best friend. movie, and the worst part is the ending song. some homemade thing with these words ""its in awful condition the world is a mess. when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed. the cops they are clueless, eating donuts in their car. newspaperflash next morning: headless body,topless bar.""

Braveheart (1995)	shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films. amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century. and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.Out of ten............10/10! away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga. Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more importantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry, vivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history. Along with the unforgettable 'Alba gu bragh!' and the unprecedentedly heart-stopping 'Freeeeedom', Braveheart unquestionably is one of the greatest movies ever made. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level. True, the historical content may have been distorted, but even though, this movie is meant for entertainment. It is not a history lesson caught on video.The acting is absolutely superb, this movie is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat for the entire three hours. 	8.4	1
Taxi Driver (1976)	"of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label. 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece. me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does. seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5 Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation. "	8.3	1

The story got me to thinking what I would have done if any of my teenage children had gotten into a similar bind. With a great writer and director this could have been a ""10"" movie. I rate it 7 of 10. coming out of their mouths were often so silly, it makes you wonder how the same person who wrote 'The Silence of the Lambs' also wrote this screenplay. Overall, despite the script flaws, it has quite a good mystery, and besides the young daughter, a brilliant cast. It is worth a watch, if just for the main casts' beautiful performances. criminal justice system, where defence and prosecution teams become engaged in brinkmanship designed to sway the jury one way or another. Ted Tally's screenplay makes a number of similar points, but the narrative begins to drift around the halfway mark and never really recovers. Some will be won over by the cast and production values, others won't be so forgiving. a feature film that, without movie star names attached, would have ended up as made for TV.  This is a weak script with bad, predictable dialogue - very disappointing with such a cast. With some reworking, it might have been a very powerful family story, perhaps never as compelling as Ordinary People, for instance, but better than it was. how the actors responded to each other as members of a family, and I found that they were not only well cast, but were all up to the challenge, delivering themselves quite honorably. This incident could have happened to any ordinary family, and there but for the grace of God, go I.Of four ****, I rate three and a half. "	6.1	0

You bet! to Margaret's ""Cost of Coal"" museum which she opens as an expression righteous indignation. The museum sequences bookend the main story (told in a long flashback).

A few little story holes that were slightly annoying - an uncle supposedly out on bail for arson back in his old job lickety split and a grandchild that had disappeared - but not enough to detract from an overall fine film. Even the second time around! their toll on the mine workers and their families. Not just another coal mining flick, ""MM"" focuses with musings, humor, and poignant moments on Margaret, who's nose is always running, and her assorted quirky family and friends. An engrossing, somewhat compelling, and almost charming little film, ""MM"" should appeal to those with a taste for slice-of-life flicks involving eccentric folk. a script that takes a real, human character and gives her one such bizarre action to commit. But ""Margaret's Museum"" is a fascinating, unexpected film. It takes a well-used dramatic arc and directs it toward uncommon places. It captures the spirit and feel of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Something I've known quite well, and could always feel more. See this. "	7.3	0

I think to myself, ""How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?"" This being the case, though, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start.  It's a story that everyone should know. the Frank family, and Anne in particular. Although it is a bit slow moving at first (detailing their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful.Due to some of the footage and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it for children but for adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through one young girl.

Absurdity and grimness are very skillfully balanced. A marvelous, overlooked film. film but one that has enough going for it to be worht watching.  However it should be noted that it is quite cruel and upsetting  we are not allowed to feel anything for Graham's victims.  The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark. reacting to poison, but these are necessary to heighten the audience's horror at Graham's incapability to assess his own actions and to recognize his own evil.  Ross gives us an entertaining, yet twisted, glimpse into genius gone wrong, without sensationalizing Graham as a hero.It is also very hard to go out for drinks or coffee after seeing this movie. ""Clockwork"" are almost inevitable, but unlike Kubrick's thriller, this one has a more subtle, menacing tone, for the mind rather than for the eye.  It's not a laugh-out-loud film, though it's undeniably hilarious.  Whatever you feel, it's kept inside.If you're one with a sensitive stomach, suicidal tendencies, strange addictions, goody-goodies/puritans, then stay away.  Otherwise, WATCH THIS FILM! humor in this black comedy right on target and I actually felt sorry for the young poisoner.

Wearing funny hats and talking in different rhythms, Schaeffer doesn't really overplay or underplay--he's a goofy mensch, but not a dynamic one like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. He's careful to give his character some shading, yet the quirks--like much of the serious dialogue--are superficial. *1/2 from **** had extricated herself from a dead-end relationship!)

I'll admit that I couldn't stand watching the last 20 minutes, but I do know how it ends. Anyway, it would have turned out better if Joe came out of the closet.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It should get a rating of 1. Don't watch this movie! Maybe people talking about spitting in each other's mouths could be slightly funny if the writer had any talent or could sense any direction, but no. Evaluating the performances is pointless, since any actor working with this material is obviously in too much pain to develop a character.  Save your money and life, avoid this movie at all costs! to understand that love is much more stronger than lust. If you didn't enjoy this movie the first time viewing...give it another chance.

I've since warmed up to it (and removed my negative comments in this edit). Take that for what it's worth -- and I hope it's worth something, because I'm not a big fan of eating crow in public. to be a comedy with a moral message, this actually has no redeeming features whatsoever. From the lack of decent jokes to Garcia's squabbling siblings, it's a film that will have you looking at your watch more often than you look at the screen. When the supporting cast of livestock out-act everybody and everything else, you know you're in trouble. for another fine Andy Garcia work. roles very nicely. However, about 45 minutes before the end of this very long movie, it turned into a mad, mad world slapstick which just insulted all the character and plot development that you as the viewer had invested.

Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer today.This TV film stops just a little short of being a masterpiece. When it ends you should rise to your feet and give it an ovation. Most definitely a courageous indictment, so exquisitely handled: otherwise it might well have been a disaster. `The Boys of St. Vincent' is most definitely one of the best TV films I have ever seen. makes it all the more more powerful. (Your skin crawls but you can't stop watching, and you truly get a sense of what these orphans are going through.) It's frightening to think that orphaned children are at the mercy of twisted institutions such as this...and sadly, always will be. An extremely memorable film that you'll only want to see once.  The ""endictment' of institutional abusers may be extended to a wider sphere than that focused on in this film. The public needs to be aware of such situations, so it can act (and vote) more responsibly. This is a superior production, with astonishing performances by the youthful cast, and headed by a powerful Henry Czerny in the lead role. should be viewed in this manner, on separate days, to allow the emotions to seep in.

Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock were absolutely hilarious, and David Alan Grier was good as well. The film is not to be taken to seriously, and although not at the caliber of Murphy favs of mine ""coming to America"" and "" beverly hills cop"", Boomerang is still a must-see for any Eddie Murphy fan. 8/10 just couldn't come off that way if she tried. There are some wonderful comic bits contributed along the way by Grace Jones, Geoffrey Holder, Tisha Campbell, and the legendary Eartha Kitt, memorable as an aging cosmetics queen with the hots for Marcus.

With Babyface producing, this is another winning production from him.Boomerang solidifies Eddie Murphy's return to the king of comedy.

It has extra scenes of dialog, stronger sex and nudity, and a much better and less choppy ending. it even conveys a similar meaning. This movie is clever, raunchy, sexy and fun. It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly deserves a lot more credit than it is receiving here. When did film lovers become such humorless prudes? (And why did Friedkin insist that the DVD be released only in a fullscreen version? Why, why, why???) could feel the sexual tension jump out from the screen. The beautifully haunting song, ""Mystic Dream,"" by Loreena McKennitt fit the dark mood perfectly.  I still don't know why I love this movie; to borrow a line from the film, it must be ""hysterical blindness."" Go see this movie with a date, and have a great time together afterwards! yet another bloody car chase). ""Jade"" is an enjoyable film, with delightfully silly twists and over-the-top violence (come on, you know you want to see Angie Everhart get run over again), and is given some class from it's cast and director, but, in the end, proves itself to be a guilty pleasure that makes one feel more guilt than pleasure. Caruso's performance is very believable.  Richard Crenna is underrated and good here too.  Angie Everhart and Donna Murphy are pleasing to look at and also give good performances in smaller roles.

But if you would like to have a taste of Dominican culture and you aren't afraid to temporarily give up your Hollywood aesthetic, this film could be for you.  And Balbuena is funny as hell. with dollars. Many years before of the birth of this movie, Luisito Martí as Balbuena, was looking for his dreams in several local TV shows in his country. At the end of every sketch something happened and he couldn't reach New York... Nueva Yol. It so important to notice that for Dominican people New York is la like the Mecca!!! because it reflects what any Dominican would want that is to come to the U.S for ""el sueño Americano"". It's a good thing this movie was made it makes all of us the Dominicans very proud and we like it a whole lot. Just make sure you watch the movie and really understand what they are saying before saying anything. to take him to the promise land ""nueva yol"" (new york city). One of the phrases to convince him to go there is: In nuevayol you find five dollar bills growing in the streets. You will find many locations and culture from The Dominican Republic and some of the places where most of the dominican colony resides in New York very well. "	7.1	0
Sonic Outlaws (1995)	"film on the legal and ethical issues that surround the work of such groups as Negativland, EBN, the Tape Beatles, and John Oswald. It follows the issues raised by Negativland's infamous single ""U2"" and is of a format (musically and visually) that one would expect from people who have a collage aesthetic in creating art to comment on the media... is replaced by just a mundane documentary.Despite the fall off I can't help but recommend this film to anyone who creates, and who likes the mash up art that runs rampant on the Internet. You may not watch it more than once but some of the questions it raises will rattle around in your brain for a long time afterward. in a career breaking lawsuit are well documented. The whole film is presenting in the style of a noisy cut up, jumping back and forth between taped telephone calls and sonic distortion to the talking heads and archive footage. Anyone interested in sampling, copyright laws, media criticism, noise, or video art should put this one on their 'to see list' "	7.4	0
Down Periscope (1996)	"the Police Academy movies.  Being a former Navy vet myself, the language made sense to me and after watching a super serious thriller like ""U-571"" recently,  Down Periscope still kept within the framework of what is acceptable and believeable within the Navy.  If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it for pure entertainment and escapism. the crew of the Stingray. The excellent cast made for an even more enjoyable movie. I don't want to get into specifics about little things that may not have been correct because that would only serve to detract from what I feel is an excellent movie to enjoy for its entertainment. So sit back, relax and ""Let's kick this pig"" just don't care. As a merchant marine myself, I found that the overall feel of the movie, while not plausible, was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes.This is a VERY funny movie, a good family film, and, particularly if your a fan, lots of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness. why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? I'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature. as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters. "	6.1	0
From the Journals of Jean Seberg (1995)	"Though not making movies ourselves, we do much the same thing when we talk about films, books, records, works of art to our friends, co-workers, family, teachers, students.I'm not a professor, but if I were, & if this movie were a paper, I'd give it an A.  It's a damn good read, & well documented.  So to speak. our big stars?  Julia Roberts, who played a hooker to become famous.  Demi Moore, who is paid to reveal her fake breasts.  And about 8200 men. Calling this film politically correct or feminist simply allows the reviewer to ignore the facts that it presents. After seeing it, the viewer will never see film the same way again. Mark Rappaport is not after  and probably doesn't believe in  some kind of absolute ""truth"", some specific answer as to why Seberg's career and life ended the way they did, indeed he is willing to place some of the blame on the actress herself; he is interested in provoking discussion and thought, and in that he succeeds entirely. and somtimes intensely cynical socio-psychological support to the idea of the collective gaze. Really rich, really worth seeing. will of her own; she is tossed about by men, and yet here she speaks the words of her male creator, Mark Rappaport - but in the history of film, its ideologies and repressions.  As these go, it is funny, informative and full of interesting and perceptive connections, but there are too many blatant distortions to actually accept it. "	7.1	0
Man of the Year (1995)	all subscribe. When shadow and makeup no longer hide the truth, and beauty moves beyond the skin, the value that remains is how much you are loved and how much you love others.  And there you have it.  Enjoy the walk and the beautiful scenery, your life will likely not change, but you will smile in the end. the best interview I have ever seen. It's really funny, witty, and crude and I almost cried to see it end. Dirk Shafer did a wonderful job bringing what had to be the most thrilling adventure in his life to the independent screen. If you ever come across this film, watch it. It's interesting and at the same time entertaining. Shafer's experiences as a Playgirl model--personally, I'd love to know just how much of the movie was based on real events; the movie is so skillfully done, it's difficult to tell.  It has a subtle, intelligent humor all its own, and is, at times, quite touching (something other mockumentaries never get near).A fine piece of movie-making, well worth watching. no less charming and attractive than Shafer is.Is he real? Those two guys are so amazing that I'd love to think they're really a couple. So I loved the movie, but it left me a little unsettled, almost as if I'd watched a movie about my own life and left wondering how much of it was true. Odd, but wonderful. 	5.9	0
Neon Bible, The (1995)	"beautiful, melancholy and sad.  Davies' films are always so full of life and this is no exception.  No idea why this film gets a bad rap - hands down, one of the greatest films of the 1990s.  It's totally unique - it comes from nowhere.  Shots, colors, textures - all perfect. Everything.  Enjoy the ride. lately that I get a lot more out of indulging in the brain-stimulating alternative pastime of reading. After all, books are, on the whole, lots better than movies. Case in point...""The Neon Bible."" I still can't stop hoping that, one day, they'll make a movie version of ""Confederacy of Dunces."" But I bet that'll be inferior to the book, too. imagery of this film and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie. But having people interact and react this way and have them being farmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark. If you want to see true southern Americana, skip this movie and see Elia Kazan's *Wild River* instead... of conveying the impact of the varied events of his childhood upon David as he reflects upon them during his train ride. I can only imagine how maddening the movie must be for those who never read the book beforehand - in short, if the movie left you feeling dissatisfied, it is still worth your while to read the book. amusement (yes, it is a joke!). Thus in the middle of the film I couldn't help it any more and started laughing aloud (watching the scene of murder with storm, lightning and bushes beating furiously in the window) and went on till the END sign. The rest of crowd joined me with relief.Film highly recommended for use in laughter therapy. "	6.2	0

Birdcage, The (1996)	"full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances. I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's. And the sight of Gene Hackman in drag is something everyone must experience. 99 times better than the original. I barely laughed, and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie. And that coming from a person who usually hates remakes. This movie gives the original ""Birdcage"" a fresh new shine and transports the story into the 90's. Well made, on all accounts, I can't think of a single criticism! Hackman in that last scene...well, I don't want to give away anything.Half of the fun of this film is the verbal repartee between the characters, especially anything between Hank Azaria, Nathan Lane or Dianne Wiest.If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to just have fun and laugh the night away.  Enjoy it!!!My rating: 4 stars to go with it. I loved the whole Nathan being the Mom dinner scene. It was just too hard not to laugh. I am little surprised by the rating of 6.5. I think people should see this film and just have a good time with it. Trust me, it's just a fun movie and it's not offensive in any way.10/10 will please anyone with a sense of humour. I pity anyone who can't enjoy it, for whatever reason- homophobia, lack of intelligence, arrogance, narrow mindedness etc. I'll admit that originals are often better, but that doesn't stop this from being a film to be enjoyed. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh, happy watching!Louis Hartshorn, age 15 "	7.0	0
Shadows (Cienie) (1988)	the father's ghost a part of the plot. Director Jerzy Kaszubowski, who also wrote the script does an excellent job of integrating disparate elements into a coherent movie, and acting is excellent all around.

Gospa (1995)	weakling in conversation with the Franciscans while talking about Medjugorje, contradicts all the bishop's public appearances and statements which are well known regarding these events. A film which abuses the name of our Lady, which does not shy away from an incorrect and insulting presentation of the local bishop...does not merit the attention of the faithful.Stella Matunina, ora pro nobis. better if it was a Croation production with Croation actors speaking the language with subtitles.  And of course a better scriptwould have been good. The other thing the film should have mentioned but did not was that the supposed apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Medjougorje has not been approved by the Catholic Church and is still under investigation. into very deep karst caves mere walking distance from where the Virgin Mary appeared to the kids. If anything, she appeared to remind the Croatian people of monstrous evil they carried out in her name by murdering and committing genocide against Croatia's Serbian and Jewish communities. That should have been a key part of the film by providing historical context. to go to Medjugorje, this film would be an good way to prepare. For anyone who has been to Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to relive the experience. For anyone curious about Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to find out the place where the Greatest Lady on earth or in heaven is still appearing. conversion of hearts, return to the faith, repentance, prayer, towards her son, Jesus. The end result is getting closer to God, experiencing his love and return of faith. Our Lady leads us to him. Go to Medjugorje, you life will never be the same.

Bad Boys (1995)	it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay. and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10 fast-paced and comedy/action thriller. The witness to a murder (Tea Leoni) of one of Smith's best friends is also along for the frantic ride that is fun, clever and highly entertaining. Watch for then-NBA star John Salley in a great cameo as an imprisoned computer hacker. A rare winner from a sometimes trivial cinematic genre. 4 stars out of 5. mind are 48 HOURS, KINDERGARTEN COP, and another Michael Bay film, ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor, even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.  KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh, but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON, I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate. and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Os Bad Boys' ('The Bad Boys') 	6.8	0
Amazing Panda Adventure, The (1995)	"panda cub and the terrific scenery. There are very few movies that depict either pandas or the beautiful Chinese panda reserves. The movie also shows the American contribution to the preservation of the pandas; the Chinese government wasn't doing much at all until American naturalists got involved in the 70's.Kids will enjoy this and you crabby adults will survive it. their scenes are some incredibly stupid dialog. Just as insulting was a big scene near the end where the children physically fend off the adult poachers. Yeah, right. In between, we get the normal plug for New Age ""mountain spirits"" and the like.OVERALL - Entertaining but the kids in her are very annoying at times.....too annoying for a second viewing. they gain maturity and tolerance for each other of course.Like I said (a million times), I was shocked by the negative reviews/ratings I would see on the web, I mean I love films about human/animal relations; this film has heart and a little humor. And I think films like this one would enlists peoples' sympathies for the Giant Panda population. way the Tibetian people are portrayed - there's no evidence of the persecution they are under. The poachers are not scary or interesting as well. I grew tired of hearing the same bars of music over and over, and I grew tired of seeing the same shots over and over! I think even kids may be frustrated with this movie. a bad shot at trying. The panda, by the way, is a convincing and cute alternating use of a real cub and a realistic animatronic puppet. The settings are also lush and captures the feel of the moments situations.Regardless its shortcomings and weaknesses, THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE is nonetheless harmlessly entertaining. Rent it for the kids.Rating: *** out of 5. "	5.8	0
Basketball Diaries, The (1995)	"memories that I thought I had forgotten. I wish every young person was made to see this movie as it takes the fun and games out of even recreational drug use. Not even the strong survive. I give it two thumbs way up and my sincere thanks to Jim Carroll for fighting off his demons to write ""The Baasketball Diaries"". to watch them throw away their basketball careers and their lives. The part where Lewis is going through withdrawal is so real and horrible. And after he goes through all that pain, he throws it away and goes straight back to the drugs. This movie is so incredible, I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay depressing.  DiCaprio is brilliant.  Arnie from What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Richard from The Beach, and Jim Carroll from the Basketball Diaries are about Leo's deepest characters.  He is an excellent actor.  The scenes that get you the most are the withdrawal scenes, and everytime he confronts his mother in the movie. This movie deserves a 10 trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as 'The Basketball diaries' delivers.The amazing performance by DiCaprio, the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in, 'The basketball diaries' deserves a 9 out of 10. be a drug-addict, they're much more explicit, more dirty, much harder... DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph, 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER, plenty of different shades.

Awfully Big Adventure, An (1995)	"is in.  Georgina Cates is the real jewel here, with a combination of naivete and boldness, along with a girlish charm which makes Stella believable as well as pathetic. Not the greatest movie made but a well done, well cast piece of work by professionals with a sense of purpose.  See it!  But not for the children. have been the best performance of his career.  Their star, ""Perhaps the best Captain Hook ever,"" is played by Alan Rickman in yet another stellar performance.  This is a consistently entertaining but very, very cynical coming of age story.  Thus, it may not be for all tastes.  Nevertheless, I recommended it highly, 8 out of 10. more or less, most of the time? When pressed, he can deliver.If you like Grant and Rickman, you can't go wrong. If you like dark stories of behind-the-scenes theatre life, this is a good 'un for you. And young Ms. Cates, married to Skeet Ulrich gives a great performance, even if she had to lie her way into the part. This movie isn't a sweet coming of age story. It's a devastating account of a young woman's loss of innocence in a cruel world.I tend to really like the movies most people find too depressing. Like the ancient Greeks I find human tragedy the greatest form of emotional catharsis. If you are the same way I recommend this film highly. This movie veers from a sharp set of character studies of provincial theatre to a weird and twisted love story with a tragic resolution.  Aside from the main story, there are two lovely support roles for Prunella Scales and Peter Firth.  The one problem in the cast is Cates, whose background was in TV sitcom and it shows. "	6.0	0
Amateur (1994)	"so aptly illustrate; these are people perpetually on the outside looking in, and yet there's something about them with which you will be able to relate, as well as sympathize .  And that's part of Hartley's magic; making you realize, that in the end we're not so different from one another, after all.  I rate this one 7/10. fitting. This is due to the acting, as every movement and expression helps to build characters and relationships. Isabelle Huppert and Martin Donovan both do this perfectly, and the impact of the ending owes a lot to them. The odd 'staging' of the film may put off those expecting a more conventional thriller but open minded viewers will be rewarded. is also a very gentle R, with almost no profanity or nudity, in its sex crazed, porn sort of way.Many other IMDb people have given plot points, and either love or hate the presentation, but anyone who was not flat out hysterical when the ""hitman"" got shot, should stick to TV sitcoms. It was a pure Monty Python worthy moment!! dialogue, the clarity, AND the ironic absurdity.  The story was not meant to be reality-driven, but limited to the raison d'etre of Thomas and the other characters: as in a dream, but not. Discovering it was a marvelous channel-surfing accident.Now I must do a search on Hal Hartley.  Check out his portfolio, so to speak.  Rating 9/10. an engagingly offbeat take on the ""crime thriller"" genre. It is also perhaps the most quietly thoughtful handling of amnesia (not as a plot trick, but as a subject) you're ever likely to see. But be warned: Hartley's refreshingly non-mainstream, detached, minimalist style takes quite some getting used to, and the ending is needlessly downbeat.     (**1/2) "	7.0	0
Apollo 13 (1995)	film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.9/10 fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic. as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.You can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable. Good job. Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece. technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that present-day film-makers would concentrate on happy situations, like this one, instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we, the movie-going public, are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!! 	7.6	1
Rob Roy (1995)	"moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation. his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films. in the history of the Cinema, and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender, and sensual. truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.Poor vs. Rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :) but i think the writers used the word ""honour"" 1 too many times.The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win.All in all just shy of a classic. "	6.9	0
Batman Forever (1995)	"is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations.  Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor. Most people tend to lump this one in the 'lousy' section, it seems, but it was one of the biggest movies of '95 and a very faithful adaption overall. Now if they'd only release the director's cut this one worth seeing as he adds a lot of humor.  I see people complaining that this one isn't as dark as the first two.  I in no way see that as a handicap.  It seemed a bit more glorious, and Batman had a very good image, but still had the flashbacks of his parents' death.Great movie. moments. There definitely is not a ""Tim Burton"" feel to the movie, outside of the psyches of the characters. The humor his the right tempo and doesn't go totally on the stupid side as in the later BATMAN AND ROBIN. It is one movie that has a great opening and a great ending, like those good old James Bond films. (not just looking like it was filmed in a basement). Batmans toys were used and seen when needed...not just talked about like in other movies.Of all the Batman movies this is the one I find myself watching the most. It also has fantastic action without seeming wimped down. It is still safe for kids 10 and older. Well worth owning. Kidman's part is a little boring but that's okay I don't really care. The special effects were great, the crew did a wonderful job and I hope they make another movie ""Batman & Robin"". For all Batman fans, this movie should be on your list. Buy it or rent it, it's worth it. I give this movie a perfect 10. "	5.4	0
Belle de jour (1967)	"Critics Circle.Interesting side notes: Bunuel himself had a shoe fetish, which helps explain the numerous shots of Deneuve's beautifully clad feet throughout the film, and the fact that every time she goes shopping, she buys shoes. He also appears in the film in a cameo as a cafe patron, and in another scene his hands are shown loading a gun. undercuts its realities by blurring them with fantasy, it is also entirely possible that the film is not actually ""about"" anything except itself. Individuals who insist on clear-cut meanings and neatly wrapped conclusions will probably loathe it--but those prepared to accept the film on its own terms will find it a fascinating experience. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer what is in the box, or do we love the mystery?The name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on 'lady of the night', since Séverine only worked in the day; everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter Séverine's feverish imagination and you might see something else. seems determined to provoke. Provoke what? Where is that need creeping from? I love to meander through ""Belle de Jour"" allowing Luis Bunuel to have his fun. He deserves it.

French passion and though she's intentionally unreachable, she's always fully aware of how to manipulate the spell she's cast over you.

Just sit back and watch the characters play out their lives, you'll very soon be engrossed by it.It was an absolute delight to watch. Not for everyone maybe but definitely for me! actors, a great rare groove soundtrack that could fit into every Tarantino production, and some really good jokes too. ""Blue in the Face"" become a minor art house classic in Europe in the nineties, and one could wonder if this movie would have been the same ten years later in the times of anti-smoking laws and campaigns. Nice independent movie. Victor Argo and precious appearances of Lou Reed, Jim Jarmusch (as Bob, in my favorite sequence of the movie), John Lurie and Madonna, to name a few. Soundtrack by David Byrne only adds to the mix.´Blue in the Face´ cynically, cleverly and ironically chronicles the life and the history of Brooklyn, NY. Watch it, it´s independent cinema at its best. but MJ Fox is really funny.  The remainder of the cast are made up of real quality actors such as Victor Argo, Harvey Keitel and Giancarlo Esposito to name a few.Overall this is a light reward for watching the slighly heavier Smoke.  Both films are good in their own way but this is the most fun to watch. a much-in-the-gutter character Michael J. Fox, which is really funny. The film also includes some curiosities about Brooklyn, and works not only as a set of vignettes but also as an account of what's typical and traditional in that neighbourhood. It has some cool moments and some touching moments, but overall it's a movie to see and not to analyse. "	6.7	0
Canadian Bacon (1995)	"stuck to developing the real themes and satire of the film, which are what make it great.Anyway, despite some weak points, this film is a brilliant satire that contains a number of parts that are utterly hilarious. It did not fulfill its full potential, but it is not too far below perfect and the good parts are really, really good. arrogant/ignorant (take your pick) stereotypes of Canada.Truly, with every scathing review stating ""This movie is a waste of time as it makes obvious stabs at Canada. That country should be insulted and the joke gets old."" No, the joke only gets better with every American reviewer who doesn't get it, pushing it that much closer to a truly inspired masterpiece. Russians and their obsession with MTV and ""what's that other one?

Moore SCORES!!! ALL the clichés and satires are perfect on both sides of the border. what makes the film funny though...it is much like the actual relationship between the countries.For Canadians...hearing John Candy respond to the capital of Canada being Ottawa was priceless...""What do you think were stupid?"", hilarious. :)Also funny...the streets of Toronto being bare!!  Toronto is the 5th largest city in North America.  Suddenly...everyone disappears...Candy will be missed!  RIP John! should do more of these stories rather than his documentaries, because people can follow his stories better than his disjointed, rambling documentaries. Viewers who are offended by this are missing the picture; it's a looks at America's anxieties and obsessions, American politics, and it has some great comedic lines and characters. Steven Wright, Dan Aykroyd, and other comedians make cameos. "	5.9	0
Casper (1995)	other films, so I have no idea whether this whole thing was a fluke or whether everything just settled in to my particular sensibility, but even outside of the emotion I think the technical aspects, the giant basement set, are enough to keep interest. And even outside of that, the acting is terrific. Cathy Moriarty is an absolute riot. 7/10 really adored! i also liked the amazing effects, that were famous at its, time. Of course now, effects from movies are like The Matrix films and LOTR, but i mainly like this film, because it tocuhes my heart in a both sad and sometimes happy, knowing, someone else is out there for you, even if you are a bit...dead. 10/10 ultimately special. The magic of Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci as well as that of director Brad Silberling, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and other producers weaves between each and every scene to eventually lift us off our feet. Above all, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Casper is my all time favourite character. Truly fantastic. You won't BOOlieve it until you see it. a movie. an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching, warm-hearted, humorous, sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note, it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family & Casper & Sleepy Hollow & see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel. 	6.1	0
Clockers (1995)	could say more about the film, but I encourage you to just see it, along with the rest of Spike's oeuvre.  He's not a perfect filmmaker, and some of his best films are marred by elements that don't work, but I feel his consistency in terms of delivering brilliance is not below most of the cinema's most celebrated auteurs. and emotional brutality. And it may have been a bit too stylized for the Saturday night drive-in set wanting a brainless shoot 'em up; but for  those interested in quality film making on a hugely important issue that also functions as an engaging who done it, Spike Lee does it up royal in this, perhaps Lee's most, accessible film. to help the mood.This is a good example of the lack of options that exist in the ghetto and, besides some very obvious preaching, it makes it's point without shouting it at the audience. The only failing is that Lee bottles it near the end, delivering a sentimental ending of hope that is unfortunately not the truth in many cases. gallows humor to psychologically deal with this culture of depravity.  What's fascinating about CLOCKERS is Lee's willingness-and guts-to present Klein, despite his prejudice, as the film's hero.  Lee understands that casual racism is simply endemic and inescapable in American culture.  What he appreciates is Klein's ability to transcend his own prejudice and finally do the right thing. in fact is grew steadily throughout the film. The images of dead bodies shown at the beginning made a strong starting point, and served as an immediate reminder that the themes dealt with in the film are occurring all the time.On a side note, I thought the resemblance of Shorty's game 'Gansta' to today's GTA: San Andreas was pretty funny. 	6.9	0
Congo (1995)	"""Congo"" is an entertaining but outdated jungle adventure movie in the style of Tarzan, with lost city, dangerous gorillas and forgotten tribe of natives. The screenplay does not develop well the relationship among Charles Travis, his apparently estranged father R.B. Travis and Dr. Karen Ross but the film works on a rainy Saturday afternoon. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Congo"" belong to that audience.  Congo and movies like it are cartoons for adults: if you don't like movies with colorful visuals, ridiculous plots and juvenile characters, you should not watch Congo.  But if you do like movies with those characteristics, then I submit that Congo is one of the best movies of that kind that I've ever seen. scene without being excited by the action, or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.So, check your ego and check your critical faculties; this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it, by my estimation, have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies. pretty decent movie. I thought the story was good. It's not Jurassic Park, but it's Michael Crichton. Congo wasn't very realistic, but neither was Jurassic Park. It was like that show ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" with intelligent gorillas and science. There was action and a plot. So I could sit and watch it. I'll give it (barely) 6 stars. by psychopathic gorillas never gets old.If you've got friends over, pop this one in and give it the MST3K treatment, you'll have a blast I'm sure.Like I said, no redeeming value to be had here but if you like watching bad movies just for the heck of it, this may be one to check out.P.S.

CRIMSON TIDE is an entertaining and challenging film that, along with films like THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and DAS BOOT, may set the high water mark (forgive the pun) for the genre.  9/10. and real. More than just a cautionary tale, this is a very human drama about who people become under extreme conditions, and how they work out problems to reach solutions, or fail to do so. If that final sentence sounds cryptic, then let it entice you to see the film so you can figure out what I mean for yourself. better films Bruckheimer ever produced. While the story was completely plot-driven and the performances a little over the top, the rivalry between Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman made this film a cut above the rest of the trash Bruckheimer tends to produce. While simple and direct, it proves to be effective in the annals of storytelling, never overindulging the viewer. very start of the film set the perfect tone. The entire film is in a way scary by making us wonder if what would happen in a situation like this, and how could the military establish proper operating procedures for it. However, the message at the end of the film re-establishes some hope. 9/10, and I love the creative title. Steve Zahn, James Gandolfini, Rick Schroeder, George Dzundza) must decide which of the all-world performers they are going to side with. The screenplay is mediocre really, but Hackman and Washington know how to overcome that and director Tony Scott keeps the pulse of his audience in high over-drive. Definitely an acceptable piece from the genre. 4 stars out of 5. 	7.3	0
Crumb (1994)	stark relief. One gets the impression that if Robert had not escaped, he'd have wound up suffering just as much as Charles and Maxon, possibly even more. This isn't easy viewing and the subjects are undeniably resistable, but it does offer a unique and enlightening glimpse into the reality of the old cliché about genius and madness walking hand-in-hand. Recommended. lives in France because its culture is `slightly less evil than the United States'.The film is embarrassingly candid about unhappy details of Crumb's life, such as his brothers' mental illness, experiments with drugs and ambivalent attitudes towards women.  Yet it is apparent that there is no misery or violence in this man  it's all on paper. (Rating: A) of the sexes, a case history of mental illness, psychotic families, whatever.  The story, and with it the film, is amazing and totally captivating.  I have watched it many times and intend to watch it many times over.  Give it a miss only if you expect some good, clean, family entertainment, but do so at your loss. the subject. I wonder why Zwigoff made no mention of Crumb's Cheap Suit Serenaders band.Crumb comments against the crass commercialism of America. And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.Crumb, the movie, is a crazy world of contradictions and well worth the ride. nearly psychotic family. Compared to the world, R. Crumb is a sexual deviant, a lunatic genius, and a perfect candidate to be taken away in a plain white van.  Compared to his family, R.

Desperado (1995)	movie that really needs no story and basically there isn't really any. All the fun characters, dialog and action sequences make you forget that there isn't really a story. The Quentin Tarantino cameo is especially entertaining and so are almost every Mexican bad guy that are all in one way or another over the top.A must see, in my opinion.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ de Almeida and Danny Trejo.Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie. smouldering just beneath the surface.The stunts and effects were first rate and extremely entertaining.Even the extras did great work.I would recommend this film to anyone who is wanting some great entertainment.Mark me don't go looking for some Oscar winning dramatic performances.But it is fun,pure unadulterated fun.Also the photography is absolutely first rate.As is the almost Kubrickesque atmosphere of the film.Ydnar yet completely Rodriguez. He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own. Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection. Grade: ***** out of ***** Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be. 	7.2	0
Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)	solidly enjoyable detective story with all the twists and turns that you could expect from that genre.  However it also benefits from a great sense of place and time that is all though the film  not merely painted on with sets or soundtrack.  A class act from Washington and others just adds to the feeling of quality. even detect the smells, too. Washington's aces, of course, as usual; makes you wonder if he'll do any more adaptations of Walter Mosley books starring Easy Rawlins. He's aided by a very good supporting cast, including Beals and Tom Sizemore (playing a heavy, surprise surprise!). Fans of Washington should watch this, but really anyone who likes film noir will approve. film 'L.A. Confidential' my problem with it was that a lot of black characters where being brutalised, without any chance to fight back. In this film they fight back. We have a black hero, someone who is as smart anyone else and in some cases smarter.I hope that one day someone will film the rest of the Easy' Rawlins books. work WWII vet(Denzel Washington)is trapped in a web of lies, backstabbing and flying lead when he agrees to look for a politician's girlfriend(Jennifer Beals). Some real good movie music by the likes of Memphis Slim, Duke Ellington, Roy Brown and Jimmy Witherspoon. Very apt support from:Tom Sizemore, Don Cheadle and Lisa Nicole Carson. One steamy sex scene scorches and redeems. males view point and this makes the film very interesting to watch. No more all-white worlds of the 40's generation. This film shows both sides of the coin, and doesn't end up with a chip on both shoulders.The film may be a tad predictable, but this should not deter you. This film is underrated and deserves your attention. Very entertaining. 	6.7	0

Multiple car scenes a cool scene on a boat, and loads and loads of gold thrown in for an exciting ride. Irons is great as the villain, as was Rickman in the first one. Truly this is one fast moving ride that will keep you well entertained throughout. rest of the action is magnificent, particularly a car ""chase"" through the streets of New York which is as unstaged as a car chase can possibly look.  The film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last.  Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an action flick that has it all. mad and/or megalomaniacal. It's also interesting that the resolution is reached on foreign ground.But the subtexts in Die Hard: With a Vengeance may be even more minor focuses than in the previous two films. Instead the focus is on the spectacle of a tightly told, thrilling action/adventure story. That's all the film needs to succeed as well as it does. a good thing. Who wants the same thing three times in a row? The plot has as many twists and turns as a snake, and the movie keeps the viewer involved. Watching Zeus and McClane bicker is amusing as well. Samuel L. Jackson pulls off the role of the ""racist black man"" very well. I would highly recommend this movie. "	7.6	1
Doom Generation, The (1995)	taking, tough as nails lead character, James Duval is Amy's naive, stoner boyfriend Jordan White, and Johnathon Schaech was Xavier Red, the crazy, dangerous, kinky, and violent source of trouble. If you have a strong stomach, and don't mind harshly sad endings, check it out, but be aware, because you might get grossed out and leave (I almost did). 9/10 moments of suspense. In fact, the film's gory and discomforting climactic scene is perhaps the artistic highlight and suggests some real filmaking talent by writer/director Gregg Araki. This is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but is worth a look for those who like a film which challenges them to react to strong imagery and who don't mind transgressive depictions. culture generation. Heck, even his colorful slang  which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms  alone is worth the effort. The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years. Check it out if you're open-minded, not quickly offended and not faint of heart! of all the product placement, but we are not supposed to give in to this commercialism.  Giving into this wasteland of over-marketed products is what Gen-X'ers say that they will not do while wearing their $60 Tommy pants and sipping on a $6.00 latte. Araki does what any brilliant director would do in this situation: make THE DOOM GENERATION. murder, drugs, sex (Highly un-erotic), ya know, the usual. The dreamy, surreal visuals are a delight, and the symbollic use of colours and light are mind-blowing if not hypnotic. Please dont be disgusted, during the first viewing, instead look between the lines, where you will find the truth. I highly recommend this film to anyone who like to ask 'why?'. 	6.0	0
Feast of July (1995)	"don't get any better than this. I caught my breath a couple of times and may have moaned! Embeth Davis and Ben Chaplin were beautiful together. Simply beautiful throughout the film.It's a very well-told story that seemed so real-to-life. It's still timely, or should I say ""timeless"". If you like historical romance and period pieces, don't miss it. It's lovely. hilarity, and he simply fell out of any serious reading list. Thoroughly recommend these two novels as they paint an authentic picture of people with real feelings and genuine jealousies and mistrust. Perhaps it is this characterisation that has been soundly transformed into a visual experience that makes `Feast of July' a thoroughly recommendable film. Near 7 out of 10. sons changing their lives forever. The film offers good performances by all, represents rural life of the time well, is artfully presented, and avoids extreme excursions giving the film a sort of perfect Disney-esque feel. Davidtz graces the screen throughout though Chaplin offers perhaps the best performance. A good watch for those in need of some easy-going romantic period drama. neurotic young peasant man, adorned with England last century background. The movie goes on swiftly, although the first part is a little slow and heavy handed by the direction. Chaplin and Davitz are good in the lead roles and the climax (the last scene, to be exact)cause a strong and impressive impact on the viewer. I give this a six. Chaplin still lights up the screen.

The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply . great music. To me, this is some of the best entertainment! The kind of entertainment that cinema was invented for and that was so successful in the 40s and 50s. It seems to me that people today just can't enjoy that kind of entertainment anymore. And that is sad! So, please, stop complaining and just enjoy for Pete's sake! (lol!) three love each other (in different ways.)All this said, it isn't the greatest movie despite some excellent acting - the movie had a weak plot and Maligant is not a very convincing villain. But, if you're bored, home sick, or just want to watch some light entertainment, by all means watch this film - just don't expect Peter Jackson quality. been told many times on film within the past century, and has almost always been presented as a tragic event in an otherwise idyllic time. Why does he insist on tarnishing this telling by citing irrelevant facts? Do not be influenced by his trash. This is simply a wonderful, new twist on an old story, and it's very well done.Enjoy! have read Thomas Malory you have some idea on how this will end. But in the case of this particular film, not completely.First Knight is not first by any means in Camelot films. But it's enjoyable enough for the fans of the leads.

Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)	A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios. A nice message for young audience that you must always think about defending the wild nature and what in real life there are more important things than money.My vote 8,2 out of 10 or between B+ and A-. the first movie in the fact that it shows willy with his family, it shows orcas in a pod, and it shows their relationship as a family. How sweet! Willy is a very sociable whale. If you want the excitement and thrilling adventure that you got in the first movie, check this one out asap. Safe for the entire family! film, yet it's really hard to spot in most scenes due to the rather seamless effect. The story is shallow, predictable, but actually quite believable, although the Jessie-Elvis brotherhood is something that can easily be removed without doing any harm to the story. As family entertainment, I at least give it a fair and easy recommendation.Rating: *** out of 5. is too young, he then runs away and then comes back. Things become eveen worse when fire spreads with the oil still, in the sea, nadean and elvis are rescued but jesse loses grip of holding onto the ladders, Willy saves him by going under the flames and bringing him to safety. I give this movie 10 out of 10. action still make superior family viewing for those with kids 10-14 range. 	5.0	0
Hackers (1995)	"some to much fame. And the soundtracks are absolutely AMAZING!! I own them and listen regularly... This should probably rate a four or five, but I can't help but ignore all critics and pronounce myself as one of the large cult following of adorers of this film. For fun value, let alone the fact that it's entertaining as hell: 8/10. It is the development of characters the build up of a plot and an exciting climax and satisfying denouement. In closing, don't expect a command line prompt or a true UNIX client on any of the systems because it just doesn't happen in movies. Instead watch the movie because its exciting, fun and a great throwback to the early 90's. OK, the soundtrack is great and it changes for the everlasting ""chliché"" of the IT Nerd.It's a movie that could surprise you, especially with the amount of bad movies being released nowadays. It's funny to see Johnny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie at the beginning of their careers as well. If you're looking for light entertainment for one evening, ... in her role. Other than that, this movie was a good movie and it shouldn't be bashed because it depicts people, technology, and life inaccurately. What movie ever does? I'm from Iowa and do you think movies depict  Iowan's lives exactly the way they are? No. But I'm not out to fertilize the lawn with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". of course, Lorraine Bracco went on to THE SOPRANOS, as the Mafia's favorite 'shrink' (with the possible exception of Billy Crystal). So, if you skip over the dated attempt to be 'cutting edge', and just sit back and enjoy the performances, HACKERS is a fun movie that can be appreciated as a 'Preview of Coming Attractions' from a remarkable cast...

All in all, Jeffrey is fun and worth an hour or so of your life. get it. It is both painful and joyful at turns watching the character navigate through a turning point in his life. I laughed, I got choked up, and then I laughed again, and again ad infinitum. This is not a ""gay"" movie. It's a character driven story that we can all identify with, if our minds and hearts are open. with the surprise cameo appearances by some of today's best actors. Patrick Stewart gives an outstanding performance as ""Sterling,"" however, it is Michael T. Weiss who steals the show! Not only does he look incredible in white spandex, but his performance is incredibly believable. Whether you are a Weiss fan or not, this movie is a must see! Lanie, NY time just star spotting!I found this so hilariously funny in some scenes, and yet full of pathos in others that I ended up laughing & crying at the same time. In the end I just had to buy it, so I can watch it as often as I want. Be broadminded, and give this film a go... it won't disappoint. I found it fun, light-hearted and adorable.  Michael Weiss is yummy as usual, Patrick Stewart adds flair and finesse, Nathan Lane gives yet another spunky fun performance, etc..

Johnny Mnemonic (1995)	the way there are some colorful characters, cool gadgets and cityscapes from Gibson's 2021, and even a smidgen of romance (but not enough to bother anyone). I mean what's the problem!?! The movie is very faithful to Gibson's vision and even asks the main character to wrestle with an ethical dilemma or two while all the action is going on... him in the role. Gibson's writing is so descriptive, that a screenplay should follow the story as literally as possible.  Ideally, I think that Johnny Mnemonic would work out as a short film, something no longer than an hour. It is a short story after all, and adding filler to extend the time certainly didn't work the first time. could tell he didn't like this movie very much. Overall, its a very interesting sci-fi flick which has its ups and downs. The upsides is the setting, the music, the vision of the future etc. etc. while the downsides are Keanu Reeve's acting and sometimes lack of interest in what happens next in the movie. I give it a 7/10. no substitute. Incidentally, many of these props appear cliched, but remember that Gibson more or less invented them; it's merely that this film appeared long after they had become standard movie fixtures.Gibson's written work has fairly sparse dialogue, and makes heavy use of precise and rather introspective visual description to convey character. Perhaps this just doesn't translate well to film. crazy preacher was so hilarious to behold. A nice and funny mirror to the numerous fundamentalistic Christians in the American society. And, of course, some nice fighting scenes, cool hi-tech equipment, and a gorgeous Dina Meyer, all packed in a futuristic ambience.

If this review peaks your interest, see it! do whenever I view this movie.  There are many quotable lines, which I enjoy reciting.  ""Judge Dredd"" is not a deeply intelligent, insightful film.  But it makes a great popcorn flick!  This upbeat, funny, nonstop entertainment is a real treat for me to watch over and over again.  My score:  8 (out of 10) even if a few actors barely get enough screen time (like Lane and Joan Chen, who plays semi-villain Ilsa), and the premise is captivating. It's too bad this film gets unduly knocked by purists and those misguidedly looking for detail realism in the genre. Judge Dredd is severely underrated on IMDb. It deserves a first look or a second chance. in a good way. I also loved the giant robot in the film.

Jury Duty (1995)	than the other jurors. Anyway as time progresses, it appears that Shore might be on to something when he tries to convince the others that the case is not as cut-and-dried as it appears. Some outstanding performers (most notably Shelley Winters, Charles Napier, Tia Carrere and Stanley Tucci) somehow found their way on this downer. 2 stars out of 5. in my life.  Who on earth spent money on this piece of junk.  Whoever they are I am sure they are regretting it.  I am not a Pauly Shore basher, I really liked Son In Law, but this movie is worthless.  Do not see it, I'd say burn it and put it out of its misery. good actress also. It's a true comedy if you think about it, stupid, funny, there's only one part of the film that I didn't find funny. I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Pauly Shore's mother runs the comedy circuit, so that's pretty funny in itself. Did he get on the big screen just by talent. You be the judge:) and Sean Whalen.So why all the negative reviews? It is such a stupid story, so stupid that it is funny. And it is Pauley Shore, doing what Pauley Shore does best, acting like a total nut and having a blast doing it. For a load of laughs and a waste of some time, Jury Duty is not a bad choice. I have to give him credit.  I mean, here is another guy whose movies were successful at the box office, but had little or nothing to show for it. If you are a fan of Pauly, I doubt you will be disappointed.  Others beware, for JURY DUTY will be a real trial to sit through.1 out of 5 	4.1	0

There is also one or two funny moments, very very well placed. Of course, to fully appreciate the movie, you must watch the directors cut, with a couple extra scenes, that actually add a lot to the plotline, and the surreality of it all. Great stuff Clive! would call entertaining, I would say the visual effects were quality work. Certainly the gore factor was quite high, but someone did an impressive job with what is called morphing.And Daniel von Bargen did an outstanding job as the very frightening Nix. I did not like the character at all, but one has to be impressed with the talent shown. "	6.1	0
Love & Human Remains (1993)	"metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (""finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond. for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone. to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember. of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over. the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes.

Mad Love (1995)	"is not solid. The flux is very fluid within this story. The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris, and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line.I actually enjoyed this, though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :. with the maniac depressive Casey that has arrived from Chicago. When she is interned in an institution, he believes that her family is unfair with the girl. But when he realizes that her mental illness is serious and dangerous, he contacts her family and they find the solution for her treatment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amor Louco"" (""Mad Love"") that might be found in a movie, opting for some different ways of illustrating their relationship. The two main characters are well portrayed, and believable. I think Barrymore and O'Donnell hold together something that may not have great elements like soundtrack, plot originality etc, because despite the fact that Drew's eyebrows really annoyed me, they both did a good job. I payed a lot more attention to the movie itself and saw that it did have delight, great acting talent and other positive notes. As well as this, the directing was fine and there were some really good shots through the characters' road trip in the movie. This is one interesting picture. A must-see! Rating: Three out of Five stars. properly portray such a mental illness without it. I also don't think a movie dealing with mental illness to this depth should be rated R. I love that this film showed that those of us with mental illness are people too. We too have feelings. I wish I'd watched it sooner rather than just assuming I'd probably not like it. "	5.3	0
Mallrats (1995)	mall law), and a bigger involvement of Jay and Bob (but not too much) make this as good, if not better than the other Kevin Smith films and quite possibly my favourite of his.Its hard to rate this film, you'll either really like it and give it a 10 or tuck into another chocolate pretzel after giving it a 1. in their own little subplot of taking on the mall police.  Again their adventures are exaggerated for humour.If you hated Clerks and Smith's other movies then you'll hate this. However if this world is one that appeals to you then you'll love this movie's reckless abandonment of reality and enjoy the adventures involved in a trip to the mall. this movie is a awfully funny experience. But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort... which is exactly what must be changed. ill let you find out how.jay and silent bob make a welcome comeback in a slightly more central role with a lot more to do. with hilarious results.i originally put 8 for this movie. but thinking about it again its a 10 and its going in my movies :) l8er days PaUl :) of himself.I liked the script and the way that the movie was paced, although at times seemed like the scenes were stretched further than they should be. The sets were good and the lighting and cinematography is good also. I don't really have any major gripes about this film, it's just that, there are better movies in Kevin Smith's series. 	7.2	0
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995)	"for everyone but, Power Rangers was never meant for adults. Simply, children. If it was for adults I'd say hell yeah, a 2 is out of remorse, but since i remember the good old days. I'm giving this movie a 5 because yes, there is much better movies, but this movie is good for its purpose. Or at least was. do back flips, yet could say their lines perfectly without sounding out of breath. Also how they replaced certain rangers with people who looked like they were picked out of a kick ball team line. But Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is a classic film I think in a sense and will be a true time capsule of 1995.10/10 quite funny to see them talking with their fists all of the time no matter the context and the different fashion back then. How often do we see teenagers dressed with their shirts tucked into their jeans with a nice brown leather belt? Ha ha ha. I thought this movie was great for a laugh. POWER RANGERS ON DVD??? WOW!!! about 9 remakes of the characters. I think that a lot of people that were children when this came out would agree here. Not to mention the film had an amazing soundtrack. All in all for a children's film i think that this film was worth the money and i suggest this movie for the newer generation of children too! TV show. Of all of these actors, only Johnson has gone on to some fame (on TV's ""Felicity""). ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" has better special effects than on the show and in ""Turbo"", and that helps alot. This is one odd picture. It ain't all that good, but it's not all that bad either. **1/2 (out of four) "	5.2	0
Moonlight and Valentino (1995)	go into too many details but this is a must watch movie and not a perfect 10 but pretty darn good. I cannot believe that this has under a 6 rating not true at all. So i have to add a few more lines. OK then vote for this movie with your heart not from a spectacularly sensational Hollywood standpoint. movie did! Elizabeth Perkins did a superb job of pulling off the part of the wife struggling to come to terms with her husbands death. The scene near the end of the movie where she finally broke down was a piece of brilliance on her behalf. Surrounded by three other popular actresses she shines through!I'm glad I watched it! 7/10. gets right into the healing process with humor, charm, and sensitivity while exploring the principal's relationships and not lingering too long on the central grief issue. Overall, an entertaining piece which, IMHO, was scored too low by IMDB.com users because of the male side of the jury. Recommended for more mature audiences... and Ebert, wake up and smell the roses. one of his first movies. I thought he was very good as well as irresistable as The Painter. But then I got into the movie and enjoyed the interaction between the women played very well by Elizabeth Perkins, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathleen Turner and Gwyneth Paltrow. Altho a female I am not usually into chick flicks but this was worth seeing. didn't quite understand if abortion was a topic here...It seemed like it during the last segment. Does anybody have a clue? That's the only thing I hate; When they don't make it all the way clear in the movie then you know they could've improved. If you want to see some good acting see this movie. Elizabeth Perkins is gorgeous! 	5.8	0
Mute Witness (1994)	"in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well-done (the ""Director"" should've asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio). This movie didn't let up since the opening scene... nerve wrecking tension comes from suggestion or chases and less from graphic violence, which one would expect from a film of that genre and plot. Apart from Alec Guinness' guest appearance, no big names, which only makes the film more attractive. I would be surprised if ""Mute Witness"" hasn't got cult status by now among the fans of the genre. the movie's pace and tone that I find it hard to believe he'd suddenly undo all his solid work in an instant. But the film's downward spiral is entirely his fault, the man wrote and directed the picture. He should have just stuck with what worked. But the first 2/3's are so much fun, it's worth recommending to thriller fans. her life and both of them will wear you out. The first I described above. The second scene, the climactic one, goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit but, overall, since it's so good at keeping our attention, then it served its purpose as entertainment. combines thriller and horror with black humor in a plot with many twists. The director Anthony Waller masterly raises tension and relieves with black humor, startling the viewer and then making him or her laugh. Unfortunately the conclusion is a little disappointing but it is worthwhile watching this wonderful little film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Testemunha Muda"" (""Mute Witness"") "	6.8	0

Net, The (1995)	The premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.To make a long review short...oops! Too late! If you enjoy Sandra Bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. You won't be disappointed. :-) the story is greatly paced and exciting enough to increase your pulse rate to rapid highs. The computer mess is the biggest fuss some viewers will have in common, including all those not used to this new style. A good shot at a modernization of mystery-suspense films, but you know exactly what to predict here. Why the new TV series? at the real Moscone Center, she desperately tries to copy all the computer files before the bad guys get her. Pretty tense, but if she had been smart, she could have gone to The San Francisco Chronicle office, which is a block down the street from the Moscone Center.But hey, maybe the Chronicle doesn't have high enough walkways out back. deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade. is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.This movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error. 	5.9	0
Nine Months (1995)	"requires thought or is deep and meaningful in any way, but if you want a giggle, then Nine Months will definitely put a smile on your face. It did mine! The only downside is perhaps having such high profile stars in not very challenging roles. Aside from this, Nine Months is a light hearted comedy that really got me laughing. forced.While things are a little light and slow in the beginning, it's in the last half hour that the writer puts a little too many comedy, most of it falling flat on its 'face'. With a cast like this, one would have expected better. I'd still say it's far more enjoyable than the likes of 'Runaway Bride' and 'Pretty Woman'. obvious.The central characters are simplistic and are black & white (she all good, he all bad). The dialog is from the day dreams of a fourteen year old.The fact that a film uses actor Hugh Grant does not make it sensitive, uplifting or funny. The fact that a film contains sex and slapstick does not make it a romantic comedy. a toy store; Julianne Moore's wheelchair plowing into a wall; etc.)Why can't there ever be a movie where someone who doesn't want children at the beginning STILL doesn't want them at the end? Why is ""I don't want to be a parent"" seen as a character flaw to be overcome, rather than a personal insight to be trusted?Lame, lame, lame. having the last laugh as the movie ended up being a mild box office success. That does not change the fact that the production is a pretty big mess from top to bottom. ""Nine Months"" goes for laughs and gets deflated very quickly. The little drama pinched in feels forced and never does become apparent. 2 stars out of 5. "	5.5	0
Party Girl (1995)	"The public library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students. It also breaks many librarian stereotypes. Librarians might even be capable of having fun -- even if they don't *usually* have sex in the romance languages section! (The best movie about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.) an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message.  This movie is FUN.  It's pretty dated, almost passe, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable.  If you want to be charmed by a 90's Breakfast at Tiffany's, attended 90's raves, or love Parker, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, don't bother. of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). Like ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. Still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone! for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem.I especially liked the Diaz character (reminded me of every single struggling DJ I've ever known). And many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it.Babaganoosh! in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way.Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good. "	6.6	0
Prophecy, The (1995)	The theological side of the story is much more interesting than angels being fluffy creatures most people believe in, and are closer to the angels described in older scripts and texts.

And his role in this film is one that epitomizes convolution. He is awesome.This film is one that should not be missed. If you don't understand everything about it the first time, watch it again and again. You'll learn something new every time. And you'll enjoy it more and more. This is one hell of a film!! wars in heaven, and now has only his duty to sustain him. Elias Koteas brings real feeling to a role that could have been cookie-cutter--the once-almost-priest who now must save the world from evil. And Viggo Mortensen, in his brief on-screen time as Lucifer, is absolutely electrifying in showing that the dark angel is indeed the most beautiful of all. franchise, with mixed results following each subsequent sequel. But it's here where it matters, a fine film that deserves far better than the bad reputation it gets from those who expected a straight out horror film. I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a go, open your mind and hope Gabriel doesn't come a wandering in. 8/10 is not exactly a given thing in a movie like this.I guess this would by many people be called a b-movie. But i think the original plot and the acting lifts this quite a few notches. So watch this for something quite unique, but please stay away from the sequels that are not worth your trouble. I rate this 6/10. 	6.5	0
Reckless (1995)	"For me, the film exploresidentity in the same ways as his earlier film, prelude to a kiss....and perhaps also explores issues related to HIV/AIDS, much like his earlier two films. This is NOT the stage play, like any film of previously written material it illustrates the directors point of view. I highly recommend this film, it's a rare delight W Stephen Dorff was in it. Even though his part was very small I was glad that it brought me to the movie in the first place. I have to say that I'm happy to see that they are turning the movie into a Broadway play with Mary Louise Parker in the cast. I think it will be a must see. you love movies, if you care about and are interested in movies as an art form, you will want to see this movie.It's incredibly funny, it's beautiful, it's strange, it's wearying. It's not for everyone, but I wouldn't want to be everyone. If you're thoughtful, intelligent, and patient, you will appreciate the superb acting, film-making, and atmosphere this film provides. slightly more absurd. For anyone who has had experience with mental health practitioners, who couldn't relate to the parade of therapists projecting their own issues onto Rachel's character, and then validating themselves for helping her? Yes, overall ""Reckless"" is a sad story but its quirky comedic elements give it enough spice to make it a satisfying if not guilty pleasure. is entirely different from anything else and that will make an indelible impression, would do well to see this film. And don't worry, the script is just fine; although it is a morality tale, it is not a morality tale with a smug or pat conclusion, as it ends, as it begins, with a weirdly satisfying sort of open-ended grace.

Safe (1995)	"it?The film doesn't offer solutions- only one of the most frightening, eerie, and numbing indictments of suburbia and the New Age that I have ever seen.  It puts its images, sets, sounds, actors into a collective vision of decay, expressed through the decline of the model suburban housewife.  See it, but don't look for answers or happy endings. to end by reiterating what is possibly the film's main strength - the presence of Julianne Moore. This truly is a captivating performance from her, and certainly one of the most astonishing I am likely ever to see. 'Safe' gives us the chance to watch this gifted actress in one of her most underrated, little seen, yet most remarkable roles. does indeed have a face and a heart.  She does indeed exist.  I think that's what Todd Haynes' message to us is.  SAFE is a cry for us to take a good, hard look at the world around us, to recognize its variety of poisons, and to make a stand to save it and to save ourselves. three of the most striking, haunting images I've seen in the past half decade in film.Someone else compared it to ""Dead Ringers"", and this is apt in many ways, though the subject matter is less perverse.  ""Safe"" shares a similar aesthetic both in the distance the director takes from the narrative and some matters of style.Recommended for the daring. thriller  as Carol doesn't know what triggers her symptoms, the audience never knows when she'll have another attack.While Haymes criticises the New Age belief that illness is psychologically-based, in Carol's case, it's impossible to separate the psychological and physical aspects of her illness. The cinematography shows her dwarfed by her environment and Haymes offers no easy solutions. ***½/***** stars. "	7.2	0

Showgirls (1995)	I recommend it? I don't know. It depends on your taste. If you're looking for a drama, go elsewhere.

It might surprise you. style as a wannabe Vegas showqueen.I think compared to a lot of films that come out that deserve a one star rating this doesn't deserve one, I found it watchable and I think there's been a kind of herd effect to say it's trash. It's just *about* trash.So right on Tarantino for coming out alone in praising it I say. so many clichés in here, but you kinda don't think about them as most of the time your wondering if you just saw what you just SAW. And the one liners are just awesome.This may not be a master piece, its far from it. but this show just how great some bad tasting movies can be the most pleasurable experience. for Elizabeth Berkley since this movie probably ruined her career. Still, I think we should all give her another chance. She's worth it. Don't all our Saved By the Bell loyalties mean anything? I want to close by saying that I am proud to own this movie in my personal video collection. It is a cult classic in the making!!! and direction and big glitzy production numbers and the recipe for a disaster of legendary proportions was the result.Sit back, have a glass of champagne, get ready to toss your fries and sit back and enjoy.

Smoke (1995)	"chance occurrences. The characters are not ""movie colorful"", but ordinary down-to-earth people brought to realization by a flawless ensemble cast. The film reaches a sublime conclusion in a tender Christmas story narrated by Keitel and supported by Tom Waits' haunting song ""Innocent When You Dream"". Everyone ends up in a better place than when they started, including myself as viewer. It gives us an opportunity for a stop and for starting rethinking issues. Therefore the small cigar shop, which appears like an island within a stormy ocean, like the antipode to the bustle environment.Sometimes some of the hurry enters the shop, but the clocks seem to tick differently there and at the end everything calms down. I like this movie. Whittaker, and all the other players  contribute some of their finest performances.The film itself ends with a ""Christmas story' which conveys more of the religious-and humanist-meaning of that holiday than a thousand scmaltzy TV specials.Watch this movie, watch it carefully. Rarely has the beauty and sublimity concealed behind the facade of quotidian existence been better conveyed in a film. is just the little things - a chat with your friend, a moment of happiness, a Christmas story told at lunch, a photo- and the feelings in life that matters. That's why maybe we feel so happy and relaxed when we watch the movie: We forget about the daily stress and want to be a part of Auggie Wren's world. new nothing of the chemistry of combustion, he did the best that he could, based upon what he knew.  Likewise, Smoke is a movie about people with limited knowledge and perspective.  Their assumptions are often wrong;  but, they do the best that they can.

Something to Talk About (1995)	character with any depth is Jamie (Brett Cullen)--very handsome, intelligent and caring--a real great performance.  A word of advice--this movie is VERY R rated.  There's tons of swearing (especially from Sedgwick) and VERY frank sexual dialogue--it is NOT for the kids (unless it's an edited for TV version).  It's an adult movie.Predictable but well-done.  Worth catching. failed when released because the exec's didn't know how to sell it to make money but none-the-less it is a classic in my book on relationships.  The choice of the title also didn't make sense because the song really has nothing to do with the movie.  Again, I think this was a marketing mistake and not the filmmakers. the heroine and wronged wife;Robert Duvall as the family patriarch; Gena Rowlands as thebeautiful and devoted spouse and mother; and Kyra Sedgwick asthe transgressive sister. Dennis Quaid as Grace's philanderinghusband is very appealing, so it's hard not to be rooting for he andGrace to reconcile. Finally, good cinematography and a portrait ofgracious Southern living make this film an enjoyable view. of the film: that Something to talk about' is the kind of film where you start out wondering how all these people are related, and end up knowing all to well'. I could not agree more, but I guess that is what you get when people start to gossip and talk!CMRS gives Something to talk about': 4 (Very Good Film) I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallström but it's a bearable one. 	5.7	0
Species (1995)	"one kept me entertained all the way through. Not the greatest movie ever made but not boring either. A fun B-movie type science fiction/horror movie, but with good actors.I'm giving it an 8, which to me means, ""liked it"", whereas a 6 to me would mean ""it was OK"". It was more than OK so I give it an 8. you don't think about it too much.Acting varies--Kingsley is TERRIBLE in his role. Michael Madsen is pretty good as part of the team as are Marg Helgenberger and (especially) Forest Whitaker. Herstridge is certainly beautiful but can't act--but the role doesn't call for acting.I'm giving it an 8. It's no classic but it moves quickly and I was never bored. or something... Who knows. Henstridge is great to look at and the above average cast give it their best shot with the lame dialogue and cliched scenes. Whitaker's empath character quickly irritates with his constant stating the bleedin' obvious, but I always get a kick out of watching Madsen, here in stereotypical tough guy mode. 'Species' is big dumb fun. of the cast is distinguished, with a very cool Michael Madsen stealing the show; the special effects are convincingly yucky; and the pacing is fast and unrelenting, with the ""search-and-destroy"" team being always only one step behind the pursued alien ""monster"". A forgettable film, but not nearly as bad as many reviews have suggested.      (**) even though they're cheap throughout - they do look fairly realistic. It's not until we get to the end and the director decides to spoil it with some abysmal CGI that the effects become a problem. But even so, Species takes its plot well and isn't too serious, and I've got to rate this as a really fun flick overall. "	5.8	0

I also to see the good guy, ""Cox,"" doing what he did late in the film, although it certainly adds life to the story.Nonetheless, it's definitely worth a look if you like a good drama and appreciate Duvall's talents. Cox and Aidean Quinn and Francis Fisher played Don Day and his wife. How could a picture like this miss? It played at only a few theaters and was quickly picked up by all the cable TV people. This film is far better than most of the movies being released today and I hope more people get to see it. this film. He is well supported by Aidan Quinn, Frances Fisher and Brian Dennehy, a cast which attracted my attention in the first place. I was interested, too, to discover that Clint Eastwood's daughter (Francesca Ruth Eastwood by Frances Fisher)played the role of Miss Fisher's daughter in the film. It's a shame the film did not have a wider distribution. it means you are one of those who have to have blood and guts,fast cars and hot chicks and action to enjoy yourself.And Iam not of that kind,thank god.All in all,this is the loveliest picture since ""Its a wonderful life"".Just pay attention and be patient and Iam sure you'll discover its true value.I give this film 10 out of 10! gut feelings, when everyone else treats him with humiliation or passes him off as a quack.

With a great cast and an amazing atmosphere throughout, this is one not to miss for fans of thrillers, film noir, sci-fi and especially the subgenre knwon as cyberbunk. 8 stars out of 10.In case you're interested in more underrated masterpieces, here's a list with some of my favorites:imdb.com/list/ls070242495 leads debate (internally, as well as verbally, a first for a Cameron movie) the implications and the possible consequences of such an action. Despite its flirtation with the mainstream, Strange Days is a film that dares to pervert the traditional course of Hollywood into a future that is worth seeing. Perhaps predictably, it made little impact at the box office. is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add.But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there. being ageless. The two most brilliant scenes are the opening sequence - the robbery in the Chinese restaurant - and the showdown down in the streets at the millenium party. Also the soundtrack (Deep Forest, Peter Gabriel, Skunk Anansia, Strange Fruit...) is one of the best I´ve ever heard, what makes ""Strange Days"" an unforgettable experience for every watcher.

Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The (Parapluies de Cherbourg, Les) (1964)	Both transport me to a world of colour, joy and heartache, yet both stay just the right side of sentimental too.Of course the plot is a little convoluted; of course the entirely sung script makes it a little jarring at first - but just sit back and let Les Parapluies do its magic. You won't regret it. I promise ;-) combine to transport you to a magical place.   I loved the fact that every word was sung, but it was not like opera at all.  After a few minutes it was as if every word is always sung and talking doesn't exist.  Catherine Deneuve was so beautiful!  I love this movie and highly recommend it. Only in France, and thank God for it. All the cast are brilliant - charming and charismatic; the production design looks like a psychedelic gingerbread house; the score is exceptional; the singing genuinely heart-felt and moving; and the whole thing is carried off with such effortless confidence and unreserved joy that it's impossible not to fall in love with it. good, the film moves quickly (90 minutes) and--quite simply--this is one of the best foreign films ever made. It's not for everybody but if you're a romantic (like me) you'll love it. But be warned--have PLENTY of tissue handy for the end. I've seen it four times and I STILL cry at the end! A definite must see. A 10+. if that's beautiful already, then what comes when the 20-year old Catherine Deneuve is in the lead role! Just WOW! Once again I don't bother explaining any of the plot, because there's no point really...but one of the saddest scenes in movie history, is the Esso-scene in this one. Watch it! if you're not too busy watching the latest Van-Damme. 	7.9	1
Tie That Binds, The (1995)	"give love to the traumatized girl. Meanwhile Leann and John begin a crime spree trying to find their daughter to take her back. ""The Tie that Binds"" is an effective low-budget thriller with a good story. The screenplay is well developed and builds tension, but unfortunately the conclusion is very poor. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Laços Diabólicos"" (""Diabolic Ties"")   I liked the way the movie made many connections of the theme like mother like daughter(also father) and the scenes when Julie used violence was quite surprising,  humorus, and actually thrilling.   The movie wasn't the greatest thriller,  yet the characters,  performances,  and scenes showed talent and I was satisfied with the rental. out than it should and ends with a particularly overdone, overextended climax. The performances are generally good and there are a few bits of imaginative camerawork, but the familiarity of the material proves to be overwhelming. The film has no personality, and most of the scenes seem to be just copies of similar events in other thrillers.   (*1/2) is!  In the final 20 minutes or so, the scriptwriters obviously suspended logical actions of the characters in favour of a more dramatic and visual finale. Too bad, because this would have been an otherwise excellent film.  Also, the inclusion of a real version of ""Mr. Flip Flop"" leading the little girl to the villain was unnecessarily cruel. ludicrous situation atop another? Stars Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine can't even scrape together the semblance of believability within this context, and both are at a loss (as the ""innocents"", Moira Kelly and Vincent Spano don't have it quite as bad, but their general lack of charisma puts them at a disadvantage regardless). Tiresome, unsubtle junk. NO STARS from **** "	5.0	0
Three Wishes (1995)	"Valley urban explosion! I thought the players were all fine and the child actors were very effective. The story dragged a bit but pacing is not everything - sometimes it is good to linger a bit and be nostalgic.  This is a good movie for thoughtful teens who can appreciate the message given about  home, hope and history. good movie for a family to watch together. I think many people can learn from this movie that we should cherish what we already have had in hand. As the saying says, happiness lies in satisfaction.And it's not a big story, so it may not have got much attention from audience. But still I would say it's a good movie. e-mailed one of my daughters and told her she too might enjoy it.. so what if it's fantasy...it was a feel good flick and I am happy I had the chance to view it..by far beats all the horror and murder movies and give hope that the world can be turned into a better place one man/woman at a time.... brilliant and makes this movie a solid 8/10. ""Be yourself"", Jack advises Tom. ""And be happy with what you have"" he adds much later in the movie. Hope and love will endure against all odds, if we allow magic into our lives. The same magic we believed in as kids. It is still there. You just have to admit it. I knew was that it was not R rated. To my great pleasure and surprise I found a gem of a movie I continually recommend to all my friends.After my brother and I watched it a few years ago you could have called us the ""blubber brothers"" as we both were overcome by the its generous wish for us all.

And that's what you sense through all of their scenes together, a meeting of minds more than a meeting of bodies.There were many who praised this movie, there were many who hated it, but love it or hate it, it holds a strange fascination which makes you remember it long after you've seen it. man or his life here, but what you will get is a story about love, madness, writing and the search for meaning.If you like what you see of Rimbaud from this movie, I would whole heartedly recommend his work to you and any and all written biographies as they will shed even more light on a truly great poet's life. acting also on behalf of the others in the cast, even when the script and the direction works against them. And it does, more than once. Maybe the plot got all confused, simply because the poetry of the poets was not taken into account.But a film gone awry can still be a wonderful experience. Frustrating, but wonderful. This one is. scat and sex and drug and rock'n'roll and get-down-and-get-dirty poets.Past that, it's the story of a great, if brief, flowering love ... the kind of love story you'd expect for people who live and breathe life in the way great alternaculture poets must.Eternity is where the sunlight mixes with the water.

To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995)	it's an admirable attempt. I think some of the reviewers on this site are a bit too harsh on this film. It is a fun bubble gum of a movie.

This movie was an education and a miserly score of 5.5 shows how unwidely entertained this membership is.See it. lives dangerously and tries to fit in, in her own special way. Swayze is the classy one, who is not allowed to forget her true nature. Wesley Snipes' role borders on caricature, but he keeps it from crossing the line between farcical and ridiculous. They all do very good work with this very risqué and difficult material. It works out. wish *I* looked that good.I suppose there was a kind of freedom in making this movie, for them, because they were not playing a character that looks like them in *real life*. I started out watching because if the novelty, ended up being invested in the characters and liking the movie.And Blythe Danner is always good, in anything she does. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo played believable drag queens, and they all did great jobs trying not to trip in their stiletto heels. Stockhard Channing was great too, as the abused wife who never gets to have any fun. The movie has a happy ending, and after the movie you find yourself accepting others for who they are. 	6.5	0

At least he handles a handgun like someone who has actually fired one. staff and provides a continuity from the first Under Siege movie.  This is all action showing Seagal as a dedicated and deadly force of protection for the train hostages and the citizens to the east.  The action moves, and some of the death blows are right out of the military manual. Watchable over and over and still exciting. I can and cannot watch.No one could possibly have a bad time watching this film (unless it's the UK version) and if you've had enough of Shane Meadows doing pretentious black and white stuff or Keira Knightely in a frock to last you a lifetime then the brainless and breathtaking action of Under Siege 2 is just what you need. Casey Ryback. No-one is more entertaining as to watch as the one man army than Segal. If you watch this film expecting an intellectual script and fine acting then you will be disappointed. But if you expect that from any all out action film I expect you are a fool. Totally over the top, totally unbelievable but a total blast. "	5.4	0
Unstrung Heroes (1995)	"family with lots of laughs early on but tears later. You could get an idea early on that it's kind of a sweet movie, but there are some uncomfortable scenes in here. There is a little bit of about everything, guaranteed to strike everyone's emotions somewhere along the way. The story stayed with me long after I first watched it. cast, all of them are really good! The last scene, when Steven is watching video tapes of his mother with his father is one of the most touching in the movie... This is one of those movies that celebrates the innocence of a child and a few adults who want to retain that innocence in a superficial and phony world. to his immediate family and his dying mother, newly confident and better equipped to cherish the remaining moments of her life.This is a special movie and I couldn't recommend it more highly. There's no sense of the maudlin where it might have gone that way, but there is great humor that will be enjoyable to a wide range of ages. family love to the screen.  While mom is very loving as well, she sadly and symbolically abandons Steven/Franz by dying and it is the weird (eccentric and harmlessly schizophrenic) uncles who support him thru it all, once again posing the question, ""Who really are the crazy (or heroes, for that matter) among us?""  I give it an 8. of the movie, he has had his bar mitzvah and feels freer in his existence.Some of the plot points may seem a little hackneyed, but Diane Keaton knows how to tell the story so that it isn't a cliché. A very good look at how the general atmosphere and zeitgeist in a certain part of American history affected one family. "	6.7	0
Unzipped (1995)	plus i really loved seeing a few of the really great style arbiters - Polly Mellen, Candy Pratts, Ingrid Sischy - on film. wish Andre Leon Talley had said more. and it was so fun to see mark morris and Sandra Bernhardt too! all in all a fabulous film for anyone in or interested in the creative and design fields. expect because Isaac is so engaging he almost convinces you that fashion can be interesting. It's a wild ride, and the only real problem is that there's too little Cindy Crawford (she doesn't turn up until about an hour or so into the film) and too much Naomi Campbell. But hey, that's what videos and fast-forward buttons were made for... with from Eartha Kitt to Miss Mellen are ridiculous! Don't see this movie only for the supermodels because while they are there, they aren't the main focus, if you want that set up go for Catwalk instead, but here lies the whimsical tale of a collection destined for greatness and a designer who is as entertaining as his is talented. that hair I would have had it cut a long time ago. Having said this, he is richer than I will ever be and he has loads of more prospects than I will ever have. So screw me and good for him. I guess I have to admit it, I really liked this film. It's a guilty pleasure. see it. The music adds much to the introspective yet whimsical tone of the film, and during the fashion show it really livens things up.  I wish there were a soundtrack available.  Put it this way, if you are interested in fashion or Mizrahi himself as a celebrity, you will like this, if neither is the case, you'll hate it. 	6.4	0

A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's.

If you watch this movie, have a big box of tissues, a big box of chocolates, and a large dose of the willing suspension of disbelief.

If you can't suspend your disbelief, skip it - you will just be irritated. those wonderful hollywood leading men of old, strong, silent, gorgeous, Cary Grant would have played this role back in the day, who would have thought to put Keanu in the same role?

Waterworld (1995)	"still far too serious for a movie like this. If he'd had the good sense to be a little more tongue-in-cheek, it would have helped a LOT. Still, it's not a bad movie by any means, and I really think all the negativity toward it is unnecessary. Enough with all the complaining... just sit back and enjoy it! 8/10 stars. imposed by the studio, so that corporate could get their investment back.

This was a tear down.Heaven's Gate wasn't awful - but just too slow. This movie isn't awful either, and neither is it slow. And if you're a motorhead - its extra fun.

It's a shame the ""experts"" (i.e. the critics who create nothing) trashed this one.

White Man's Burden (1995)	rather than a 90-minute film.  The point was to shake up the narrow-minded perspectives of two particularly bigoted groups of Americans, to kick them in the butt and make them consider that skin color isn't a factor in who you are.  Whatever else you want to say about the movie's performances or characterizations, it did its' job perfectly. whites, its a trip, just hearing that. I study psychology, and all these theories are pervasive, and they relate to science by the genetic concepts of the 20th century, i mean, eugenics and it is really wild. Anyway, this is a must see movie. You must see it. I'm mad I didn't know it existed for the last ten years. The picture displays atmospheric cinematography by Kurant and appropriate soundtrack by Howard Shore(Lord of Rings,The aviator),usual David Cronemberg's musician. The flick is well produced by Laurence Bender(Reservoir dogs,Pulp fiction). The motion picture is professionally directed by Desmond Nakano, a prestigious screenwriter. However failed in the Box-office and Nakano only directed another picture titled American pastime and again with no success. watch, we wonder how it will play out, and we're bothered by it. I analogize the film to Planet of the Apes in some ways because of its ability to make us step back and take a look at society in a different way entirely.  It is not as well done as Planet of the Apes but is worthwhile. nothing to do with colour it has to do with wealth.

If you want a classic Western flick and non-stop action, you may find it slow.  For anything more accurate you'll need to go the library; to date, this is the best film on Hickok. Ellen Barkin as Calamity Jane and David Arquette as Jack McCall. Jeff Bridges must be highlighted for special mention: his costumes and general manner look stunningly true to life when compared with real photos of that long dead gunfighter.As a piece of history, forget it. As rip-snorting entertainment, go see it, especially if you love the Western genre. Highly recommended. and pipes and the black and white flashbacks (with the camera canted just enough to suggest an off-kilter dream state) are great.

It talks about taking sides, the central character in each section tries not to take sides, but circumstances often prove such efforts futile. As with Kiril and Aleksander.In the film, all events happened before the rain, this sense of urgency, this beautiful sadness, and this inevitable tragedy. Before the Rain is my all time favourite movie. that makes this film work so powerfully. From the shattering opening section, to the startling second part, to the third story that brings it all together, this is a great film. It's been overlooked for some reason, mentioned rarely in film magazines and in best of the decade lists. But it's a phenomenal work, one that needs to be seen. circle completes.

When hate wins, innocence looses. watch this movie for a college class, and it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time.  The story is exceptional, and the directorial brilliance of its creators brings the tragedy of an entire country to life.  It contrasts the folly of war and hatred with beautiful images of the people and places that they destroy. cinematography.Finally, I could never complaint about the directors excellent work. This was his debut if I'm not wrong and that was very promising, but I suppose this was his ""Citizen Kane"" and it'll probably be impossible to make anything similar.One rarely sees anything from Macedonia.But this is not only good forMacedonian cinema, it should have won the Oscar that year.

This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies...... conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that. television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making. movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance. this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances.

I can't rant and rave about anything artistically brilliant about ""Billy Madison.""  Yet it's one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's funny, it's original, it's Sandler!  Nuff said.My score:  8 (out of 10) an excellent idea of what you are in for.If you do not enjoy Billy's sunblock song, or the bit with the penguin, then you must turn off the movie and stop being such a nag about it.But for those of us who happen to enjoy movies that are silly and stupid, this is one of the best ones out there. his father's hotel ring.  His whole odyssey is utterly hilarious from start to finish.  Especially because he has cameos and stars like Norm MacDonald, Steve Buscemi, and Chris Farley as a Penguin lover (that penguin hadn't made me laugh that hard since the pee scene in Naked Gun).  Great fun (one of the best of 1995). A++ you in a good mood are Happy Gilmore, Beavis and Butthead Do America, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and Tommy Boy.Overall, Billy Madison has a somewhat stupid sense of humor, but it does make you laugh, and it's such an entertaining movie. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now and see what all the laughing is about. here is your movie.But that aside, ""Billy Madison"" isn't just awful like many other goofball comedies of the 90's and 00's, it is very entertaining and memorable... because it just manages to really make you laugh. And it's not dumb characters making stupid mistakes (like Black Sheep for example), just very weird characters making ""What the hell was that?!"" situations. "	6.4	0

Boys on the Side (1995)	Whoopi Goldberg played it in an understated way that shows her talent, that she can handle a lot more than the over-the-top comedic roles that she is so famous for. Matthew McConaughey plays a caricature, so there is really no indication of talent there. The ending swims in poignancy, without getting (too) cloying. This film is definitely worth a look. movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack, 'Boys on the side', is a movie that we can all learn from, to try and improve not only our friendships that we have, but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel, harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side': 4 (Very Good Film) is contrived, but the interaction between the characters is definitely not. Screenwriter Don Roos writes vivid dialogue and touching scenes, and the cast plays it to the hilt. Barrymore is at her best here, Goldberg is outstanding, and Parker--while not a varied actress--does solid work. Nice direction by Herbert Ross, who hasn't been this focused in years. ***1/2 from **** think her part as the lesbian was believeable, yet she did display both strength and humor to keep you interested.

Cure, The (1995)	Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). I don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity for watching The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 out of 10.

Thus Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really counts in life; and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life.This movie is tragic  but its message is sheer inspiration. how, despite Erik's streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure.I highly recommend 'The Cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting. was getting better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried hard in this movie which I don't usually do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! Now, I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone! later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

Castle Freak (1995)	"visual style of Gordon that has given us jewels such as the previously mentioned ""Re-Animator"", and the awesome ""Dagon"".While this is not as good as those 2 movies, it still stands as one of the best horror movies of the 90's, keeping that soul that 70's & 80's horror films used to have.Very recommended for fans of the genre. 8/10 Acting is also spot on, especially Jeffrey Combs in a straight man role (for once). While it would go to far to call this a lost genre classic, it deserves to be seen by more people than probably did. If you're a genre fan, give ""Castle Freak"" a chance. It might just win you over, like it did with me. one is particularly eerie. This certainly isn't one of Stuart Gordon's best, but there is no doubt that it outshines most other Horror productions from the mid 90s. As far as I am concerned, ""Castle Freak"" doesn't reach the brilliance of ""Re-Animator"", but it is definitely a creepy, highly atmospheric and original, above average example of good 90s Horror. Recommended! about this movie's acting you need your head checked....it's a Direct-to-Video film. It was definitely a surprise to me....and most likely it'll be a surprise to you....the horror fan.I give it around a 7 1/2.....like I said it wasn't great. But damn, the movie was unique, fun, sometimes creepy and overall a welcome edition to the land of HORROR! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! your plot, I think you'd appreciate this lost treasure (definitely one of the lesser-seen Gordon horror films). I wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been, because I was half in the bag from drinking Scoresby Scotch (it's the connoisseur's Scotch)... but it kept me feeling pretty good. Thanks, Full Moon Features, for one of your better offerings. "	5.9	0
Circle of Friends (1995)	"were so embracable in their portrayals as young adults in the 50's with all the sexual taboos. The scenery is grand!I watch this movie at least once a month and have recommended it to many friend who also enjoy it. (If you are into Irish countrysides you might want to watch ""The Matchmaker"" with David O'Hara - v. good also.) these. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again & never tire of it. The performances are fresh and sincere, and the script and direction are flawless. I recommend this movie if you want to see a slice of life that is simple and frank in how we relate to each other as human beings. Saffron Burrows is perfect as the vain and beautiful Nan. Geraldine O'Rawe plays Eve. Chris O'Donnell is Jack Foley, who makes a good impression. Alan Cumming, Colin Firth and Ciaran Hinds are perfect in their supporting roles.""Circle of Friends"", while not breaking any ground, is still a good movie to watch because Pat O'Connor's direction and the ensemble acting cast. indication as to what their thoughts and motivations were.  I was particulary disappointed to see that the special circumstances surrounding their initial meeting on the first day of university (the motorcycle accident) was completely rewritten in favour of a lack-lustre introduction.  But the biggest disappointment was taking a story about friendship and turning it into a romance movie. Benny was totally miscast. That the Benny of the book is a big woman is relevant to the storyline, whereas Minnie Driver, although quite tall, can't be called big under any stretch of the imagination. The film characters seemed wooden to me in comparison with the book characters. However, if you're not into reading books, the film is worth watching. "	6.6	0

Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then you'll enjoy ""Clerks"". His brand of humour isn't for everyone. This is his first film and it's flawed, to be sure. But in my humble opinion, it's still Smith's best. of a ruling class. Especially since I rule."") or very politically incorrect antics (the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby).If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status. It has priceless dialogue, wisecracking characters and loads of swearing. What else can you ask for? and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper). In short I absolutely love this film and it gets better and better with every viewing. Rent this film as soon as possible if you haven't already. your seat. ""Clerks."" also contains many Smith trademarks including ""Star Wars"" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called ""New Jersey Trilogy.""

If you aren't a clerk, and you watch this movie, remember this: This movie is as true to form as it gets. Some people claim it to be one of the best comedies of the past decade.

Don Juan DeMarco (1995)	"thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts.Love is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful. for retirement and the best times of their lives.Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of all time. His performance is true and expressive and I just love his smile. I compare this performance to that of his character of Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". I have no problem, whatsoever, recommending this movie to everyone. and think about it.Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story.  Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6. I give it a 9 out of 10!! and a girl, this would be it.Looking at Johnny Depp might also help her in that regard.Its also a great fun family movie - which is a delicate balance to strike.4/5Disclaimer: there are about two sex scenes, which, though very discreetly and beautifully shot, featuring no vital organs, may be inappropriate for littlies, if you wish to shield them thus. in the mental hospital, while Jack gets his grove back :-) Coming back to the technical aspects of the film, I don't think there's anything lacking there.

American Legal System and sexual harrassment, and proves that sexual harrassment works on two levels.  Sex is truly power, and if you have it, you have it, and if you don't...well, you'll have to work hard to prove yourself.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but read the novel in addition to the movie. You won't regret it. rather big. Instead, sex is portrayed as the key power in the situation. Catherine Alvarez states in the film ""Sexual harassment is not about sex, it's about power. She has it, you don't"". Pretty catchy way to portray sexual harassment. Technology is later brought in as a power to...but why should I say anything more? See the film for yourself. neatly, but all in all, this is pretty good entertainment from start to finish.  The movie touches an important issues, sexual harassment in the workplace, and makes it more interesting by making the woman the aggressor and the man the victim.  Not surprisingly, I noticed that women gave this movie a higher average rating than did the men. shout out to Caroline Goodall who wisely underplays it as the wife. While the interior set design (Gary Lewis/Joseph Hodges) for the DigiCom HQ is wonderful with its 90s excess of glass meeting mirrors and open spaces.

I was saddened by the way they handled the showdown - there was MUCH more into this.As a fan of movies in that time period, I can still give em a 5/10 on it, because they tried. But times have changed. I would only watch it on free TV if you are an fan of Patsy or Denise. A cop, who was guarding Sarah at her ballet class, is murdered by Reynolds.

In addition , ¨Drop zone¨ film in which the action lovers will enjoy this ode to the skydiving sport, in spite of story deficiencies . Rating : Good , worthwhile watching . from the mediocre to the above average. And Yancy Butler is absolutely smoking. End of story.This movie is actually one of the more compulsively watchable to be released at the end of the action movie renaissance of the mid-'80s to mid-'90s. I'd watch it right now, even though I just saw it last night. My definition of a good movie. Gary Busey is also in the movie,and is his usual reliable self.Michael Jeter is also good for some laughs.and of course,for eye candy,we have Yancy Butler,who is also a fairly good actress.at least i have always thought so.when you put everything together,the movie is pretty good though not great.still, i enjoyed it for the most part.my vote for ""Drop Zone"":7/10 sequences in this movie.plot wise, the movie kinda plods along, not a whole lot of suspense but enough of a story to keep people entertained. I think its worth watching at least once, purely for the skydiving and action sequences.Also, besides being a fairly competent actress - one I can actually believe skydives -  Yancy Butler is really hot. is a thoroughly enjoyable action romp.  The action is excellent, the girls are gorgeous, and the musical score is top notch.  If you go in looking for a touching movie, don't bother.  But if you just want something to enjoy for a couple hours of visual fun that requires little mental exercise, this will do quite nicely. "	5.6	0
Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995)	"TURNS ON THE RADIO does offer, however, is a magical, mystical feel in a city where lady luck is prayed upon every second, and characters who obviously take themselves too seriously only to learn that success and fortune can fade in the flash of a lightning bolt. Other interesting and great casting mentions go to Bobcat Goldthwait and David Cross. this little diamond in the rough? The chemistry between Dylan McDermott and Nancy Travis sizzles and James LeGros makes a charming quirky sidekick. I could have lived without the Bobcat Goldthwait cameo, but when isn't that the case?Here's a good acid test: if you liked Toys, L.A. Story or the Linguini Incident then you'll like Destiny Turns on the Radio. and Allen Garfield as Vinny Vedivici, the slob producer who can make her dreams come true.It may not hit all its marks, but ""Destiny Turns on the Radio"" convinces you it doesn't have to. It is one of those irresistible movies that you don't know why you enjoy it, but can't help doing so nonetheless. Don't be shy, accept ""Destiny"". This film, with its bow to magic realism, is both amusing and surprising. Tarantino is not effective as an actor, I feel.  Apparently he is too self-conscious or, perhaps, does not rehearse.  Aside from his performance (and it is not actually bad), the performances are fine.  Just about every actor in the film does a good job. i'm no fan of Las Vegas, where the movie is set, but the little motel with its homage to film stars of the 1950's hearkens ones memory back to a time when the Strip was much less commercialized and overdone, a time when life seemed simpler, more magical, and just plain fun .. check out this little gem for yourself "	4.5	0

This ensures no distraction, and makes sure that we are put firmly within our character's plight.On the whole, this is one of the best films that Polanski ever made. Considering his prowess as a filmmaker; that is really saying something and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies. of their characters. All three roles were depicted as intensely real. I enjoyed this thriller from the moment it began to the very end. You are immediately engaged in her reality, rather than experiencing a slow build up seen with most movies. Very satisfying because no character was one-sided, but they were multi-dimensional, with each having a unique history. Bravo! a strong resemblance with the brutal tortures during Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. It is not filmed in that country, but they use Chilean money, they eat Chilean bread and they mention Tavelli, a popular café in Santiago. Beautiful music. Schubert's Death and the Maiden, is played throughout the movie.A great film to view with people who enjoy having discussions after.Enjoy! unnatural that they are unable to see their extent. They cannot think clearly and so their thinking structure changes and they begin to take completely absurd things into consideration. Every person reacts a little differently to the situation. I love this, and that's why I give this movie the best rating. I couldn't find any flaws in the movie, actually. The film is an X ray into secret, open wounds. We're never sure what happens in Sigourney's mind, but we're aware that her pain and her anger are real. We are unable to take sides, we're too afraid. We want for the ordeal to end and yet, we're glued to the discomfort and uncertainty. Recommended for masochists and film lovers. 	7.3	0
Dolores Claiborne (1995)	"critics missed how good it was. I notice Maltin's book now raves over the film, giving it 3 1/2 stars, the same rating he gives to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. The violence here is more psychological than bloody, but DOLORES is every bit as good a thriller as LAMBS, and Bates, quite frankly, can act circles around Jodie Foster. David Strathairn's Joe St. George surely deserves a high place in the canon of Stephen King movie villains. Strathairn makes him as bad as can be, and yet there's occasionally a playful touch that *almost* makes us see why Dolores married him in the first place.In the end, a rather underrated film, successful on many levels. 8.5. out of 10. mannerisms fit perfectly to build her terribly tormented character.That's what good story-telling is all about: even if you already know the plot from A to Z, you just want to see once again the way it unfolds, like a good scary fairy tale. ""Dolores Claiborne"" is not without faults, but it's certainly worth your time, and even more than once. a victim than even she knows. Christopher Plummer is excellent as the detective.Taylor Hackford's direction is absolutely brilliant - as is the use of color saturation and creative scene blending and transition to move seamlessly between present and past.This is an outstanding film - well worth the Oscar nominations it received (as well as those it did not!). HIghest rating! are Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kathy Bates. They did an amazing job of portraying a estranged mother and daughter too haunted by past events to once again come together. The movie is a must see for everyone and it helps greatly to read the book before seeing the movie. I believe this movie should have received more than one award. "	7.4	0

Eat Drink Man Woman (Yin shi nan nu) (1994)	the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life.  And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it. By the end, you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 10/10. executive, but only because time-honoured attitudes debarred her, as a woman, from following in her father's footsteps as a cook.Unlike the classic Hollywood film, there is little out-and-out conflict in this movie, which seems to be based more on the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang, mutually dependent opposites. But whatever its underlying cinematic rationale, it is a masterpiece. effortlessly with a superior sense of rhythm; it's always pleasing, even when the content feels overly familiar.  He demonstrates a healthy respect for his characters (with the exception of a divorcee whose bitter views of marriage don't stop her from pursuing Lung)--everyone gets to play out their lives with dignity and happiness and without an ounce of filmmaker moralizing. However, the old values still need to be cherished and passed on to the next generation since they are the foundations which give sense and meaning to a life which tends to assimilate happiness to disposable items and economic success. In doing so, Chu and her daughters get reconciled, as well as their traditional background comes to terms with modernity. is the obnoxious older lady that has set her sights on Dad! How the many relationships are resolved is masterful and provided me with a good laugh!

Character development, secrets, and inner truths are revealed slowly and carefully and in non-linear fashion by Egoyan's delicate director's hand.  The ""exotic"" flavored yet haunting musical score is an added bonus.  Worth a look if you are in the right mood and know what to expect from Egoyan. go. Some of the dialogue seems poetic, cynical and truthful all at the same time. A film that you really need to watch to the end before you really feel you understand it's puzzle (and even then there seems to be something just out of grasp this viewing). A moving portrait of life that will linger in your mind afterwards. (difficult as that may be at times) in the scenes shot in the club. The really interesting stuff occurs at the margins of the film, as the gulf separating the storylines begin to vanish, and the final scene gives you the keystone to a horrifying clear vision of a sadness so overwhelming that no one in the film escapes unscathed. paying for it. Finally, the frequent appearance of parrots and their uncharacteristic silence reflects the characters' inability to communicate and overcome the losses of their past.  I've really grown to admire this film and Egoyan's work in general.  In 'Exotica' he creates a work of complex symmetry and interconnecting symbols while also conveying an atmosphere of lyrical intensity.  It's also about the danger in leaping to conclusions -  the viewer is often tempted to make a judgement about what he or she sees, and that judgement is often both wrong and unfair.  If this all sounds like homework, be assured that the movie is also a lot of fun: it's sexy and interesting and inspired. "	7.1	0
Exit to Eden (1994)	film.  I thought the contrast of the interplay between Mercurio and Delaney and between Ackroyd, O'Donnell and the crooks was expertly handled.

It may not be Olivier doing Hamlet, but it beats Shatner playing Othello.  Recommended for Dana Delaney and Rosie fans with the obligatory Hector Elizando appearance though he's done much better elsewhere. and Sheila Kingston also travel to Eden pursuing supercriminals Nina and Omar, who are also on Eden to kill Elliot and retrieve the pictures he has taken of them.  This is a well made movie with some laughs, sex, and bubbly romance.Exit to Eden is Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, mild language, brief gore, and some violence. screen that had been in my head reading the book.  I guess if it had been passed off as other than a comedy, it would have to be labeled pornography.  The good parts of the movie show that this could have been a great project if they had attempted to stay close to the spirit of the novel. cast is good except the above duo. Dana Delany is great as the Mistress of a pleasure island; she takes a chance and shows her sexy side of herself as well as full body nudity.

More Ed Woods , please! about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there; and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With ""Ed Wood"", I'm not always interested in following the story, but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there. his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough (or not) ""Ed Wood"" died at the box office but as it happens more often than not, ""Ed Wood"" is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time. Yes, that business of time never fails. Greatness prevails. much the movie's legitimacy would have been lessened if it was in color. I must assure you that, no matter how offbeat and strange it looks, this film is an absolute classic that begs to be seen. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has a wicked sense of humor and is sure to have you in stitches. pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this  that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.

And then of course Meg Ryan is always the perfect pick for these kinds of films. What can I say other than opposites really do attract in this fun-loving completely romantic movie. This is definitely a classic movie in my mind and a must buy, not rent. in my opinion. His entire persona here makes it difficult to believe that Kline isn't really French. He must have had a fantastic language coach! Also, there is great on screen chemistry between Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline.It's a delightful, light hearted film, a good date movie, and not necessarily just a chick flick as my husband enjoyed it too. 	6.6	0

It would be a bit too frightening for small children.Even though I knew I was being strongly manipulated by the inevitable happy ending, I could not help myself from bursting into tears.  I don't think I've seen this kid do one false thing in front of a camera.  He plays or embodies youthful promise and that  in-between adolescence and adulthood stage like no other actor I've seen.  The same expressiveness is in ""King of the Hill"" -- astonishing really.  Oh yeah, and the dog is great too! as the resourceful Angus. Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers are seen as the parents.

Hideaway (1995)	"of the shining factors in this movie.  What with his penetrating stare and spooky, well-spoken accent he made, to me, the perfect killer.  A round of applause for the young man, if you please.Personally, I see Hideaway as a movie that should be a big hit with the gothic community, and I shall stand by my word regardless... Otherwise, this is an entertaining horror thriller, with trippy ""tunnel vision"" (literally) sequences, flashes of dark humor and the usual good performance by Jeff Goldblum. The ""good vs. evil"" climax does come off a bit cheesy, but that doesn't happen because the effects are not good; it happens because of the way in which they are employed.

I mean they dont even get the characters right...Regina (Silverstone) is supposed to be a nine year old ""crippled"" (as she defines herself in the book). Changing her character takes away from the plot of the story! It's a shame that they waste Koontz's amazing talent on movie's like these. earlier Brett Leonard's horror film ""The Dead Pit""(1989-check out my comment of it!)and this director is incredibly overlooked and talented.""Hideawy"" is excellent-fast-paced,violent and really dark.The visuals(especially the vision of Hell)are really impressive,and Jeremy Sisto as a satanic killer Vassago is outstanding-he is pure evil!Great soundtrack bu such industrial/metal bands like KMFDM,Fear Factory,Godflesh(""Nihil""-I love this song!)and Front Line Assembly.My absolute recommendation. some scenes that I preferred to watch through half-closed fingers, but for the most part, it was truly a wonderful film.

Only the acting from the humans and a few of the sometimes out-of-place scenes hurt the movie just a tad, but not enough to stop me from giving this underrated movie the recommendation it truly deserves. do not weep watching a movie, but this dog Fluke made me shed tears from beginning to the (somewhat bitter) end. The story is completely unbelievable, so what!, but very funny all the way. Can't understand what those people's hearts are made of that do not like a story like this. I'd rather watch Fluke ten times than Rambo once! life, so much the better. This is a movie for people of all ages. The animal wranglers did an outstanding job, ditto the actors. Have not seen the dog who played Fluke before; wonder if he is still in the acting business.Would be glad to see more films of similar ilk, but I have not run across many like this. being left alone, and move on.... The scene by the Gravestone, when she realises just who Fluke is, as he scrapes away the snow to reveal his name, is one of the most moving pieces of film I've ever seen!! But at the VERY end, something nice happens...he meets his old friend again!!!! This film is just SOOOOOOO BRILLIANT!!!!Gary Edwards saddest movies I've seen, just because of when the dogs are in trouble, and also when they're lonely or hurt.  I really like how the story is about a dog who is transformed into a human to find his family; it was pretty cool.  I would reccommend a big box of tissues for this movie-just to be prepared. 	6.7	0
Farinelli: il castrato (1994)	"rather, the people with the money to afford the (by our standards) enormous ticket prices had simply lost interest.One commentator here is skeptical about many ""period"" details. And rightly: for starters, that's not the way boys were castrated, but you don't need to know the truth. Relax, just enjoy the music and the costumes and the actors chewing the scenery. known as disinterested in sex, thus I have no idea why the sex scenes in the film were included. True, there WERE castrati who did engage in pleasures of the flesh, but Farinelli was NOT one of them, or at least there are no historical records suggesting so.All that aside, this movie was a lavishly done production and a must-see! a lot of other aspects to explore. We also get to see the obligatory scenes of audiences being mesmerized by opera, as if they were some island natives and not opera house regulars. Nevertheless, being a high budget movie, it has great costumes and beautiful scenery. Most of all you get the chance to explore the divine music of Haendel. and a sadness that is truly stunningly and sensitively achieved whilst adding to the story line. I love this film and cannot possibly recommend it enough. Any lover of Early Music should revel in it, but it has been lifted out of the ordinary and into the universal and sublime by that one small realization. Superlatives cannot do it justice. well-researched and meticulously designed. The combination real-and-computer-created vocal work is fascinating in its etherial timbre and in its negotiation of Handelean melismas, embellishments and assorted ornamentation. Likewise, the baroque pit orchestra and period opera house decor is strikingly detailed.What a pity ""Farinelli"" fails in its main opportunity: to convey a simple, heart-felt story of one of history's most celebrated singers.

Gordy (1995)	"a feel good movie with a happy ending. If you need profanity, nudity, sex,violence or rude and disrespectful kids in a movie in order to like it then skip Gordy. It has none of that. The only dirt in this movie is actual dirt on the pigs. Gordy is a good movie for those who like clean, lighthearted family entertainment. Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale (It was so unspeakably awful, I couldn't last 3 minutes after it. It's a hobo's version of Gordy) or one of South Park's top 10 worst episodes where they ripped off the whole plot by making 4 retarded idiots with annoying voices saving baby cows from a slaugther house (That too, is a hobo's Gordy). about it. My kids don't really like Babe, I assume, because it goes at a slower pace and is not so flashy, but I'm sure that once they are older, they will enjoy it much more than Gordy. Gordy just has no substance. If you are looking for something that you can enjoy with your children, this is not it! which country music singer Doug Stone plays her father. Later they make friends with a wealthy family which Gordy saves a wealthy son from the pool.That's a fun movie to watch.Plus country music singers like Christy Lane, Moe Brandy, Roy Clark, and Tom Lester of ""Green Acres"" fame appears in this movie as well.I give it 10 out of 10. the animals never looked like they were talking, the plot was completely uninvolving, and the acting was mediocre at best. One nice thing was finding out the reason that Tom Lester (Eb from ""Green Acres"") never got anywhere with his career. He's a one-note performer. At least Eb had some decent writers. Now my daughter is happily watching ""The Aristocats"". "	3.9	0
Gumby: The Movie (1995)	"now even at seven. I would highly recommend it to anyone with small children. I was a teen, I came up with what I thought could only be the best idea in the world.  A ""Terminator II"" parody with the cast of ""Gumby"" gone bad. Art Clokey and I must be psychic friends or something because here we are with the Gumby movie, and it's Evil Robot Gumby.Yes.  Oh yes.This movie rules. most of them are alright. I don't know, maybe I have now seen it too many times. However, since I liked the film more during previous viewings, and enjoyed a bit of it this time, I have to give it credit, and do recommend it for stop-motion fans of all ages. You just might not want to expect a masterpiece. utterly psychedelic claymation of the last few minutes of the film, because it really is beautifully done. If you expect Aardman Animation or something modern, you should adjust my rating down a few points -- this probably isn't for you. But if you remember Gumby and would like just another short while with him and his friends, here's your chance. of said face, and the fact that said teardrop is a professor of some kind. I can even accept the fact that everyone in the world looks normal, except for Gumby and his pals, who are highly stylized blocks of primary colors.

The film also highlights the conflict within the african american/black community towards police and police brutality and how it is hard for even them to sometimes accept black police officers.

Hoop Dreams (1994)	shows you exactly how real life differs from the garbage that passes for representation of youth on TV and in film today.I really can't say enough about the need for more films like this, the fact that the Academy Awards were changed because of the strength of this film goes some way to showing you exactly how powerful it is. no license, we'd have 350-hour documentaries.At one moment near the end, William's coach says goodbye to him and as he walks out his coach mentions that that's the system: one goes out, another comes in. It feels like we're saying bye to a member of the family. This is a life-affirming experience, a family that should be visited again. 10/10 parties when it comes to the well being of inner city kids, who just happen to be good basketball players. Considering the state of pro basketball now, this kind of shows how the downward cycle of basketball was seeking lower standards. Sometimes funny, often times sad and poignant, this film is easily one of the best documentaries of all time. By examining not only the players but also their families and environments, we are given a clearer view of their aspirations and motivations, what they plan to achieve and what they wish to avoid.    I will not summarize or elaborate further.  If you have not seen this movie, put it on the short list.  9/10. have wept at your hardships, and screamed joyously at your triumphs.

Heavenly Creatures (1994)	"the Feebles"") are mainstream accessible--in ways that Lynch, especially, could barely consider (although ""The Frighteners"" was painfully overlooked by the US market)--makes me wish that he'd try his hand at more mainstream material.Imagine what a Peter Jackson ""Titanic"" would have been like...and compare that to what a James Cameron ""Heavenly Creatures"" would have been like and you get my point. it.The direction is great and it delivers a complex story in a colourful and fanciful manner, but the main praise should go to the two lead actresses who deal with really difficult characters and do so in a confident and believable manner  even if the material means that many of us will want to find what they did abhorrent. classic thriller with cheap tricks, Peter Jackson gets you inside the twisted minds of these two girls, and whether you hate them in the end or not, you completely understand why these girls did what they did...and that it was doomed from the start. Kate Winslet is just brilliant. WHY wasn't she given every award under the sun for this?!?!??! By the end of the film, they do the unthinkable.Kate Winslet is superb as Juliet. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Peter Jackson does a masterful job of capturing the essence of 1950s religious repression in New Zealand. It could be England or American in the 1950s. Heavenly Creatures will appeal to anyone who enjoys psychological twists and turns. play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction , as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful , haunting , thoughtful and incisive .

But the film was ignored.Above all, however, Gary Oldman's performance ranked among the best in the world - but it, too, was ignored.Give the film another chance.  It deserves FAR more than it GOT. It was, simply, beautiful... blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament. It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.  And it's but one of the more astounding moments from an astounding motion picture that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10. the truth is (even though NO ONE KNOWS in this case) that they are blinded to the rest. The director is a Beethoven fanatic, and I found this movie to be a loving portrayal. Gary Oldman was absolutely fantastic! He learned to play the piano (spent months doing it) in order to be authentic. Thumbs WAY up on this one. moment when Beethoven first plays the 'Moonlight Sonata', and the breathtaking 'Ode to Joy' sequence, framed against an unhappy memory from Beethoven's youth, which culminates in a moment of supreme cinematic glory, one of the most beautiful images this reviewer has ever seen. Vivid production design by Jirí Hlupý, expansive scope photography by Peter Suschitzky; filmed on location in Prague. and will remain with me forever. The movie is incredible and the Academy awards should collectively hang their heads in shame for being so dull not to see this movie as worthy of even being nominated due to its silly rules, or for never recognising Oldman then or since for the wonderful and great English actor that he truly is. 	7.5	1
Hunted, The (1995)	"almost an entirely Chinese cast). If you're in the mood for an fun, entertaining, semi-intelligent B-action flick, I whole-heartedly recommend this one. Oddly enough, the writer of ""Pretty Woman"" wrote and directed this flick, which may explain why my wife liked it, too. Of course, the same guy did a flick called ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"". experience which shocked a lot of us and the crowd I was with, were prepared for brutal action. The Hunted works as a Ninja actioner and is generally better polished than almost anything made in the 80's. It's slick, brutal and overall a fast paced actioner which in the end, is all we ask for.* * * out of 4-(Good) middle of a war. The sword-fight choreography is decent and very realistic. The Japanese actors put on a splendid show. This a gripping, colorful and highly satisfying film that will never have you bored at any point. I find it quite under-rated because it is quite well developed despite its obscurity. This is something I would recommend to any viewer. ""How far can a code of honor go?"". What struck me in this movie is the excellent use of the Japanese scenery i.c. Tokyo, the bullit-trains, the temples, the ninja way of life...The score is by the heart beat drummers Kodo. A great action packed movie with a lot of tension in a very beautiful package! Don't lose your head! as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts.

I.Q. (1994)	"between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. How they stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart.

My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance, if you yourself can't participate in one. It's a good 'un! as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.I highly recommend this movie.  It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here.  Watch it and enjoy! Kurt and Boris letting all the research animals free!Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: ""Don't let your brain interfere with your heart"". Ed Walters: ""When was the last time he said ""Wahoo""""? Catherine Boyd: ""Well I'm sure I don't know"". This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape and every once and awhile I will watch it again. The supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry (""agae"", ""a total pygmy package""!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as ""Greek chorus"" - ""but time doesn't exist""), Durning (""something we can launch from NJ""), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins' boss and co-worker at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies have Eisenhower??).Don't miss this overlooked treasure.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)	"all of these deep, important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters, haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue. Gripping from start to finish, you will be enamoured at the vampire-world opened up to you; and by the end, you are left wondering what choice you would have made, given the one that Lestat never had... them that is close, is the kill. Killing is highly ""erotic"" to vampires. However, this too is really asexual, and so again, gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this, which apparently came across as homo-eroticism, were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different, how non-human, that vampires are. refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix - originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title - who died of a drugs overdose during pre-production; his role was taken by Christian Slater. Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002). the book, I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel, here's a clue that might prove useful in the future: the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Don't waste your time complaining about something that is understood. flair for dark style (in most of his other films too), and more importantly produces a epic tale with sturdy direction.

If these superfluous scenes had been cut, perhaps there would have been time to go deeper into Jefferson's politics, which after all is why the man is remembered today. the revolution.  The movie even seems soft on the ancienne regime, which over time killed a lot more people than the Terror.These muted investigations of freedom in the film move very slowly, but still hold interest--they are thoughtful, probing, and, to a degree, don't pass simplistic judgements on people.  Cerebral film, but then Jefferson was a cerebral guy! being. Paltrow is very persuasive as Patsy, and many of the rest of the cast present excellent (or well-proportioned) characterizations. Except for some trivial inaccuracies, this is a richly textured reconstruction of history as it may very well have occurred. I find that I look in on it just about every time it pops up on cable--and I'm always rewarded. the film are well enough executed, while the creators, Prawer Jhabvala and Ivory, do provide us with a little seasoned food for the intellect, both here and elsewhere.""Jefferson in Paris"" does contain a few speech anachronisms but otherwise seems to have found the flavour of the period. Altogether, not an exceptional film, but one which has much to recommend it. "	5.7	0
Junior (1994)	"ultimate ""female"" experience. The contrast keeps the comedy rolling, while the characters carry the film.It is hardly a profound film, although it is intelligently written. The issues raised rely on simple male vs. female differences and the contrast of Schwarzenegger's image with this role is used to full effect. It's an enjoyable film with strong performances by Thompson and DeVito. underused--she doesn't get any good funny scenes till the end.  Also, where else will you see Arnie in a dress?It's a one joke film.  Is it a good film?  No.  Do I like it?  Very much. Call it a guilty favorite.One complaint--at 2 hours it's too long.  Couldn't it have been trimmed a little? the boo-boos are meant that way... Anyway, if you don't mind the occasional sexist cliche, and if you want to see Mister (Hollywood) Universe in the charming role of a peaceable pregnant researcher, this movie packs two hours of hearty laughter. In the whole movie, Arnold sends flying only one man, once - the only bad guy in the movie. and downs of being pregnant, but no matter how outlandish the premise is, there is no denying that the movie is definitely pretty charming. It was great to see Schwarzeneggger and Danny DeVito together again after their classic work together in Twins several years earlier. Once again, they have come together and brought us a great piece of family entertainment.  typical maternal figure under large doses of hormones and an experimental medication provides lots of opportunity for comedy and some real poignant vignettes. Frank Langella's character as dean of the university sponsoring the research is a bit over-done and becomes annoying. Emma Thompson plays lonely research scientist attracted to Arnold who becomes much more involved than she originally intended. "	4.6	0

Compared to another movie psycho, the deliciously evil Hannibal Lecter, Harris' Sullivan is simply annoying.""Just Cause"" doesn't offer anything radically new in this movie genre, but it is a solid, mostly well-acted film who should deliver enough thrills and excitement to satisfy most viewers.

He comes to realize that he is more than what people may think of him. He gains courage and self respect. Now, even if that is done in a pop culture/bubble gum sort of way, it should be respected.Plus Kate Winslet looks just as hot now as she did ten years ago. not only for kids, but for adults, too. The point isn't the historical drama, although that's a lot of fun even if it's more like a medieval section of Disney World than 6th Century England. The point, at least in this particular instantiation of A Connecticut Yankee, is the removal of conceptual/environmental ruts that get in the way of self-actualization. for this live action Disney fantasy, but one that doesn't suggest that it's generally considered abysmal, I'm sure many kids would enjoy it, and maybe their parents as well. However, if you don't fall into either of those categories, I suggest you skip this movie and watch a more widely appealing fantasy film (if you're into that kind of thing). Very cute. Warm. "	4.8	0
Kiss of Death (1995)	"thought NYPD Blue was very overrated, except for Dennis Franz. However, I think that David Caruso is a much better movie actor than he gets credit for. This one is definitely worth seeing. It is not a stupid high-action movie like Armageddon. However, it does have some very intense and well staged scenes that will keep action movie fans happy. hammy.  His character is full of ticks and eccentricities that at the end of the day that's all Cage has to do.Overall this is a solid thriller with no surprises.  Caruso fans (like me) will like it regardless because it's Caruso doing his usual role.  But others may not be so easily made to overlook the weaknesses. That is the strongest look I had seen since Stallone did ""First Blood, Part II"". Cage is a physical bull and it's impressive. I wouldn't have recognized him if I hadn't seen the trailer with his name on it beforehand. If you never saw this, see it. For no other reason than to be scared of Nic Cage. I was. didnt get much press when released (probably due to Caruso's controversial exit from NYPD Blue) this film builds the suspense and keeps you involved and interested.Caruso, the Cagney for the 90s, plays his part great with a tension you can feel. All the other roles are played well in this sleeper movie.. Well recommended Kiss of Death rates a 8 Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go.There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him.This movie was really very enjoyable. "	5.9	0
Little Women (1994)	"more than it could have been.It's a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in it's portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to it's own story and portrayal of people and their lives. It's beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film. as Laurie was everything the ""boy next door"" should be: handsome, kind, and charming. His chemistry with Winona Ryder was considerable, and made their friendship very believable. Susan Sarandon played a wonderful Marmee, supportive and loving towards her girls.Another thing I would recommend is the soundtrack to this movie, composed by Thomas Newman, which has some gorgeous music on it.10/10 be very bittersweet, but it is a joyful film, and says a lot about people and our emotions and our lives and yet is not confrontational in the least. It pulled out themes and messages which are often looked over out of one of the world's most famous books and made a lasting work of art that touches your heart. usual)I usually don't like remakes of any movie, but this one was wonderful!!!

No other film makes me tear up or cry as much for its brutal honesty, it's uncliched tenderness, and heartfelt truth about those ultimately human truths- love, kindness, and the magic of believing.  Rarely does a film so positively move one's heart.  Seek this film out.  Go now. is worth watching.Side note-little boys might not find the film engaging. It is kind of chick-flick for the tween set. That doesn't mean it's totally male-unfriendly. Fathers of daughters will be hard-pressed to avoid shedding a tear or two.If you have a tween daughter, save some rental money and just buy it! She's going to watch it over and over. Sarah is imaginative and smart. Livinia doesn't like Sarah because she is a threat to her popularity.

I recommend both the book and the movie. she literally burns down their outdoor shower from her body heat and then runs naked across the plain only to be scooped up and carried away on horseback by a bandit is one of the sexiest moments ever put on film.This movie is not for everyone, but if you enjoy erotic (but NOT pornographic) fantasy, try ""Like Water for Chocolate""!

This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me. very good scenes. - The movie is a kick in the nuts to ""civilized life"" and state affairs. - The anarchistic attitude. - The character Tristan Ludlow. - The character William Ludlow. - The emotional ride.Reasons to NOT see the movie: - You will be called a pathetic romantic if you like it. And you will most probably like it... In this movie he was rustic, yet thoughtful.  He was strong and vulnerable.  He had a great love for family(especially his father) and for a woman he knew should not be his. This film a true epic with history, talent, superior cinematography,  and most of all(and what many movies of today lack)..  closure. Watch and wonder It is rare when watching a movie, you cannot pick the ending. The ending to this movie was so amazing, and the fact that it wasn't obvious what was going to happen made this movie more enjoyable.James Horner is a master. Just like he did with Titanic, the score for Legends of the Fall took the movie to another level. you've watched the film to its fullest and there's no more stories left untold, that's what I look for in a good film. Even though the story was tragic, it was a story of love, loyalty and family. I give it a 9/10...if you haven't seen this movie yet...SEE IT! You'll love it, even if you don't fancy Brad Pitt.

Major Payne (1995)	"although I was in the R.A.F cadets at school, and have a brother in the British army (a Major, no less!!!) I have not been through the 'boot camp experience', yet still found the movie to be very funny.  Bottom line though, I can see it's not for everyone, so use your discretion.8/10 for me ? /10 for you voice.  Wayans delivers his dialogue in a manner almost reminiscent TV's The Nanny - nasal and grating.  However, he performs with such dry sarcasm and a fantastic permanent grimace that he is a real stand-out, and ultimately the film probably wouldn't work as well with another actor in the role. For light entertainment value, 7/10 for Major Payne. team scene at the end brought back fond memories (yup, we really did cool drills like that)...Damon Wayans is just...damn, he's funny. The one-liners he delivers, and the way he delivers them, is too much. I'd love to see the blooper reel. If the movie was that funny, the bloopers would probably make you pee on yourself.It's funny, funny, funny. scenes that are side splitting. His character's militaristic interaction with the young kids makes for some funny scenes. this was a great movie. I laughed all the way through from start to finish. The shooting of the bogyman through the closet door was priceless. The story of the ""Little Engine That Could"" was great. I hope that a sequel will be made where they have the blind guy and his Seeing Eye dog. That will be funny stuff. "	6.2	0
Little Odessa (1994)	also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too. haunting way of showing the true face and consequences of brutal violence. Intensively and artistically this film displays a chaotic & desperate family, a destiny very honest and very haunting. Cinematography is stunning, as is the environment, which very well defines the fundamental characteristics of this film, cold, naked, intense & raw. Great debut by the very promising James Gray. gives one of his very best performances in years. As for Edward Furlong and Tim Roth, both of whom can be very good or very bad, lets just say they haven't been this good before or since. Gray's command over such aspects of the film as pacing and visual style is impressive. The whole thing builds to a stunning climax. tragedy among the unhip and uncool.  Torn by illness and the return of a prodigal son, a Russian immigrant family in New York tries to outlast the omens promising its destruction.  The film owes something to Coppola, but you might feel the presence of Bergman, too. Unsentimental, unsparing, with brilliant performances by the principal cast. A must see. their children are - trust me on that.Violence was at a minimum for a Russian Mafia/hit-man picture, and the focus was on the family. Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son.Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia. 	6.8	0
My Crazy Life (Mi vida loca) (1993)	"in bittersweet comes from.  Even amid all the tragedy, men and women hook up with each other, babies are born, life goes on.  It's not the melodrama of ""West Side Story"", it's more a poignant look at life in the Echo.Production values lag at times but this is still a very fine movie and one of my favorites. wasn't the case and as a result, I was still entertained and moved.  Almost all the scenes take place in apartments, sidewalks and parks, so it's obvious that the film was made on a low-budget, but that small budget was put to good use and I give Allison Anders much credit.  My score:  7 (out of 10) takes you in the life of some harsh realities. With the good the bad and the babies they do the best they can with what they have. Survival is everything. Similar movies to see are Blood In Blod Out Bond By Honor, American Me, and raising Victor Vargas. These movies also focus on the ups and downs of gangster life. they ultimately will stand up for each other. They should, it seems no one else will. Great movie. Recommended as an escape movie. It will take you out of your world to a world you would probably never want to visit. Like life, it is not romanticized and it is not shown in an overly bad light. It just is. feelings he gets (disgust, superiority, sexual arousal) from selling drugs to desperate whites. Certain characters like Blue Eyes and Puppet were also interesting, but otherwise the story was pretty weak. There was an interesting attempt at carrying a feminist message but it didn't really work for me. If anyone knows of a better film about Chicano gangs, let me know. "	6.5	0
Love Affair (1994)	"last half was considerably better, with superb performances, especially from the two principals. I've never been a big Warren Beatty fan, but Annette Bening is WONDERFUL! (I think I've fallen in love!!!) -- To sum up, the first half of the movie rates a 3 in my book, the second half an 8 -- hence my overall grade of 5. the ego of Warren Beatty. The introduction is awful with annoying music score and edition. Mike Gambril is a detestable character and I do not see any reason for Terry falling in love with him. It is only good to see Ms. Katharine Hepburn in her last feature. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Segredos do Coração"" (""Secrets of the Heart"") to be the movie secondary theme.The original movie has been remade before this, and many other movie uses the original 'Love Affair' as an additional magnet to it. It isn't too hard to guess where the storyline went.But the ending still caught us in deep emotion. We strongly feel love in it.Recommended for Saturday evening movie with your spouse alone. even for a fairy tale.  This movie is beyond real! The jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place. As for the tear jerker ending, Warren can't even come close to replicating the look on Cary Grant's face when he realizes the devastating truth about Deborah Kerr.  Oh what I'd give for a really good love story! the emotion, the music... ""I love watching you move"" - just one of the great lines that don't go away and become part of our own lines! I have watched it over and over and every single time I feel the same emotions. The scenery is also wonderful from the beautiful island shoots to central park in autumn. 10/10 easily... "	5.9	0
Losing Isaiah (1995)	"a black doll, read obligatorily books about black characters, have black parents etc etc, you are starting down the same path as the Ku Klux Klan many years ago and it's not better but more of the same. To get back to the film, though, I would highly recommend it but would warn viewers of its failing as described above. very wishy-washy.  My viewing companion and her husband, who joined us at the end, liked it because they want to have a good relationship with their daughter's birth mother.  I agree with them on that, but if the movie is going to deal with legalities so much, it should resolve those legalities at the end of the movie. wrong. I am ""white"" my husband is Mexican- does our child belong with one or the other? Khaila's lawyer says, ""black babies belong with black mothers."" Is that what we want to teach? Segregation? Doesn't work for me. Babies of any color belong with the people who take care of them and love them. That's what being a parent is. works hard at being convincing as a reformed junkie. Strong support is provided by Samuel L. Jackson and LaWanda Richardson (the real-life spouse of Jackson)as Lange and Berry's attorneys, David Straithern as Lang'es husband, and Daisy Prince as Lange's daughter. No matter how hard you try to remain neutral, this film will suck you in and find you taking sides.  Fine acting all around. "	6.4	0
Madness of King George, The (1994)	"This is a sumptuous period drama which is never too intense, but at the same time never too pithy, and it makes for very pleasant viewing. The film never takes itself too seriously or gets bogged down - after all, what other 18th century costume drama can boast such lengthy discourse regarding the constitution of a British monarch's fetid stools? on. Hollywood flops big time in its Oscar choice of an actor, actress or film once in a while. It seems to me that the California-based Academy at times doesn't look as objectively and honestly at films produced outside the U.S. Nothing else produced in 1994 even came close to the outstanding acting by Hawthorne in this first rate film. ""I'm praying, goddammit!""The costumes are both faithful and sumptuous, the cinematography is luminous and the sets, borrowed at low cost from various castles and colleges, are lovingly handled. Of special note is the music of Handel, adapted so cleverly by George Fenton that one would swear the old boy in the knee breeches wrote the score himself for every scene. and Fox wonder if their American cousins were right about abolishing the monarchy. Ian Holm, as Dr. Wills, is properly a mixture of early pioneer of psychology and tyrant. A wonderful film of how a national crisis was met and overcome peacefully. And timely too. Within weeks of the recovery of George III in 1789 the Bastille fell in Paris. time is one of my favourites of all I have ever seen & always moves me.The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast is a veritable who's who of great British actors that Hollywood largely ignored. If you haven't seen this film, then I'd urge you to do so. Not many of you will fail to be impressed....... "	7.2	0
Frankenstein (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein) (1994)	" Robert De Niro is the creature!  De Niro gives the foul beast a soul of his own.  De Niro's performance brings out genuine pity, sorrow, and most importantly, fear. Kenneth Branagh has always added a bit of class to his films, and his version of Frankenstein is no different.  A visually brilliant triumph as a director. see why.  Sticking closer to the book than to any preconcieved notions of Boris Karloff (perhaps that's why), this injects true horror into the story of a medical student who brings a corpse to life.  If you don't like melodrama then maybe it's not the thing for you, but this deserves a far better reputation than it has. reason.  If you have read the book, regardless of whether you liked it or not,see this movie.  You will love what they have retained, and will embrace what they've changed.  this is not a film(not a movie, a film) for everyone.  But for those who are willing to have an open mind, it is pure bliss! this movie and equally class-dripping Bram Stoker's Dracula because he felt that they were competing in the same area.) There's the classic monsters (Robert DeNiro!), the period sets, the lovely heroines in the lovely period costumes, the beautiful and suitably turbulent score... Certainly not a perfect film, but as a classy, gorgeous monster movie, it is a woefully underrated one. 1995 and I have just saw it again on DVD, and it is a great movie that has not aged. Unfortunately I have never read the novel by Mary Shelley to compare with this version that ""is considered the most faithful film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Frankenstein de Mary Shelley"" (""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"") "	6.4	0
Man of the House (1995)	"to understand and further others brings happiness.The entire principle cast is great, but Man of the House also benefits from a number of excellent character actors, including George Wendt, Art LaFleur and Richard Portnow. Like most films, you'll enjoy Man of the House more, and get much more out of it, if you leave your expectations/preconceptions parked at the door. endearing, but what I really liked about this movie was Farrah. She still shines after all those years, in a completely engaging performance.Jonathan Taylor Thomas is perfectly precocious in his role as Fawcett's son, a boy who lost his father, and refuses to accept Chevy as an adequate substitute.It's funny, heartwarming, and genuinely sweet.It rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend :. an Indian Guide club. The actors in this movie, just crack me up. Also, the songs picked out for this movie just fit so perfectly. I love all the songs on this movie! The parts with music playing, just makes the movie even funnier some how! All I have left to say is, I love this movie! It is great! Chase and Thomas assume Native American Indian names and join a support group. They engage in some unfunny antics. Chase's out-of-control car ride is a relative highlight. Few appear to be having fun with this inefficient production, on either side of the screen.** Man of the House (1995-03-03) James Orr ~ Chevy Chase, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Farrah Fawcett, George Wendt Mostly just another story about a son and stepfather trying to bond. If nothing else, I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from ""SNL"" to this (maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie). But really, Chase has done better than this, as have Farrah Fawcett and George Wendt. Don't make it your first choice. "	5.1	0
Mixed Nuts (1994)	the sole purpose of being funny, no strings attached. It was so refreshing. As was this whole movie. Like a good dream! To me it is proof that when you have fun making it (which it appears impossible that they did not), you have fun watching it. At least I do... I'm gonna watch it tonight and appreciate it's wonderfulness. must appreciate black humor.  If you do, this is a delight.  I found it hilarious.  True, it's blasphemous and screwy and not at all politically correct.  That's a good start.  What follows is, at times, breathtaking. Three cheers for Madeline Kahn.  And for the courageous director and writer; a woman after my own heart. film, but if I had to, I would say Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. Her facial expressions are adorable and I would say that her best scene was when she finally made it to the bathroom (won't give too much away!). Rita Wilson also gave a top-notch performance as the pathetically adorably Kathryn. Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too! and other generalized problems.  Interwoven are stories of other problem folks.  It all seems to work out in a mad-cap way, and although this isn't the funniest movie, it is still very enjoyable, and worth the rent.  Lonely people at Christmas...and the ones they intend to help...all mixed in like cashews, peanuts, filberts...you get it!  Enjoy. them when you see them).Steve Martin has a great time with the role, as does Rita Wilson as Catherine O'Shaughnessy, Phil's co-worker. You'll really like the elevator scene. Great support from Madeline Kahn, Robert Klein, Juliette Lewis, Anthony LaPaglia, Rob Reiner, Adam Sandler, and Liev Schreiber make this movie truly one Christmas treat. Jon Stewart and Parker Posey also appear. 	5.4	0
Milk Money (1994)	"dad believes that she is a math tutor and the hooker believes he knows her true job.Ed Harris does a good job as the shy father, and Melanie Griffith is believable as the golden hearted hooker. But it's the kid (Michael Patrick Carter) the one who steals the show, with his winning smile and his mixture of innocence and curiosity. a director, and this adds to that.I know, the prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold context is a cliché, but this is a comedy, so it passes. And believe you me, this V (Melanie Griffith) is definitely a V for vendetta! Also starring Ed Harris, Malcolm McDowell, Casey Siemaszko, and a very young Anne Heche. Really entertaining, especially the report on the female reproductive system. so many levels. The interaction between the actors is fantastic. Even though it is more a light-hearted comedy the teenaged stars are given a realistic treatment throughout the film which is something rarely see in film. Michael Patrick Carter, Melanie Griffith and Ed Harris are all stellar. This movie is filled with wonderful enduring scenes and is truly a delight. through it all and understands and loves her for who she is"" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her ""this could hurt""...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm. she'll stay in the end, but still, don't leave. Ed Harris and Melanie Griffith also have near-perfect chemistry, it always helps if the protagonists of your romantic comedy look like they actually want to be there. ""Milk Money"" has its shortcomings because it's essentially an off-brand ""Pretty Woman"", but it's a childhood memory that I kinda cherish to this day. "	5.5	0
Miracle on 34th Street (1994)	I like her because she looks like my daughter when she was little.) Regardless, I love the way this story is told and Mara makes it for me. Even though logically she was taught that Santa was not real, as a little girl she was still willing to believe. Take a little joy in believing! I hope you enjoy :) filled with throngs of people, traffic on the bridges was stopped, all waiting for the verdict. I know NYC well, and how its people rise to such occasions. These scenes were not in the 1947 version, and I think they added a uniqueness to this version. Better, worse than the 1947 version? Neither - just different, and just as valid. trip out to a dream house in the snowy country, ushered by a silly salesman. The film does not seem to know when to call a halt, and there's not so much as Clarence's tinkling bell to bring back Kris at the close. It's as if the whole object of the exercise was to unite two bland characters in matrimony. whole family to enjoy.  A must buy for every family that enjoys Christmas. beg of you-if you have NOT seen the 1947 Black and White original, then please correct that. This is not an adequate substitute to a film that didn't need one in the first place. They even colorized the old one, so if you hate black and white, then you still have a color option without wasting your time on this. 	6.5	0
Miami Rhapsody (1995)	she hasn't moved into a successful film career by reading her lines with all the emotion of iron (although she looked great in the beach-shoot scene).Overall this is a fun little film that is quite slick if you are a fan of Woody Allen's relationship neurosis films.  If you're not then you'll probably do well to avoid this film. enjoyable, with a knockout performance by Sarah Jessica Parker and a nice jazzy soundtrack. Parker creates an interesting character, which is difficult in a movie like this because a lot of it is her reactions to everything going on around her. The supporting cast is also first-rate.  My only gripe is the title of the movie, which is meaningless. not limited to urban New York backdrops for its appreciation.Sarah Jessica Parker is outstanding, Banderas sends himself up perfectly as does Mia Farrow.  Other supporting cast is very strong, script is well-written and sparkles in places.  I can only attribute the relatively low rating to those that don't like Woody Allen movies; they surely would not like this. in the City) that really uses her talents as both as comedian and dramatist. It was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment. We may think it is overdone now with the re-runs of Sex in the City and all...but put yourself back in 1995. So Yeah...I liked it. for all others. 	5.4	0
My Family (1995)	"it should really make you laugh!  Of course, it also has its moments of tragedy but somehow everything ends up being okay.  I liked it!  It's definitely a movie that makes you feel!Esai Morales, Chucho, does an excellent job!  I think it's some of the best acting I've ever seen him do.I hope you see it! her, right there on the street. At first he doesn't want to, but the way by how she finally succeeds is really a must to see. He even asks her at the end of the dance ""Will you teach me how to salsa?"". For only this scene one should rent the video, the rest of the movie isn't bad either! positives to draw upon. The strong performances of the cast. Jimmy Smits, in particular, dominates the film with an intense and yet affecting performance. The film hardly ever succumbs to being a standard tear-jerker or phony. Instead, the film succeeds at creating a touching and provocative portrait of a family's struggles and tribulations in a world that hardly seems just. seems rather convenient they all have these different personas and political aspirations. When I first watched this film, I thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time. Instead of portraying Mexicans as lazy, this film really encompassed the cultural aspects and fears of the common Mexican man. A great film to watch, even if you aren't Mexican. Latino movies I ever see. Story is great and the problems are real. The characters are well played. If you like ""the goodfather"" here's the hispanic version! "	7.3	0
Murder in the First (1995)	"a boy get bullied at school, it just never ended and i remember feeling awful for the poor chap, the fact that it's a true story just makes me shudder. Gary Oldman gives one of the most hateful performances i've ever seen while Slater shows depth as the lawyer trying to get him out of prison as early as possible. a youthful, inexperienced attorney to perfection.In showing another side of Alcatraz the movie breaks away from typical escaped based Alcatraz films. While ""Escape from Alcatraz"" may still be the top movie in this topic area, ""Murder in the First"" provides a new twist that involves a different type of drama. Kevin Bacon was surely jilted for not being nominated here! Kevin, there's outstanding work from Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, and everybody's favorite drill sergeant, Lee Ermey...Moe Greene's kid, Marc Rocco, gets a great period feeling economically...solid work by the wardrobe and make-up units...this film deserved a much better fate at the box office and at awards season in '96...if you haven't seen this one yet, you're missing a real gem... a good popcorn movie, a morally inspiring story or the appreciation of a well-crafted piece of work. It falls a little short of ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but not far. Despite what this or any other review says, start this movie without any preconceived notions, and just go along for the ride. I think you will be surprised, happy and satisfied. of the movie. Two scenes where the music was used to great effect: the tracking shot after Henri attacked the other prisoner, and the setting up of the court room then dissolving into an aerial shot of Alcatraz.

Nobody's Fool (1994)	"in high relief. Excellent acting all around (this was one of Jessica Tandy's last films; also in the cast are Bruce Willis, a better actor than he is generally given credit for, and Melanie Griffith). The feeling of life in a down-at-the-heels northeast U.S. town in midwinter is superbly brought across; the movie has a real 'lived-in' atmosphere.A definite A+. Griffith). When son Dylan Walsh and his family moves back to town, Newman must finally come to terms with his family and take responsibilities that he has ignored for the duration of his life. Jessica Tandy shines in her swan song. A really great homage to Newman, one of Hollywood's very best from any era. 4.5 out of 5 stars. a fantastic ensemble all around, and at the centre the wonderful Jessica Tandy and the immortal Paul Newman in the role of his life. There is a point to this movie, painted in such subtle brush strokes that you just have to exclude all else and - what can I say - enjoy it, and let it warm your heart. Willis is amazing - relaxed, funny, cheating with a smile. Philip Seymour Hoffman, before stardom hit, has a hilarious role as a policeman trying to nail Sully and not having much luck.You can't really call what Newman does acting because you won't catch him doing it - he just IS Sully. He creates an unforgettable character in this must-see film. Griffith are magnetic on screen), gives them marvelous dialogue (""You're a man among men,"" Griffith tells Newman twice in the movie but with different meanings) and melts our hearts. But acting honors go to Newman, whose complex Sully becomes if not loving, then at least a responsible, functioning, vital member of the human race. And, in the end, nobody's fool. "	7.4	0
Nell (1994)	"different conclusions- some may see it, for example, as a religious allegory about the redeeming power of love, while others may view it in a more literal way. It may be too quiet and poetic for some tastes, but in my view this is an unjustly neglected work, one of the finest and most powerful films of the nineties. 10/10 where the actors involved feel real emotion about a scene. I'm willing to bet that moment of grace at the very end of the movie wasn't scripted nor acted on Jodie's part. You simply cannot get more heartfelt emotion into a scene than what was shown at the end of Nell. Brilliant and well-acted movie by all. A definite 10. is more normal: Nell or the people who want to put her away; Nell or the journalists; Nell or the boys in the bar? I will tell you: Nell, Nell and Nell. I can recommend this film to everyone and I hereby want to thank all people involved and especially Jodie Foster for her great performance. 7,5 out of 10 whole movie, and really liked it! It is well acted (Jodie Foster is INCREDIBLE), as is Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson, and it's just an all around GOOD movie. I recommend it very highly, and stopped short of giving it a ""10"" because it didn't have one of those neat what-happened-to-her title-over endings, though the ending IS a good one. it's pretty darned good.Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. Natasha Richardson also adds to this unique story. I would definitely recommend this film to first-time viewers but be wary it's different and not always pleasant to see and hear. I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort. "	6.5	0
New Jersey Drive (1995)	"you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what REALLY goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out.

SEE THIS FILM! and location.Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't ""actors"". Nothing was compromised in order to make good ""theater"". The only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people ""slept"" on it. I look forward to more works of art from Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future. and crime. Strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason. the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc.  It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan.authentic street movie 10/10 movie` ever.Its made very realistic and has a brutal story of survival and police brutality against juvenile offenders.You never get board because there's something going on every time,from start to finish,and the sound track makes it even better.Its like a documentary of juvenile delinquency,mostly car thefts,and life in the toughest black suburbs in New Jersey.Based on reality,true in every way!

Beyond Bedlam (1993)	from listening to the dead and conversing with them. At other times, Gilmour can apparently transfer himself out of his cell, and transform himself into other people.

Please, let there be no sequel to this, please! death with Gilmour in the past finds out and tries to stop her.Too late. The drug enables Gilmour to make his dreams become real. He never leaves his cell, but is manipulating the world around them, using their guilt and fears to terrorize them.It all sound a little preposterous, and it is confusing to follow.

Craig Kelly then i must say thats a pretty good reason, at least u know there's one bit u will enjoy, because quite frankly the rest of it is a pile or c**p and not worth the bother.

Nemesis 2: Nebula (1995)	"in a half-drunk, don't-quite-know-what's-going-on state of mind. The action scenes are a tad flat, and of course there is a whole encyclopedia of cliches, but if you except if for a low-budget action movie, which it most definitely is, then you just sit back and enjoy it. It's crap, but it's good crap, and at least it can admit it. non-stop action and narrative force, and it's awfully reminiscent of both ""The Terminator"" (in its ""messianic"" myth) and ""The Predator"" (in the look of the monster that pursues the heroine). But as B-movies go it's still somewhat above average, and Sue Price, the starring female bodybuilder, is not only impressively built but very appealing, too.     (**) that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't shown yet on DVD :-( explosions, without ever really explaining what it was all about. Luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something silly and phony going on at all times!Terrible movies are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining. Rent this film, or buy it even, you won't be disappointed! the hunter has got a lot more technical options (radar, infra-red, audio scanning, laser, whatever), his prey stands no chance normally, but has a strong survival instinct. The ending titles already announce Nemesis 3: Time lapse"". I watched the 4 Nemesis movies (which I watched first in the 1990s) again now in chronological order for my reviews and voted 7/7/5/5.

If you liked Laura in Quigley Down Under, and Pretty Woman, you'll love her here.  Her sweet, vulnerable, yet strong and assertive personality shines as does her comedic ability. This is a terrific date movie--for married folks.  Don't miss it. ... then again, from what we see today at the movies or on TV, maybe it would be accepted. For sure, watching this movie would make you want to try when you see the end results. I enjoyed every minute of it. The TV guide only had two and a half stars against it. I would have given it four!!! James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher, and in writer-director Simon Moore's 1992 `Under Suspicion' with Liam Neeson (a very good who dunnit with twists after twists and. . .more). Paul Rhys was in Robert Altman's 1990 ""Vincent and Theo"" with Tim Roth and Johanna Ter Steege (she was the disappearing wife in George Sluizer's 1988 Dutch film ""The Vanishing"".) woman and carried off the part nicely.  Fisher Stevens added to the sleaze factor of it all.  What I liked was the romance evolved and didn't go straight into sex scenes.  A believable film about two people who are attracted to each other and because both spouses are gone- follow their hearts- though they are breaking vows. my opinion, that is generous. The script is slow, the dialogue juvenile & tacky and, while the actors do their best with it, the performances are most definitely lacking. If you want a ""realistic"" feeling movie about infidelity, try ""Unfaithful"" with Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Well written, spectacularly acted & far closer to real than ""Nina Takes a Lover."" "	5.6	0
Natural Born Killers (1994)	"Well-crafted film holds your interest by making social points that are poignant, provocative, at times even satirical, but alas, they're set in the midst of noisy and excessive action scenes that are relentless and headache-inducing, not to mention extremely violent. Cast is good, especially Harrelson and Lewis who make a good match, but they need much more sturdy direction. ** take another look at.In this day and age, violence on television is becoming more and more commonplace, and this movie's relevance seems to make its viewing that much more important.  Before we go and continue to bash the hell out of it again, people need to come back and take a look around themselves and watch ""Natural Born Killers."" will make you love it and hate it. Combining the brilliant early writing skills of Tarantino, Oliver Stone's addiction to violence with the brilliant performance of Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and all the supporting cast(Rodney Dangerfield, Robert Downey Jr, Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones). Fantastic soundtrack and graphics. It's THE eye opener. The ultimate 90's movie. It's a ride! stunning.  It is intensely colorful, unflinchingly violent and innovative in its cinematography. This movie is not for most, but if you decide to try it out, be warned:  It is not for the faint of heart, and not for the weak of stomach.  But it is an important film for its visual merits, at the very least.--Shelly and especially Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden are great too. Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, although he was not too happy with the result in the end, this is one of the best satires I have seen. May be it is not for everyone, the images are not always that nice, but the meaning must be for everyone. "	7.3	0

Tomei is so beautiful in this film, it's understandable why Robert Downey Jr's character falls in love with her at first sight. The Italian scenery is incredible and would make anyone fall in love with Italy. I have since visited this beautiful country and can attest to its romantic atmosphere.

Once Were Warriors (1994)	it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence, and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is, it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long, long time. My highest recommendation. are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.  The youngest daughter is simply too small and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to re-create a form of family life.  A very powerful film, not for the faint of heart.  Morrison as Jake is one of film's most fearsome characters, full of true anger & hate but by no means a one-dimensional character.  As see the characteristics that made Beth fall in love with him in the first place, the passion, the charisma. A great script based on the novel of the same name. A must see 10/10 had the privilege of seeing it yet, then I highly recommend that you do so. George Henare's stirring Taiaha scene alone is well worth the cost of getting the movie out.(A Taiaha is a Maori spear. To use one of these, one must have immense mana, or importance. As Henare's character said, the British *feared* the highly skilled Taiaha warriors.) right along with the characters, and you will find it hard not to restart the movie just to watch it again.This is just one of the few movies that stayed with me all these years, since first seeing it back in 1995. I will never forget this movie, and if you watch it, I can guarantee that neither will you. 	7.9	1
Poison Ivy II (1996)	not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself? is quite predictable and rather slow but there is no doubt that Alyssa Milano looked extremely cute & beautiful and totally the movie belonged to her.Sex scenes in the movie are rather unconventional but interesting.So inspite of having nothing the movie lives to its B-grade sex-flicks standard and as far as Alyssa fans are considered its a feast for them. everything else in between made sense to me. This isn't a bad sequel,, i thought the original was better, but this one was more sensual, and had more depth to it sexually than the first. This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic, storyline.  I recommend that you see both films.Poison Ivy 2:  Lily is Rated R for strong sexuality and nudity, adult language, and for some violence.NOTE:  Poison Ivy 2:  Lily was released in two versions:  an R Rated version that trims some sex scenes, and an UNRATED version that contains two more minutes of sexual sequences. plot. 	4.4	0

It's a race against time as they try and locate the host animal carrying the virus, as well as save the lives of the town inhabitants before his Army superiors can carry out their own agenda. Suspenseful, well-crafted thriller is not always surprising, but it is believable and acted with conviction by a dynamite cast. *** and though the cd is short in time, it's a time I cannot forget. Particularly the end theme when it's chopper vs. plane time. What a song, keeps me in suspense every time. I like songs that are taken for film trailers as well. It's still too bad not a lot of people know about this movie.9 out of 10 to enjoy.  But what struck me the most was the cast.  I mean, this is about as good a list of actors that you will ever find in one movie, and they all deliver, just as you would expect from all this talent.  It's truly one of the most exciting movies that I've seen in some time. (Sutherland).Great acting from its talented cast and superb storytelling make a well made film which hooks you into waiting for the final outcome. Story doesn't focus on the effects of the virus, but rather the hunt for the cure, which makes a far better film.You want a hotshot scope-jockey, fine, but, frankly, I'm hurt.  Maj. Casey Schuler (Kevin Spacey) very good films since his beginnings in Germany with ¨The Neverending story¨ and ¨Das Boot¨ ,after that , he emigrated US where realized ¨Night of shattered crystals¨, ¨Enemy mine¨ , and the successful ¨Air Force one¨and ¨The patriot¨ , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake ¨Poseidon¨.

Perez Family, The (1995)	"not just pick up where they left off.It is a pleasant romantic comedy and has some very funny moments as well as an excellent cast, particularly Marisa Tomei, who pretty much drives the whole movie as the young Cuban female who tries to create a close family (with others similarly named Perez) and searching out something like an ""American Dream."" Alfred Molina is good but not as effective as his leading ladies. Chazz Palminteri is charming. The late Celia Cruz makes a pleasantly awkward appearance.'The Perez Family' is quite a charming and funny romantic comedy that gives us a glimpse of the hardships of immigrant life but also lots to laugh about. Would like to see Nair make more comedy. force the rhythm for all it is worth and here is no different.  It starts out boasting historical context and spice, falls into a rather convoluted series of plot twists that end up taking the film down a rom-com road to a solution that, although badly delivered, unthinkable and out-of-nowhere, was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film. want. Marisa Tomei was wonderful. that little sarcastic eyeroll he does when he talks about, ""Cowboys . . . and Indians!""Overall it's just such a sweet heartwarming film which is such a change from the usual ""the more depressing the more deep and artistic"" immigration film.

Leguizamo's straight man. The plot works great for me, with Baldwins odd behavior providing much of the thrust. I love the great Old New York feel the film has, which largely comes from the bakery and Sergio. In short i really love everything about this movie. Go watch it. Its on TV often enough, and a DVD recently popped up. give this a 10 out of 10 in the category of the romantic comedy.The casting is superb. Armin Mueller-Stahl is awesome as always. Joan Plowright, John Leguizamo, Sadie Frost. Each is simply perfect for their characters, and the characters are so varied and interesting.

Pulp Fiction (1994)	are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.

Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it. 	8.9	1

The most powerful message this film sends is that the Panther Party was the result of a need not simply a desire.The film may not be 'completely historically accurate;' however it does present a different view of the Panther Party and its objectives, one that is long overdue.

Priest (1994)	Yes, the film is controversial, you may not agree with some of the ideas and it looks sometimes as a cinema manifest, but it is still a good and human film. I less liked the final, which is the only place in the script where art logic seems to surrender to the religious concepts.  9/10 on my personal scale. of the movie. Tom Wilkinson, as ever, gives a performance that is as natural and believable - and likable - as anything he's done before or since. (Side note: having waited so long to watch this it's interesting to see these two actors with important roles in this year's new and glorious Batman Begins.) A truly remarkable and emotional film. a double life. Being a 'liberal' priest and breaking his vow of celibacy at the same time. But WHO are the hypocrites?

All in all, an excellent film. Watch it with an open mind, and a keen artistic eye. His performance is outstanding. Very thought provoking movie. makes you think for weeks afterward about guilt and redemption. I gave it 10/10.

Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their real-life counterparts, to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life, but to reflect on real life, to gain fresh insight, and ""Quiz Show"" achieves that purpose with dignity and style. film. But I know every film has a hater or two. But for me the film, acting wise, the film went to Ralph Fiennes, he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury. I just would highly recommend this film to anyone, this is a great film and Robert Redford did a terrific job.10/10  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.

The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see! like to think...... but ""Gaijin"", sadly, doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is ""A Thousand Pieces of Gold"". This was set over the Chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad, starred Rosalind Chao, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dun. felt the petty impulse to begrudge the few (very few) slightly misleading geographical and historical moments in the film.

Queen Margot (La Reine Margot) (1994)	Catholics and Protestants whilst surviving assassination attempts (usually via poison) and overcome tragedy as those who they care for are systematically murdered. Indeed if nothing else La Reine Margot' provides a chilling insight into one of history's most horrific atrocities and offers an unsettling portrait of the moral bankruptcy that pervaded throughout 16th century society.My Score: 8 out of 10 get where she wants, not even if she has to see her sons being killed one by one and sell her daughter in a convenient marriage to unite the Catholics and the Protestants.  The others, especially Asia Argento, impersonating the tragic countess Charlotte de Sauve  did a good job too.  A very well deserved Prix du Jury. This film only becomes better on repeat viewings. I found I was able to grasp more on my second viewing. There is so much going on, so many twists and turns and shocks, and the film is also quite long. It never lags, and even Margot's grudging tolerance, if not love, for her husband, is believingly portrayed. Very highly recommended. French Alexandre Dumas, placed in the 16th century, directed by one of France's best directors and acted by some of the most wonderful French actors and actresses of the last decades? Would you want to see this film in English? Sorry, but I think you would be missing a great deal of the depth and emotion of this unique film!!! as spacious as the loo. The film fades a bit in the second half, but it's still not a bad story, if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found `Elizabeth' more interesting and a lot less bloody. Anyway, `Margo' is very French, and not to be judged by Hollywood standards (whatever they are). 	7.5	1
Roommates (1995)	"indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed.

This movie touched me deeply. It's a real sleeper. the main characters. And DB Sweeny shows that he can have a softer side, as well as a wise cracking smooth talking side. It was a little bit of a stretch from what he is normally known for doing, but he pulled it off very well. Roommates is definitely going into my collection. I give this one 8/10. Bravo guys. fails to touch me - even after quite a few viewings! at an old age, until illness forces him to retire.

I think that is what is so great about this movie. This crusty old man really grows on you and it's hard to let him go at the end.This movie is definitely worth renting if you get the chance.

I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.  I was aching for her and Marcello Mastrioanni to interact.The ending is truly fantastic. It is very well directed and filmed. It's a good film. he could have pulled off the same feel and frenzied little European farce with a TOUCH more connective tissue in the plot. Not a lot, just a little for the audience to care about the story, the characters and whatnot. The thing I found in the film that I even cared more than a fig about was the Simone storyline. `We don't know what he looks like,' the detective complains.  `But we know what he was wearing.'  Every conversation, every plot, each detail is so thoroughly self-referencing to fashion; but mostly, there are dozens of funny moments.  Even the red herring of murder is based on our mistaking an innocent fashion item for an omen of death. in my opinion. I think the film, overall, is woefully under-rated. I feel like everyone got caught up in the idea of ""ALTMAN"" and then got confused by ""THE STARS"" and then didn't really bother to look at the movie, which has some lovely grace and is well worth the time. Then again, why listen to me, I liked Ishtar.  But it was just a hoot to watch.  I died every time Richard E. Grant came on the screen -- he's a phenomenal character actor.  I say, lighten up!

Three Colors: Red (Trois couleurs: Rouge) (1994)	"multinational co-production, with a Polish director, mixed Swiss and French cast and crew, Red was not allowed to compete for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar as a film from Switzerland. Indeed, the trilogy itself is without a country as it transcends borders and even culture in its solemn inquiry into human nature and that is a prize in itself. to imagine that ""Red"" was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed! them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream. Sadly that would become a reality as the famed director would die in 1996, still in his mid-50s. Krzysztof Kieslowski's works are highly deep and very philosophical in all major respects. His trilogy was a fitting conclusion to a wonderful career and ""Red"" is a crowning achievement to one the finest film-makers who ever lived. 4.5 out of 5 stars. a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom... and yawning, wonder what all the excitement is about.

Three Colors: Blue (Trois couleurs: Bleu) (1993)	"a commitment by the audience to really consider Kieslowski's implications, for he is telling us (throughout this trilogy) what he thinks makes a ""good"" person.

Kieslowski was one of the most talented directors, I really admired his 'Trois couleurs' trilogy but I think,'Bleu' was his most powerful film.10/10 Blue feels like a documentary and looks like a dismal Rembrandt. While Kieslowski concentrates on showing the true nature of Julie through action, Idziak contributes by showing her through light and color.Trois Couleurs: Blue is an almost unmatched achievement in the history of cinema. Never before has a character been conveyed so splendidly and in such a visually stunning manner. the piece of music which her husband has been commissioned to write... The result is a work that has less in common with the Polish 'Cinema of moral concern' of the late 1970s than with the tradition of the mainstream European art cinema, in its concerns with alienation and the loss of feeling, countered by the transcendent power of love... you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process.

Three Colors: White (Trois couleurs: Blanc) (1994)	"not the actors but the directors. Great music. Great photography. And a very intelligent script.This is a major film of the nineties--providing superb wholesome entertainment and food for thought. The film deservedly won Kieslowski the ""best director"" award at the Berlin Film festival in 1994. It is sad for the world of cinema that Kieslowski is no longer with us. not mistaken, it entirely changes the resolution of this film for the worse.  That's too bad.  ""White"" works best on its own, as a pessimistic movie, without the more optimistic outlook of ""Red"" grafted on in retrospect.  But since both films are so great on their own, I'm not too bothered by their failure to gel properly. of sincere homage to Kieslovski's art: ""Kieslowski is a director who draws his inspiration from the true life of people, who instills his own soul into his movie, who dwells upon the details as if he wanted to examine the life under a microscope."" Absolutely true. There is nothing else left to say: ""Three colors: red"" looms on the horizon. some brilliantly fitting music, plus slow motion is used very effectively. There are ideas about love, equality and revenge, the plot is intriguing, and there are some very intense moments, making it another solid entry in the trilogy, even if it is not as critically acclaimed as the first film, 'Trois Couleurs: Bleu' or the last film, 'Trois Couleurs: Rouge'. word, requires at least two people.  The central quest for liberty is personal; the struggle for equality is fundamentally social. White is the most conventional of the three Color films, and while it is still one of my ten top films of 1994, I rate it an 8, slightly less than the highly visual Blue and the mind-bending Red.

Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker (Pao Da Shuang Deng) (1994)	It's not the drama of Farewell my Concubine or Emperor and the Assassin, nor anything along the lines of Chungking Express or any kind of action fighting films.  It's not a crushingly tragic film either, btw, as one might worry from the poster of the girl with the pained look.  It's a simple story, and it works well. film is slow and the action is largely a matter of allusion, which makes it a difficult film for Western audiences; but the fiery nature of the two main characters ... the opposing colours red and green ... result in clashes and regrets in quick succession.As useful for a glimpse of life in an alien culture as for anything else.  You will not forget this film. The key is these individuals do _not_ fit into the roles they have been assigned.  And not only does the viewer get to watch the unfolding story, but one is treated to cinematography from a non-Hollywood point of view.  This is one I would love to see on the big screen.  One of my most favourite films.  Rarely did I see any character act in a manner that I expected.  I find this very refreshing in a movie if a bit confusing.  I liked the story and sympathized with the characters.  I found the film style and quality to be good or above average. I  give it a 7 out of 10. 	7.0	0

It certainly opened the lines of communication with us. in the family.I really feel it has nice interpretation of kids' difficulties who have troubles with having integration to family life, and well, I am pretty sure I will be somewhat clueless when it comes to dealing with kids like the parents.Brilliant movie? Not. Worth to see? Of course, give it a chance. Don't get fooled by the low rating. together. The other kids were good too.There was plenty of physical comedy, and nothing to concern parents. The closest this movie ever got to PG: Russ and Valerie were 'interrupted', but of course younger kids wouldn't know what they were getting ready to do in bed.This was fluff and somewhat predictable, but it was the kind of movie I enjoy.

Perphas what is notable for the movie, it is one of the earlier written scripts by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen, The Recruit).

Stuart Saves His Family (1995)	"unfamiliar with the 12-step junkie will find a sweet and surprisingly honest story here -- one that both pokes fun at self-help groups and acknowledges that they can work. There are plenty of laughs; and in its treatment of Stuart's highly dysfunctional family of origin, this film achieves something near-great. Watch and see. And ""get yourself to a pound cake!"" be a good movie. On the other hand, it wasn't tastelessly laugh-out-loud funny. In fact, I only remember laughing once in the whole movie.So did ""Stuart Saves His Family"" accomplish its goal, or did it fail miserably? I'm not quite sure. I still don't know what to think of this movie. I'd say it's worth renting just for its uniqueness. more than it misses. If you have a dysfunctional family or can identify with any of Stuart's relatives, it's worth the hour and a half....While it won't win any awards, it should be worth an hour and a half of your time... I give it 6/10 for the average person.... 8/10 if you have a highly diversified and dysfunctional family. Hollywood movie, this would be a romantic-interest scene, because everyone knows you can't have a male and female star in a movie without their getting together. Well, here it's that incredibly rare thing: a scene of genuine friendship and support, with Stuart's sexuality left out of the question. To me, that's more impressive than if they got into a liplock. the butt of the joke. Al Franken is very good and the character is given more subtlety than he had on SNL. Vincent D'Onofrio plays his younger brother, Harris Yulin his father, Shirley Knight his mother and Lesley Boone his sister. Laura San Giacomo and Julia Sweeney also co-star as Stuart's friends. Not a great movie, but a nice one. "	5.3	0
Swan Princess, The (1994)	"the first one for me. There is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. The difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began yearning for the first one and wishing I'd never set eyes on the third.Do yourself and favor and don't waste your time. the kids I would honestly say it's a go. It's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so I'm going to cut the film some slack. It was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, I grew up with the first one, so I guess it was just stuck in my head.4/10 Jean Bob is noticeable, and is sorely missed. The dialogue is not always involving, particularly when Derek says ""I'm not going to lose Odette."" And like the Secret of the Castle, the overall film is too short, and not helped by the silly romance between Rogers and Zelda. In conclusion, a flawed but much better second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox. (not voices remain).  Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread.

This is a lovely drama featuring a child rather than a kid's movie, but it works on either level. so common with most American child characters.  Imagine being told an old family story by your favorite Uncle or Grandfather while sitting around a living room late at night, with only the low light provided by the glow of a fire or one old lamp so nothing distracts your imagination's journey.  That is what this film is like... any bad performances at all.The Secret of Roan Inish features some beautiful Irish music, both instrumental and Irish-language, and of course features lush cinematography of the Donegal area and coast.  Beautifully shot, wonderfully written and performed, and masterfully directed, The Secret of Roan Inish will delight everyone in the family.  Don't hesitate to buy or rent this one.  With the music and the intricate storytelling, one can become truly lost in this story.  And truly a part of it.  If I had children, this is one movie I would have them watch over and over again.  Like Disney's ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"" this is a movie to entertain children of all ages. told so vividly, so beautifully, that it held my 6 and 9 year old daughters rapt in spite of the fact that it did not resemble a Disney Channel video.Anyone who can appreciate folklore tales should love this movie.

To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure.

It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night! it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt.

If you have no such memories, you may not understand this movie. Thumbs up to Tim Allen and Judge Reinhold! Thanks for the happy tears! in the way of family entertainment, the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before-- but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10. a holiday classic. Great for the family. 10/10! and I love when he burned the roast! I also thought the actor who played Bernard the elf was very funny and stole every scene he was in. And I especially enjoyed Judge Reinhold's turn as Neal Miller. I love the scene where he finally gets the hot dog whistle he'd wanted since he was a kid! Great holiday fun! I also laughed when he imitated cats and dogs fighting. Oh, man, those parts were funny! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Tim Allen has scored huge!""

Shallow Grave (1994)	"and stylish film made on a small budget, driven by a cleaver story and interesting characters.  Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccleston both give great performances in this film.  `Shallow Grave' is miles better than any thriller Hollywood has come up with in the last 10-15 years (if not longer).  I give it an 8 out of 10. the virtuosity of ""Trainspotting"" here, his trademarks are all present: the fast pace, the urban background beats, the enthralling camera angles and so forth.The three leads are all great, but there's no question about who the movie belongs to: Ewan McGregor is energetic, powerful and photogenic in his portrayal of a young journalist. No wonder he became such a star. done with style and clever wit, with a couple of nice twists that I doubt anyone will see coming.  (Although, I'm a little hazy on just HOW it ends up that way.)

A landmark film of the '90s gone unnoticed! his directly opposite physical type. The filmmakers  seem to expect the audience to be able to watch the movie on more than one level. The story allows the audience to consider the obvious questions about the  nature of identity, but the stylization allows the audience to consider the different  questions about the nature of the film experience. fantastic job. Some of the compositions and the overall cinematography are also handled with skill with some shots being smartly composed. What really made a lasting impression was the way the film handles reality, and the reality that the camera sees. Don't let the silly title and the black and white film stock keep you away from this unique movie. the other as a pawn for his devious scheme involving murder and mistaken identity.  If I could mention two scenes that reminded me of Hitchcock, it would be these: 1) the first scene that sets up the film, and 2) Vincent explaining his dreams to a psychiatrist--reminiscent of ""Spellbound.""  This is an excellent thriller that should be seen. visual aspect of the film alone is worth a watch.

Yet superb performances by the two male leads eventually move beyond stereotypes they  and the audience  initially share about each other, transforming their unexpected friendship into a statement that puts the lie to official groupthink in a repressive regime. in a way: by his friendship with Diego, David begins to think, develops a maturity of spirit - and is also, at last, able to develop a loving and mature relationship with a woman. It is very sweet when he tells Diego: ""No-one will hurt her. She is with me.""A true gem of a film. I recommend it to everyone. movie, and nothing that you need to hide from the kids.

Swimming with Sharks (1995)	"and its message can be construed either as darkly humorous satire against Hollywood, or as a nihilistic comment on the ways of mankind.  Judging by the not-so-humorous tone of the movie (though ludicrously enough it was marketed as a comedy), to me it feels like the latter applies.  Definitely worth seeing, even if only for Spacey.  8/10 to clichés. The ending is a punch in the stomach, I never expected it.Whaley is good at playing the over/underwhelmed everyman and the direction is OK (if just so). The best aspects are the witty script and Kevin Spacey's scene-stealing performance; together he has good chemistry with Whaley and the movie succeeds based on the actors' success in their roles. out of three characters ""win"". Huang seems to be suggesting that the professional world ain't likely to change any time soon, and that even if you try to change it or manipulate the game itself, you're likely to just get eaten up by it, processed by it and incorporated into it anyway. Again, I can't say I disagree with him. and the desperate and confused Guy, but ultimately good does not prevail, and the shooting and Buddy's manipulation of the situation remove us from both characters as the film ends.All in all, Swimming with Sharks is an enjoyable film. The simple plot and small cast are compensated for by some fine performances; it's funny , well-acted, and definitely worth watching. Swimming with Sharks is about delusion and corruption, and how much the human spirit can take. It just happens to be set in Hollywood, but Buddy Ackerman could be Gordon Gecko in a different market. Worth watching to see Spacey enjoying himself in a role where he gets to say pretty much whatever he likes, and does so with relish. "	7.1	0

(For other references to similar scenarios, see MURIEL'S WEDDING, SWEETIE and of course, MOULIN ROUGE.)But for me, it's a rare-look back at the kind of risk-taking that Russell may never again explore in his career.

But add to that some truly stunning views of Sydney, some great comedy, and a really charming romance between the father and a woman he met through a dating service, and you have one of the great cinematic delights of the 1990s. See this film and you will be glad you did. borders on bland. The most surprising thing you can say about it is not the (discreet) man-on-man make-out scenes, but rather the fact it's Russell Crowe acting in them.

It filled the void where drama and action films had worn away movie goers in the mid 90s.  Watch for Tommy Chong as the bus driver and the chemistry, whether electrified or jaded between the characters. his movie isn't bad. Lots of laughs, but no enlightening philosophy. It is a great movie for large gatherings. It's not as great as Animal House, but then, what is? this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited.

The assassin, Travis, Star Trek fan, manipulator of the young and all around comedy fall guy. These actors are the ones who make us laugh.

Even if you don't, see this movie anyway - it may change your mind about this genre.From personal experience: ""Chicks dig this flick."" Get the popcorn & enjoy. right off, I was too busy enjoying the ride. But if you look at all of the characters, it's the women who are strong, and all of the male characters are either villains or are defective in some way (1/2 human Rippers).It was (and is) one of my favourite flicks and I can be very critical of badly done movies. movies. Instead of the usual male buddies, you have two sassy young woman, while a genetically modified and not very bright kangaroo plays the part of the Bond girl.

Get over it.) creating characters from underneath their Ripper make-up... they're so good that one of the best parts of Tank Girl is just watching and listening to them.This isn't a movie to go into with high expectations.  Read all the negative comments, take them to heart, and then watch the movie anyway.  It will make Tank Girl a pleasant surprise. (it IS difficult) so it bombed but it acquired a cult following.

Tales from the Hood (1995)	"succeeds. It has things to say about racism in our society and says them in ways in which they've never been said before. Though definitely not for all tastes, TALES FROM THE HOOD is a surprisingly solid horror anthology.* *Cast Note: Clarence Williams III, who plays the funeral director, is best known as Linc from THE MOD SQUAD television series. In the film's most powerful sequence, Cundieff serves up a quickly cut montage of unsettling images culled from a number of state historical archives depicting vicious, stomach-churning lynchings meant to deter the rapacious young killer from wanting to harm any more people.  It's potent stuff, and makes one wish the rest of the film had this kind of intensity. time honored tradition of horror/exploitation movies everywhere, the guilty are punished with gory deaths and lessons are learned (frequently too late). Is it preachy, didactic social satire? Perhaps, at times. But it's also entertaining as hell. It has a great cast, some really cheesy, over-top-the-top acting, and was produced by Spike Lee. For me, that makes it almost required viewing. so scary is that it is true and that nothing is being done about it. The issue of gang violence is something that really needs to be addressed.""Tales from the Hood"" is a very good movie no doubt, despite its flaws. But you need to watch this movie, not expecting a horror film, but a very important social studies lesson. of horror, Tales remembers to keep its monsters metaphorical. Police brutality, domestic violence, racial profiling, and gang violence are the most hideous creatures found here. I complement Rusty Cundieff on a job well done there. Excessive campiness and at-times generic camera work keep this from being great, but nothing stops its relevance in the genre.STAR RATING: *** out of 4. "	6.3	0

It's one of those movies that takes it's time to grow on you.7/10 since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms. However Carpenter's US town sees the children uniformly garbed with no reason, other than to draw attention to their uniformity in a massively clumsy and illogical visual device.Take my advice, watch the original and avoid this. It's one strictly for carpenter fanatics, not people who are simply fans of his work. fundamentalists appear to confront the children. All we're missing is a fat burgomeister in lederhosen.The eyeball effects are good, adding color change to the original glow (which effect, by the way, still stands up in the B/W version).

This movie is unashamedly stupid, but if you'll just relax it's also one of the funniest films you'll ever see.Ok, it has a paper-thin plot, but it does contain some cinematic firsts: a moose breaking its way out of a classic car; Rob Lowe being electrocuted through his pecker; a fat man in a little coat.See this film. Twice so much fun. If you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit to his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick! "	7.1	0

Avoiding the common temptation of drawing out the play's anguished characters at a snail's pace, Malle also paces the film well, with an emphasis on lightness and subtlety of delivery - the result is both intellectually and emotionally satisfying. do together. I never believed so many giggles and gasps and stutters and excited silences could be so finely woven, tossed so lightly. This is really, really good stuff, very smart. So far as an intelligent construction you won't see a superior. I never expect to see four levels at once again in film at least centered in the acting. via Wally Shawn's cup which has I Love NY written on it then later Andre explains to the visitors (who, I suspect, have been planted there for just that purpose) that it's now a different time. The acting throughout is beyond praise and a wonderful high note for Louis Malle to end his career. 10 out of 10 going away. Both of those films place the play on an inner level of the film's overall plot, and thus they try to teach us the inner workings of the plays themselves and acting as an art on the whole. Anyway, since I am tired and no longer in control of my thoughts, per se, I will just say 10/10, goodnight everybody! "	7.5	1
Underneath (1995)	"work out what the weaknesses with them were.  Add to this a quite straightforward story that is told in three timelines for no discernible benefit to the film and then a cheap series of dramatics when all else fails and you've got a film that doesn't tend to get mentioned in the same breath as his more recent hits. to a local hood (William Fichtner), a fact she neglected to tell him.To get out of trouble with the hood, he agrees to do an armored car robbery. His own brother (Adam Trese) suspects him.One of director Steven Soderbergh's early works, it will not blow you away, but it will entertain you. I suspect the ending will leave you furious. And, the most I could say for the climax was that it did.  But it also spiraled into a conventional, predictable, and altogether disappointing ending.  I walked away unhappy with the whole experience.  This was the first time I was disappointed with Soderbergh's work, so for a more satisfying experience, in a similar genre, see The Limey. Malone (T. Azimuth Schwitters) as the guy who attempts to hit on Allison Elliott in the club and is rebuffed, and David Jensen (Elmo Oxygen) as the satellite dish installer.

Our protagonist, Mr. Johnny Depp did his usual amazing work, but it is the performance by Leo that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again.

""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is an excellent movie! Gilbert's own life. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town. The performances of Johnny Depp, Leonardo Dicaprio, Darlene Cates and Juliette Lewis are unmatched and truly wonderful. It is a film woven together with comedy, drama, love and everyday emotion, perfected with beautiful cinematography and superb directing. events in the story. And the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her mother make things interesting for Gilbert. The ending is unexpected, very solid and sad.

Virtuosity (1995)	series. But where other films in the genre have used such tools as wit and plot to keep the more intelligent of the viewers amused, this film, um, hasn't.The script is terrible. The acting (excluding Crowe, who only gets away with it thanks to a camp smile and some fortunate direction) is wooden. And the plot is illogical and frustrating. are many other ideas or methods that could have really made this movie something but of course this did not happen. It went for cheap effects, an over used clichéd storyline with a little bit of a twist. That may work for some people but not for me.I'am giving this movie a 6/10 rating because it had so much potential. killing machine.  There are some humorous moments, somewhat lessening the overall dark and somber tone. On the down side, the ending may be a little too pat and leave a few loose ends untied.  Recommended for science fiction and action movie fans who are on the lookout for lesser known films that may satisfy them for an evening. did an excellent job of portraying the demented cyber villain. I especially liked Denzel Washington, who always manages to be believable in his role when he doesn't try to be a soul brotha.' Granted, the cinematography was pretty average as well as the music, but then again, the performance of the two main stars really made this film a winner. effects. Not really. The cast is good, and Crowe turns in a solid (if a bit hammy, but most bad guys are, aren't they?) performance. Washington is no better or worse than usual, which means the real culprit is the script here. Do yourself a favor and wait for a two-for-one night at your video store to see this one. 	5.6	0
While You Were Sleeping (1995)	believe Bullock as well. He then starts to fall in love with her and vice versa.

The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.

You can watch it a million times and never get tired of it. **** It's like you've seen it all before, but Sandra makes you want to see it again.

Double Happiness (1994)	"subtlety in the way writer/director Mina Shum presents Jade's nervous breakdown of a life, a subtlety which craftily creates the effect of slowly drawing the viewer into the spiralling life of Jade.  With its powerful, yet simplistic (in the Hal Hartley vein) direction and tremendous performances, Double Happiness stands as a remarkable film which deserves more attention.  Pity! at the outcome of this pairing.I was very impressed by Callum Rennie, who played Jade's caucasian boyfriend Mark. There's a quite funny scene between these two that involves a talk about bad clam chowder and ""fascist"" bouncers. The chemistry/tension between Jade and Mark was great. The rest of the family was great too. Truly a must see movie about relationships. and he's as awkward, sweet, and appealing as ever.  The interstitial scenes of characters speaking to the camera are an interesting experiment--a good tool for revealing character, they nevertheless are sometimes jarring.  Overall, the film is like a compact colorful flower:  it won't dominate the landscape but it richly awards the lucky soul whose attention it captures. of two cultures would bring.  As the child of an Asian father and American mother (but raised almost entirely American, I'll admit), I found that scene very interesting.I think this film was wonderful, and that one need not have a particular interest in Asian families to appreciate the family and social relationships, conflicts, and hopes portrayed in Double Happiness. with other user's comments that the film is too myopic.  This movie obviously deals with very personal feelings, and I would only expect Mina Shum to create a film reflecting her point of view. To make it far-reaching and covering several other viewpoints would dilute the film's vision and make it seem less honest and direct than it does. "	7.1	0

I'm glad that it was produced in Australia.  If it had been done in France then Hollywood would have done a remake in English and probably ruined it. value. Her feelings are so true to her heart and I am sure many can relate. Griffith's character is portrayed with such humor and honesty.

Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995)	"I also missed some faves from the books (I always enjoyed Kristy's older brothers, whenever they showed up, and some of my favorite charges were missing.) but i know that not every character could be cast - finding ways to involve each one would result in an insanely long movie. Overall, it's cute. But I'll take the books any day. for Kyla Pratt, Scarlett Pomers (""I've been to the moon!""), Larisa Oleynik, Rachael Leigh Cook, Marla Sokoloff, and Austin O'Brien.  So all in all I've chosen to look past the cheese and realize that this movie is just a G-rated romp about friendship that really isn't a waste of your afternoon to watch.  7 stars out of 10. played Stacey(april 3rd is her birthday like mine) is beautiful but i haven't seen her before. The girl who played the shy and sensitive MaryAnne was also a cutie but haven't seen her before. The girl who played Dawn,I've seen her in 10 things i hate about you. I can't believe how young she looked. I gave it a 10. in Stoneybrook.On top of that, Claudia has summer school, Mary Anne is the only person to know the truth about Kristy and Alan Gray (stupid jerky dweeb extraordinaire) is trying to date Dawn using tips from Logan.  And diabetic Anastasia Elizabeth McGill is in love with a guy four years her senior.That's pretty much the books done for you revolved around homework, best friends and relishing in the freedom of the summer hols.One thing, however, that struck me while watching the film.

At that age, I'd be hiring a babysitter for *them* since they're as young as the kids they babysit! "	5.8	0

Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will quickly find it tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **½ into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim. without Carrey (Albeit, they're not many of them) really just shows this movie doesn't have much else going for it besides the man himself. Many of the other actors/actresses (Including Courtney Cox) just aren't funny. But this movie, in my opinion, deserves an 8, because it's just really showcasing Jim Carreys excellence.

The musical numbers are worth watching alone, but combined with the story and all the sub-plots and the funniest lines I have heard in a long time (The ABBA turd convo cracks me up every time), this is a movie to buy and watch over and over when you need to be entertained as well as dazzled!!!!!!! of my life! I wasn't the least bit uptight about it (as some people were turned off by the flamboyant behaviour and distasteful jokes, which I found refreshingly great!), and delighted in the campy antics of this fantastic trio! It's a beautiful, feel-good comedy that I recommend to anyone with a catty sense of humour (and a VERY open mind). about the nutty folks out there. the costumes are great and gobsmacking, they perform very well in the musical numbers.I showed this to my mum, after the initial shock she was very amused and agreed with me that it was a very funny movie.I will watch this movie a lot in the future, why?? It keeps me laughing every time. "	7.5	1
Bitter Moon (1992)	"movie arouses a range of emotions from dread to empathy to disgust to hilarity.  The story line is far too complicated to synopsize appropriately in this review. Bitter moon is a great film, one of this reviewer's top 10 for the 1990s. Another must see!  A word of caution, however, Bitter Moon is not a good date movie. fact that it oversteps the mark on several occasions, Polanski's film always feels real and the lesson in the love that the film teaches is duly noted. Bitter Moon is a film that will get under your skin and stay there and not only that but there's enough happening to ensure that this is always a fun watch.

Bullets Over Broadway (1994)	"cast members of the play in production. Mary Louise Parker and Harvey Fierstein, Rob Reiner are also seen in smaller roles.""Bullets over Broadway"", as most of Mr. Allen's films has a great musical score of the jazz songs of the era. Mr. Allen, in taking a seat behind the camera, delivers one of his best and funniest films to date. actors who do the traditional Woody role  he gives a slight impression at times rather than cutting out the role as his own.Overall Woody Allen may not be everyone's cup of tea  but for fans this is him at his whimsical best.  Not a classic comedy but a warm Allen film that sparkles in nearly every scene. the plot, amazing performances, authentic feel of the era and great musical score. ""Bullets over Broadway"" is pure delight from the beginning to the end. The best I could describe the film - to paraphrase the famous line from John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address: ""Ask not what Art can do for you — ask what you can do for Art"".9.5/10 gangster who becomes also playwright from a certain moment on. Some of his interventions lack authenticity. But this is only a minor flaw in the whole. Like all the other Woody Allen's movies this one seems superficial at first sight but it's well made and deep enough to amuse us and simultaneously make us think and feel life in it. Allen, with customary finesse, affectionately transports us back to the glitzy, gin-peddling era of Prohibition and slick Runyonesque antics.I remember the times when the opening of a new Woody Allen film was a main event.  As such, ""Bullets Over Broadway"" is a comedy valentine to such days. In any respect, it's a winner all the way, especially for Woodyphiles. "	7.5	1
Clear and Present Danger (1994)	"he is equally at ease with the quiet parts and the loud ones, particularly an RPG-powered car ambush centerpiece. The action beats are used sparingly but with brilliant precision.All in all, this is smart, tight, believable and expertly executed. It is that rare brainy ""action"" film that will involve you and have you hanging on the edge of your seat. and Henry Czerny and Miguel Sandoval - not big names but recognizable and good actors. The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific. The best action scene was shootout in the streets with snipers firing at cars below. The positives are far more than the negatives, making this a solid thriller. fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this. film is perfectly balanced so that there is not a single boring scene in the picture. The wheels are constantly turning to make sure something dramatic is happening to really draw you further into the picture. I recommend this movie as well as it's two predecessors, ""The Hunt for Red October"", and ""Patriot Games"". Both of which are equally brilliant. Félix Cortez who has inside info in the White House and plans of his own.It's an intriguing political espionage mixed with some well executed action scenes. The ambush in Bogota is terrific action.

It's really pretty good. But the cast is so outstanding that any weakness in the story is the more highly illuminated. See it, if only to see the range of facial expressions into which Jones is able to fashion his face. this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old.Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10. a perfect fit as the ""Revered"" Roy Foltrigg.  Will Patton as Sergent Hardy, was an excellent sleezy and conniving officer.When I saw Anthony LaPaglia as Barry ""The Blade"" Muldano, I didn't envision the greasy sleezeball he portrayed, but someone more tougher or perhaps more thuggish.

An endearing little treasure, 'Corrina, Corrina' is a motion picture filled with heart and laughter, that's sure to send your spirits soaring.

Rating: Three 1/2 out of Five Stars (Very Good). to be seen in ""Waterworld"") was just as impressive. But the theme of two minority groups (Jewish and Negro) coming together in the way they did was done in absolutely good taste and a delight to any liberal thinking viewers.

His dollying techniques (placing actors on dollies), lens choice, and manipulation of color conspire to add special characteristics to this film.

The odd struggle and perceptions of reality that we all face coming up...the embarrassment of a family, the neighborhood bully, etc....all gets played out in this summer classic.--Not to mention the cinematography is wonderful and interesting. of the film revolves around - even if she has less than Troy.Tonally the film doesn't quite click.

Cobb (1994)	"Face in Batman Forever. Let that sink in for a minute. Robert Wuhl plays himself as he always does. The movie is entertaining in spots. The comedic parts work better than the dramatic. I can't really recommend it because the bad outweighs the good and, personally, knowing about Stump leaves a bad taste in my mouth over the whole thing. part about it is that now you have millions of people who watched it thinking it was all true, which in return has besmirched this person's name. I would never watch this garbage again even if you paid me. Don't waste your time or money. It's all a bunch of bull, and it's not even that great of a movie. it is to the real Cobb, but regardless of this it is a really enjoyable character piece with a great central performance.  It keeps the audience by swinging wildly between the comic, the dark and the tragic, keeping us with it all the time.  It is a dark drama but still enjoyable and sadly great underrated and underseen. also circle the bases faster than anyone who has ever played the game, with his spikes sharpened.

We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both.

A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks.

Entertaining, pleasant and funny, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10. blunder in execution, we make utter fools of ourselves, and yet we don't give up.  We still strive.  We still search for that perfect someone.  And the glory is -- sometimes we get lucky.Going along on this quest with Grant and friends is as enjoyable an entertainment as you're lucky to find in your local DVD section. These are some very talented people. As a fan of British humor, I am especially pleased with the incredible writing along with the acting. Not to mention some of the scenery. If someone is feeling low, this is a great movie to watch to lift the spirits. I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting or needing a good laugh. emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth, loud, extrovert and excessively hearty (like most characters Callow plays).To sum up, this was a very good film indeed; proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 8/10 is at a wedding and is seated with all of his ex-girlfriends. The scene is set up for utter humiliation. Even with the quick-witted characters, and all the weddings, it wouldn't be a movie without that touch of drama that for many might just get a tear out of them.Hands down all around great movie to fit most every occasion. 	7.1	0
Higher Learning (1995)	"notion that he will be partial to the black characters?So where a lot of people seem to think the message is black=good white=evil, I see it as It doesn't matter who's wrong and who's right because we need to put our differences aside and get along (almost equally clichee, I know, but still a different message entirely) Signed, white dude with real issues like racism and date rape and drunken behaviour. It's refreshing because colleges are usually shown as places where nice middle-class kids never have any problem bigger than being dumped by their boyfriends before everything is resolved in the last reel.An overly maligned movie. Not perfect but better than a million other college movies. Loved the ending too. and scenarios.  The film tries to go all deep and the final shot of the word `unlearn' against an American flag just feels like Singleton must have thought that he had been making incredibly profound points the whole time - instead it felt that his original idea had had a deeper point, but it was totally lost in delivery. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you'll find ""Higher Learning"" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10 message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.

I Like It Like That (1994)	"that low.   This film has terrific acting, great characters and a couple - and their young son - who you just root for.  Add to that a strong supporting ensemble, and I would unashamedly rate it a 9 out of 10.  i do have to see it again, but I remember just really 'digging' this film! guts it took to not give this movie a fairy-tale ending.  We have no miraculous resolution, but instead a hard-fought and bittersweet partial reconciliation.  The acting and writing here carry a good film to a satisfying conclusion.  I'm tempted to vote higher than I really feel to boost this movie's overall rating, which I feel is undeserved. a man, his performance as ""Alexis"" showed a depth that few actors ever accomplish.  In addition to his sterling performance as ""Tudee"" in ""Follow Me Home"", his portrayal in this film convinced me of his tremendous range.

I Love Trouble (1994)	"some scenes and the cuts between them.  The only problem here is that once the same trick is employed more than once or twice it becomes a little tiresome.We're left with a very standard piece of work, but one that works just hard enough to keep it relatively entertaining but not quite memorable, even for Nolte and Roberts fans. not hopping into bed within the first half hour (in refreshing contrast to most modern films), leaving a little time for storytelling and character development.This is definitely describable as a ""flick"" (for guys or chicks); its spirit is in keeping with its title. Personally, I'm a great Julia Roberts fan. This isn't her best picture but, nevertheless, it's quite watchable. click, mainly because the lines in the script are so stale. The picture looks expensive, and the plot isn't a con (I suppose it is fully thought out), but who even wants to see Julia Roberts in a Tracy-Hepburn knock-off like this? And who wants to see her kissing Nick Nolte? The whole concept is, well, Troubled. *1/2 from **** don't see what's the point of both Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson keeping out-scooping each other.Nevertheless, until the first hour the movie is okay and contains some good humor. Besides, Nick Nolte is great as Peter Brackett and Julia Roberts is not bad as Sabrina Peterson.Overall, not a great movie, but certainly not as bad as they make it sound. made what could have been an okay mystery-comedy into total enjoyment.

I really enjoyed this film quite a bit and I hope that you will too.  Thanks for reading,-Chris Predictable every step of the way, and hard to believe (though it's purportedly based on a true story), but it's so well-performed, so irresistibly charming, so sweet and romantic that you really don't mind. Not only a good showcase for the film's three ideal leads, but also a kindhearted film that gives hope to the notion of human decency. *** Although you wonder why Cage married her in the first place, she gives a humorous and entertaining performance. Of course there's kitsch but that's not necessarily bad. Good kitsch can be wonderful and this film, that has an absolutely great happy ending, serves as a perfect example of how a romantic comedy should be filmed. It's better than ""Pretty Woman"". demands of a furious Muriel; if despite reaching a financial and emotional low they can still invite Angel in to put some food in his belly; and if the New York public can show their appreciation by doing whatever little they can to help out; then maybe, just maybe, there might be hope for the rest of us.This.

Until that point, sports were something you did or read about. You might go to a contest purely for the association of the thing.What her art did, incidentally, was she made sports cinematic. And we may all be the worse for it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. I had the benefit of second-guessing the subtitles as well.  Some were wildly wrong, and none could capture the tonal nuances, the careful phrasing, and the subtle interplay between Mueller and Riefenstahl as they parried one another's verbal thrusts.  While far less original and profound than the master's work being discussed, Mueller did a very creditable job here. the winning side of the war, according to Ms. Riefenstahl, a tough old broad who was apparently ecstatic about being interviewed. Up to a point.This is a top-notch documentary. The cinematography is gorgeous. The probing questions are important. Riefenstahl is alternately combative, charming, evasive . . . and a whole lot of other things.I give it a 9 of 10. of work but reveals many of innovative techniques she pioneered. Her accomplishments are all the more impressive when one considers the role of women in her heyday.However, the most interesting aspect of this film for me is how this intelligent woman (still lucid in her 90's) deals with queries about her political involvement during the National Socialist period in Germany. as a movie maker was finished. Had she been working for the equally repulsive dictator Joseph Stalin a finding that she was a Communist sympathizer would not have hurt her as much as the Russians were on the winning side.

Lion King, The (1994)	"is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout. almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata! are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++ voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10. a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age.

In fact, Scorsese rips this movie off dreadfully, even to the same wiping out of the sand pattern at the end. on his quest for enlightenment.As for the rest of the movie, well, it just dragged in a lot of places and the characters just were not all that believable.If you know little or nothing about Tibetan Buddhism and would like to get a sense of it without getting into heavy dogma and spiritual practice, this movie is a nice intro. much.The movie is also beautiful to watch. The cinematography, the editing and the direction combine to provide just the right dramatic tension to a movie whose pacing is deceptive, in that it seems slow, but is not. The ultimate result is that a viewer who allows it, will find him or herself transported for a little while, to unexpected places. for nothing else, it is worth watching for the beautiful scenes.  I was fascinated watching Keanu as Siddhartha. He really seemed to lose himself in the role. I would really recommend this movie when you are in the mood for something gentle, beautiful to look at and at the same time, providing an interesting insight into the Buddhist world. the coolly modern Seattle (by giving it a blue tint) and the older, earthier India and Nepal (shot with an orange and red theme).  Chris Isaak turns in a subtle and tender performance as the conflicted Dean Conrad.Ruocheng Ying's performance as Lama Norbu is superb.

Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close).

In short, Harpo's stories (e.g. several ""croquet fanatic"" episodes) offer a telling comedic counterpoint to Mrs. Parker's almost continually cynical and self-pitying pathos.  Read Harpo's book to balance out the negative.

The cast is first-rate, particularly Campbell Scott. It is a very quotable movie, full of venomous one-liners, most courtesy of Mrs. Parker.

Mrs. Parker's only comfort in life is the friendship she has with Bob Benchley (an excellent Campbell Scott).  Leigh,  speaking with a facinating accent,  brings sadness and cynicism to Mrs Parker with perfection. is frustrating to only hear snippets of their lines. I suppose the idea was to toss these famous lines away to add naturalism. However, without spotlighting the conversations of the legendary characters, however contrived this might be performed, this is just a very sad movie about a bitter, unhappy, self-destructive, unproductive writer. Not very easy to watch nor very interesting. "	6.4	0

No, there's not a lot going on here, but the all-star cast makes it worth a peek. is unforgettable as the head of a rival paper. This group of actors may very well comprise one of the most talented ensembles of the 1990s.It's a shame THE PAPER has never received the attention it deserved. Had it been released 50 years ago, in a less cluttered era, it would most certainly be widely hailed as a classic today. Ron Howard.Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the ""stop the presses"" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast.

Mel Gibson's otherwise rubbish ""Whast Women Want"").I saw this in the cinema, and own it on DVD - it features in my regular rotation, and it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, it is still good viewing. A sign of a classic film is how often one can view it without finding scope for criticism - nothing yet! it's like to be working in the newspaper business, with deadlines, dealing with superiors and the things you have to go through sometimes in order to get the job done.

""knowledge and education are power"" but are not taught that credibility and respect are things which must be earned and that very few people actually start out at the top of the career ladder.Overall, this continues to be one of my favorite films and I appreciate the myriad of messages that it sends, though they may, at times, be contradictory. and Janeane Garofalo is stunning as the low self-esteem serial one night stander with the AIDS paranoia and over-full shag book.  Also, great cameos from the Soul Asylum geezer and Evan Dando's stunning turn during the end credits add to the film.  Overall a stunning film, admittedly which will probably only be appreciated by a relatively narrow demographic. a flat with a guy who mooches off me, sleeping around with strangers, dancing at the gas station, etc. The movies have a lot more influence on young people than one thinks. In my gut, I felt two things: a-My parents would be horrified if I brought friends like that around and more frighteningly, b-I secretly would agree with them. with each viewing.  It's routinely panned for reasons that I really can't comprehend. It's witty, well-acted, quickly paced.  I notice that people don't talk as badly about it anymore.

So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche? to criticize with this one.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch.I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show. charming, so I usually do.The movie pokes fun at the super rich on a superficial level, but that's all right. I'll save the harshly critical movies for a different mood. There's some lovely views of the Biltmore estate. There's light ribbing of the corporate world. Oh dear, I'm falling asleep. I'll miss the end of the movie. Too many brewskies. that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help. He combines emotional and rational qualities without violating his basic identity as a kid. To me, that's all good, and redeems the entertainment value of this movie for a young audience. and the family's fortune, so he tries to kill mum and dad -Ritchie needs the other kids's help to save the company, his parents and his fortune aided by The butler.Not a bad movie it has a very good moral story (all the money in the world can't make you happy)- But strictlty for KIDS or easily amused adultsRating 7/10 	5.3	0

Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain.

Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow.

I also liked the opening scene and the scene in which he goes back to 1929 to arrest his partner. maniacal at times.Mia Sara is engaging and looks beautiful as ever.Bruce McGill has some funny bits as Van Dammes Boss.The very sexy Gloria Ruben also shows up as Walkers new partner.Timecop is not the greatest when it comes to plot-holes.But unlike the recent version of HG Wells Time machine, it is a very fun movie.And one of Van Dammes best. set out to achieve...value for your $12.95 whatever. Certainly no cerebral rush, but honest entertainment nonetheless. I rather doubt the Van Damme brigade were looking for some kinda kick-ass Yoda with nunchukas. Hyams delivered his requisite quota of high kicks per dollar and exploding blood capsules per reel.The imdb rating for this film is laughable...it rates a minimum of 6.6! and untrustworthy characters, too many of them. There also is too much Rambo-mentality and the final action goes on way too long. The time travel ange of the story may be intelligent but the dialog in this movie is just plain dumb and too juvenile.Overall, this is one of the best of a small group of well-done Van Damme movies. made a solid attempt at a story, it had decent special effects and sound effects, the acting was as good as van damme gets, and the action was good. Perhaps if he had made a few more of this caliber he might have become a more stable box office draw rather than the queen of straight to video punch-and-kick drivel. 	5.8	0
True Lies (1994)	"on an urban rampage.  This film is a work of genius.  How an action/espionage/romance spoof could deliver such outrageous tongue-in-cheek and yet never feel like corn, slap or déjà vu is a mystery to me.  I give this 8/10 for being relentlessly entertaining, at a very high level.  And the acting is top notch all around. YES!!!The resulting film has Arnie chasing motorcycles on horseback through hotels all the way to ""borrowing"" Harrier jets from the military. And, of course, getting his wife and daughter back.Packed with awesome action scenes and some really terrific hilarious moments this is what an action movie should be. Not too serious and not too pointless. 8/10Rated R: violence and profanity ""wife side track, story-line"" I guess I'm one of the few that doesn't mind it at all and actually find it an extra addition to the story.The movie has everything a good action movie need: A believable action hero, explosions, chases, gun fights, a stereotype villain and a high entertainment value.I wish more action movies like this would be made.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ alternates action with comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger, his partner Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton are hilarious, with very funny liens and situations. Jamie Lee Curtis is not only funny, but also extremely sexy and hot, and I love when she says that she married Rambo. The special effects in the action scenes are stunning. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""True Lies"" Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being ""you're fired!"" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.

When a Man Loves a Woman (1994)	"stated, ""Now HE frustrated me"".  I said, ""I was frustrated too, but BY HER"".  This movie really pegs male and female relationships.Superbly written, superbly acted. It hurts to watch it, but a movie that can evoke real emotion and not pander to the audience with contrived plot lines is a great movie.  THIS is a great movie. if this makes much sense (I feel my thoughts are jumbled).  In one simple statement: SEE THIS MOVIE.  THE TITLE DOES NOT ACCURATELY DISPLAY THE MOVIE IT TRULY IS.  The title makes it sound like another sappy love story.  What the viewer gets is a tremendous study of the damage alcoholism can bring to a family. moving is the wonderfulperformance of the elder child ""Jessie"" - an amazing achievementin one so young. It certainly strengthened my resolve never to godown that path again. I recommend it to all families of alcoholicsfor an insight into our way of thinking - our shame, our inability tocontrol our own addiction, and the possibilty of real recovery.Thank you, all involved. see many reflections of my sister and I in Meg Ryan's daughters.  Both her and Andy Garcia's performances were outstanding.  I would recommend this movie if you have personally dealt with alcholism, or if you have been the victim of someone's abuse, because it helped me come to terms with some issues that I had been struggling with. scene for the 1st time, will definitely fall for it.I`m not going to ""yeap"" about this movie. It is so good(at least I liked it) that I ended up buying it. By now, I have rewatched it a few time and I still didn`t or couldn`t get ""over it"".

Wolf (1994)	"direction, intelligent and wonderfully paced script, with excellent performances from Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Wolf makes a wonderful modern take on the Wolf Man classic right down to the facial prosthetics, and is easily worth seeing for any fans of the genre in the mood for a horror film which refuses to patronise its audience - a very refreshing change. -8/10 doesn't hurt to ogle Michelle Pfeiffer.Even though the profanity is pretty low for a '90s film, when it's there it's needless. They could could have done this movie, believe it or not, without any and it still would have been good. I'm not complaining. I still recommend this, but not for people who are looking for an action--packed vampire film. animal inside like he does. Pfieffer's character is, although formulaic, a relief among all the hard-assed men of this film. The ending is a bit silly, but nonetheless odd and intriguing.Yep.I like this movie. It's fun to watch and it's great to see Nicholson act like the animal we all really think he is but don't dare to find out. it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Lobo"" (""Wolf"") audience is quite small.  Fans of Nicholson's usual drama fare dislike the movie for its horror content, and fans of violent horror dislike the movie because it's lacking in action and gore.  But if you like thoughtful horror that has more brains than blood, you're part of the small group of people who'll get something out of this. "	6.2	0
Wyatt Earp (1994)	"Pullman, Sizemore, Rossellini, Williams and O'Hara.Overall this is a film that requires patience - if you prefer your films to contain action more than story then Tombstone may be more for you - but, for all it's failings, this is still a solid western and a good telling of the legend with more emphasis on background than action and fluidity. Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film. If you're not a stickler like I am for total historical accuracy, you should enjoy the film. low-key, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story, rather than simply showing it to us.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys epic stories, wonderful acting (particularly Dennis Quaid, although Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen are excellent as well), and visually compelling shots. Do not let the length dissuade you: Kasdan's film is well worth the three hours. EARP was a major box office failure when released, and it never achieved the 'Classic' stature TOMBSTONE has, over the years. But it isn't a bad film, and Kasdan should be credited for his willingness to take an original look at a Western legend. It will be interesting to hear his comments, if a 'Director's Cut' DVD is ever released! and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them. This one is no different, and was likely made for a viewer like me, and not the mainstream audience.It's very ambitious, and successful, I believe, on its artistic merits. Whether it's ""entertainment"" for the masses, well that's another story altogether, and that story's name is probably ""Tombstone."" "	6.7	0

Gia Carides has a key supporting role as the judge's mistress who later acts out her part of a woman bent on payback. Remainder of the cast is okay and the tech credits are fine. adds dimension to the movie.Laurence Fishburne, as the cool Nelson Crowe, is a major asset to the picture. So is Ellen Barkin, an actress that is always good to watch and is sadly missed from the screen, as she hasn't made a film in years. Frank Langella, Michael Beach, and above all, Gia Carides, made tremendous contribution to the film. portrayed by Daniel Hugh Kelly.His elegantly evil performance is so deliciously smarmy that it was obviously created for the sole purpose of providing that wicked grin that I spoke of before.If you consider yourself more trip-hop than hip-hop,more Oscar De La Renta than Old Navy,more Paris in the spring than Peoria in the summer,then this is the film for you! Fishburne is excellent as the amoral Crowe, Frank Langella is elegantly nasty as Grimes, and Michael Beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of Fishburne's ""co-workers"". A very dark film that resolves itself quite nicely in the end, and well worth seeing. But if you need a good guy to root for, this isn't the film to check out. "	5.4	0
Man of No Importance, A (1994)	"great period detail and some lovely funny and touching and dark scenes, but the film IS Albert Finney - a momentous performance as a gay man desperate to consummate his passion for a man he knows he cannot have, and desperate also to create beautiful things in a grey, humdrum world which just doesn't understand him. Finney is absolutely fantastic. who are ""bigger than life"", but he can also quite effectively play ordinary people. I recommend the reviewer check out the following films: Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Two for the Road, Charlie Bubbles, The Browning Version, Shoot the Moon, Rich in Love, The Playboys, Erin Brockovich, Gumshoe, The Run of the Country, Endless Game, Picasso Summer, and The Image. once.  All of the acting is very effective, and the story is believable. A rare thing in movies.  This would be a good double bill for 'My Beautiful Laundrette'.  Odd that Indian's present homosexuality believably in English films, but I have never scene an Indian film even portray homosexuality (and, yes, I have seen many Indian films).

The end seems kind of glued to it all, a little sad-a little happy, but more than anything a disappointing meaningless ending for an incomplete movie. Albert Finney and Brenda Fricker deserve much better. is so professional,that you can ""FEEL""Dublin beneath your feet and before your eyes...and the city did feel better back then..before the Celtic Tiger came and went.A bus man in Dublin attempts to eke more out of his hum-drum life,by following his dream of ""the theater""and his life becomes full when he meets so many different characters.This is a must see!

This way, you had to wait until the end of the movie to find out what happened at the beginning. Makes it all the more intriguing.  I love this movie, and most people would too if they gave it half a chance. scathingly commentates on the media's ability to warp and distort truth, and to give the mundane deep meaning. Cliff Spab is a meaningless person trapped in a meaningless society that does not appreciate the horror of his ordeal and ruthlessly tries to cash in on his pain. This film is chock-full of meaning and irony, and it is simply brilliant. throughout this movie amazed me, and I notice something new everytime I watch it.  SFW is based on the book 'Madison Heights Syndrom', and even though I've never read the book, I'm sure they did a great job adapting it.   There was not one thing about this movie I didn't like and would recommend it to everybody. blame the actors for their terrible performances since they had very little to work with from the writing. What I can't believe are the reviewers who rave about this movie. Were we watching the same thing? Were you high? Oh right, given the content, you probably were. Please don't ever waste your time watching this, unless you are contemplating suicide. and although we are led to believe Spab did something spectacular, the later flashbacks reveal why he is unwilling to assume the mantle of hero and why he seems to be in a bad mood most of the time!. A great film that depicts a classic anti-hero with more than adequate back-up from the script and cast. Watch it soon!. 	5.9	0
Low Down Dirty Shame, A (1994)	like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be. equally on both counts. Watch this film, you will not be disappointed. since about 2001.So Samuel Jackson's Shaft gets a x-million dollars promo, and still can't come up with an interesting story (although it was nice to see Richard roundtree on the screen again).Meanwhile, let's talk about entertainment - alright, there are some bits that don't work; but enough do to keep the film moving. I had good time; what the heck. I can't!..the whole movie was a BLAST & if you haven't seen it yet you're wasting time..seriously! It's one of the best films in the comedy/action genre & fans of both individual genres WON'T be disappointed either..so if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favour & check it out you won't regret it! 10 out of 10 stars! sequences and stick a lot of funny s*** along the way.  Jada Pinkett lives up to comedic expectations as the sexy but tough assistant to Shame as Peaches.  It's a good action-comedy to rent, but put the kids to bed before you watch it.

Don't miss it. technique merged with an excellent art direction which brings you back to the ""classic era"" with the Greek beauty patterns.The puppets are extremely well sculpted and the movie presents itself like an ancient arena theater, with great light/shadow effects and of course, Greek drama. All of this combined makes Achilles one of the most charming short movies I've ever seen. and his relationship with his lover, Petroclus, during the trojan war. The scenes are played out through montage as well as action sequences and tableaus, culminating in the untimely deaths of the two heroes. Never before has an historical homosexual relationship been so delicately portrayed without prejudice or judgement. Considering this is animation, that is a tremendous feat. Astonishing stuff! fight. angry, pain, revenge, the apotheotic end. the temptation to see it again and again is not small. because the director has the gift to resurrect the Greece who you only imagine in the history class as answer to the words of Homer.and your images from the youth become alive in delicate, splendid manner. so, a film as time trip.

And then try to sleep well that night... the morality of his choice of renunciation)--white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco--over the riches he leaves to his wife, and her and society's dishonor.

Derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst of people he says to Chabert when he takes the case. This speech's original place is at the end of the novella as Balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony. really of value in life. My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy, wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family. Somehow that artifice makes the film a bit less emotionally powerful than it might be. But I'd certainly see it again. "	7.0	0
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965)	"fills the screen with sharp dialogue (""Breast or thigh, darlin'?"") and sharp camerawork. There is no nudity, since Meyer was trying to circumvent the censors in 1966, but there are some incredibly sexy scenes all the same. Excitement and laughs abound in this straight-faced send-up of action-flick conventions. This celebrated cult classic is one big-breasted Gothic melodrama-satire that really...um...stands out! single unforgettable mythic figure. Similarly the vastly underrated Stuart Lancaster is the very personification of sleazy misogyny. Add to this the brilliant build-up of the opening monologue, Meyer's masterful editing and Jack Moran's eminently quotable and often hilariously funny camp dialogue and you have a trash film masterpiece that just gets better and better the more times you watch it. and entertaining movies made in the 1960s, and continues to amuse and inspire right into the 21st Century. Every time I watch this movie I am knocked out. This is a bona fide cult classic that gets better and better as the years go by. Absolutely essential viewing for anyone who loves exploitation movies, The Sixties, rock'n'roll and/or buxom babes! the leads will always make it memorable; the fact that they've got big breasts only makes that more so. This is an absolute cult classic and, I suspect, a film that I'll be seeing over and over again. This is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed - so make sure you don't miss it! taken in the right way the combination of trailer-park chic, retro-hysteria, and ultra-attitude is a lot of fun... and when the pussycats hit the screen you may think you're about to get a black eye, and I don't mean from their fists!

Unforgettable.Highly recommended, but keep in mind that there is grit, drugs and depictions of violence in this movie. give electrifying performances. One of the strongest issues the film dealt with was Payne's relationship as a brother to troubled Woodbine. The disturbing part for me though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his family.A brilliant film, I can't recommend this film enough. 8/10 that happen. The characters are very well developed and, while the movie doesn't justify Josh's actions, it does convey compassion for him. It also provides new insight on what it's really like to live in a ghetto. If you can find this movie (after all, I saw it on Showtime and haven't the video in any stores) totally see it!!!! cast shine. film enhanced the whole. ""Jason"" gave me hope that a man can commit in a relationship; he just has to want to do it.  He made me dream again of lovely words and warm embraces.

The characters don't really speak so much as mumble, which, along with the jerky motion, adds to the un-ease.All in all, this movie stands right up there with David Lynch and Jan Svankmajer films as a twisted masterpiece. had the chance to see this excellent piece of animation and I truly enjoyed it. For all those interested in clay/latex animation (Aardman style) the s/fx are awesome.As for the storytelling: absolutely wicked !

I was also moved by Tom's innocence and non-judgemental nature, despite the horrors and tragedies that surrounded him. are jerky and clumsy, and the clay-mation is smooth and fluid.

My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Ventos do Deserto' ('Desert Winds') Heather Graham were never uninteresting to watch and listen to as they tentatively revealed themselves to each other across a huge chasm.  The whole idea and concept was intriguing.  While Nickles still has a way to go as a writer, he clearly is on his way there and I will definitely be interested in whatever else he does. thought the movie was OK. It had themes about following your heart and desires and encouraging others to do the same. I also thought it was too slow in some places, but that wasn't too bad. It had nice touches of romance and good conversations between the too leads. It was a decent movie at best.** 1/2 out of **** agree with the other poster's comment that it allowed the two principal characters to develop an intimacy that would have been unlikely otherwise.Those looking for plot development or action needn't bother.  This is a study of two characters and how they get to know each other in an unusual way.  It's a nice alternative to most Hollywood crap.  The rest of the movie consists of a couple of dreary sex scenes (no, Heather is not included) and Graham and Nickles having short supposedly meaningful conversations with their parents.   While I find Ms. Graham as alluring as the next guy, I suspect most viewers, like me, will find this movie a handy nonchemical substitute for Sominex. 	5.8	0

Better than Chasers and Under Siege. McNamara is much better in this than he was in Chasers, where he played a Tom Cruise wannabe. In this these to are a couple, who've just met, on the lam.

Homage (1995)	"work?""Homage"" is an interesting drama, with a story in he style of a documentary with the incident disclosed in the beginning, flashbacks and the persons involved interviewed along the film. The conclusion with the vigilante act of a correct police officer shows how people do not believe in the justice system.

A chilling insightful movie about people either trying to find themselves or run away into fantasy.

Mirage (1995)	with it. Even a decent performance from Edward James Olmos, who I've never really cared much for. The rest of the cast was utterly forgettable. They badly needed a better actor to play Lt. Randazzo. Decent photography and evocation of the Coachella Valley. Overall, it's worth checking out on cable if you like Sean Young. Otherwise, skip it. Grade: C- a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions. Young is better, but still a poor substitute for Kim Novak. 	5.0	0

Federal Hill (1994)	"seen it yet.... rent it.. buy it.. watch it.. get some haven brothers and watch it.... I had a lot of laughs watching these guys run around the state to places that I can relate to... everything from food spots to night clubs.. I love the scene when Nicky cooks for his girlfriend.. really funny.. it reminds me of myself.. originality within his compositions, while he is able to make something fresh with use of closeups. A feeling is generated that the Federal Hill district has its distinctive persona, and incisive dialogue binds a viewer's attention to Ralphie and Nicky's widely variable states of mind in a film that carves a niche for its cinematic métier and for its director. a Mean Streets copy but this is smarter than that and while painting a convincing community it delivers a couple of characters that are more complex than they appear and hold the interest as a result. The performances mainly do what is required but a couple are better than that  in particular a layered delivery from Turturro as Ralph. gay! Take a good look at the relationship between Raplph and Nicky while you watch the film. I believe Ralph seems prejudice towards gay people to hide the fact that he is. An excellent independent film, Federal Hill was shot in Providence, Rhode Island. Good acting, great direction, and a powerful story, It is one of Nicholas Turturro's best performances. okay. I never thought about Nicky and Ralphy's relationship and you are right, now I think about it, Ralph seem very jealous of Nicky's relationship with a woman. A lot foul language and tough acts throughout the film...typical of hoodlum type of movies. I like to get the ""run you away"" theme song of the movie...can't seem to find it. "	6.3	0

At times the film can be extremely scary. The old trick of using darkness and shadows to convey creepiness that Carpenter's so good at are present and good as ever. ""In the mouth of madness"" pulled all the right strings and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.8/10.Oh, and great ending. in a sea of un-reality.  Julie Carmen is also very good in her role.  Look for Charlton Heston as a publisher and Bernie Casey in a cameo as well.  Kudos to Mr. Carpenter for bringing his visions of horror to the silver screen once again.  This may be his best film...certainly his most thought-provoking and sophisticated. the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter.The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10. great as I find this movie petrifying.The production of the film isn't great and there are more exciting films out there. But if you have some imagination, are a little romantic and like being scared without having to sit through some poor soul forced to spectate live at their own autopsy, then this deserves every one of its eight stars.

8 Seconds (1994)	job of playing Lane Frost. While it is not entirely factual, it does give a fairly accurate description of life in the rodeo. This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. If you don't like bulls, dirt, and the cowboy way..... don't rent this movie. However it is a must see for any rodeo fan. as a sport with the formation of the Professional Bull Riders. It's champion in 1995 was none other than Tuff Hedeman. And in 1996 Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost with both inducted in the PBR Ring of Honor, the equivalent of their Hall of Fame. It's a good biographical picture and should have gotten much more attention than it did. is a nice film to watch with the family. I suppose if you cannot connect with the American West, or horses, or rodeos, you may want to leave this film alone, but otherwise it is a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood car chases, gun fights, sex and cheap jokes.My hat comes off to Lane Frost, a person to admire. was actually quite good. The story of ill-fated bullrider Lane Frost met my expectations and featured just the right amount of romance, drama, rodeo scenes, action, tear-jerking scenes, and country singer cameos to suit most needs. I liked Luke Perry's performance, and Cynthia Geary's wasn't bad. If you see this, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.*** out of **** Oklahoma bull rider Lane Frost. Hard work and faith led to winning the 1987 PRCA Bull Riding World Championship before rodeo finally took his young life. Perry is very believable leading the cast that also features:Cynthia Geary, Stephen Baldwin and Red Mitchell. Some country dance tunes by Brooks & Dunn and Vince Gill. Worthwhile and recommended for the whole family. 	6.5	0

There were other former R&B stars who starred in the movie but only had small parts. To wrap it up in a nutshell Above the rim to me is one of the most memorable urban basketball movies I've ever saw. features Duane Martin, Tonya Pinkins,Marlon Wayans,Bernie Mac,Leon and the late great rapper/actor Tupac Shakur(2Pac). Here you can see why Tupac was highly respected not only as a celebrated gangsta rapper,but also a great actor with an impaccable skill and broad range and here in this movie you see why. A film that is not to be missed. Rating:***** five stars. movies in this genre,and this movie also contains some real cool basketball scenes. are celebrated a lot more in the black community than anywhere else.

Still, it's got a lot of action packed exciting basketball scenes in it. While it's not a basketball movie, any fan of basketball should enjoy it.Overall it's a good movie.

I doubt anyone else could play the part of ""the black widow"" quite as well, with just the right mix of sleaze and slapstick. Her deranged laughter alone is worth half the rental fee.It may not be a classic but it is solid entertainment, with few if any weak passages. Go and see it! front-row seat. Peter MacNichol (Ally McBeal) and Christine Baranski (The Ref) have a ball as the irritating summer camp counslers and Christina Ricci will probably never top her performance as Wednesday.It's a guilty pleasure and a fun ride, zipping by in an hour and a half and also features a hilarious cameo by Peter Graves (Airplane).  Check it out! UK, as it is how much of the States is perceived over here.Also, Amanda in this movie, is also played by the same girl who played the Girl Scout in the first movie.Add a little bit of romance between Wednesday and another kid at the camp and you have something for everyone in this wonderfully funny and worryingly endearing movie.

You So Crazy (1994)	is essentially perfect in this. Clearly there was some conscious thought in this, and some professional writers. But it all revolves around intuitive timing.I dare you to watch the two comics one after another. One is demeaning, the other intelligent and enobling.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life. he goes all out and is totally RAW and UNCENSORED (as you can tell because of the NC-17 rating).  If you're chillin with a bunch of friends and you're looking to laugh your ass off, then this one will definitely do it for you. Check it out, but don't expect Blockbuster or Hollywood video to carry this 'bad boy'. man should hide when the police are looking for him.With that said, the second half of the film is where it pretty much starts to stumble. The laughs really do dry up and I think the concert film really drags on to the point where it gets really boring. The film probably would have been better as a hour special. by storm. Martin is one of the only comedians that really makes me laugh. He's funny in shows and stand up. The way he brings humor to racism is just super funny, especially when he imitates stereotypes of different races including his own. There was not a boring moment during this stand up and I laughed all the way through. all know Martin Lawrence for movies like NOTHING TO LOSE,BLUE STREAK,WILD HOGS,etc.In 1994 he conducted this hilarious stand-up comedy in the way that came as a shock to everyone, I mean almost everybody liked it.In this program he makes fun of White people and talks a lot about Racism,Relationship between girlfriends and boyfriends,the destructive influence of drugs and so on. 	6.7	0

The soundtrack rocks and the laughs come so often (very dumb laughs) that it's impossible to keep count.  Enjoy. heard when it came out that it bombed. I don't see how (What do critics know?). If you're one of those people who take their comedies too seriously, go read Dickens. But if you want to see a funny movie, rent this. Everyone in this is good. The plot is good. The acting is good. It's just a good movie. much!I don't think that anybody that ever was in a Rock-Roll band could watch this movie without cracking up. I guess maybe you had to be there?

This is a classic Rock-n-Roll comedy that you must see. bitch, and so works so well as that. The jokes keep going thru-out, and are actually funny, even after repeated viewings.

Air Up There, The (1994)	"note in the whole story was the misuse of the quotes from Quran which really had no point or place or meaning in the story. It just perplexed me. It sticks out with a pointlessness in an otherwise heart warming story. The ""Bismillah"" was beautiful but out of another time and culture and milieu, and still leaves me wondering (?) (technically) a sports drama, it really lends something to the whole affair that can put you in a good mood every time you watch it. I'm sure part of this is Maina's performance, which is so sweet you can't help but like it -- this is coming from a usually-cynical moviegoer who dislikes ""sappy"" movies.All in all, it's a charmer. wants to bring back to America.Both Mr. Bacon and Charles Gitonga Maina, who plays Saleh, have an easy time together bonding in a hostile environment. Their inter action makes the film enjoyable. Also, the mostly unknown supporting cast compliment the movie.Granted, this is a film to watch only for entertainment and to enjoy Kevin Bacon at his most charming self. back in the States. The adventures of the trip pretty much are the story.One negative: another irreverent slam to get a few cheap laughs at the Catholic church. A nun in here uses profanity and gives Bacon a big kiss on the lips. It's one more example of trying to make clerical people appear worldly like the rest of us. successive watching, as I continue to find noteworthy facets every time).In summation, I implore you to do yourself a favor: the next time you're feeling depressed, inadequate, or entirely stressed, rent or buy this movie, and watch it.

Another Stakeout (1993)	"comments about the filming having been done on an island in Puget Sound. A lot was shot in Seattle, but the majority was on Bowen Island - I should know - I was living there at the time. Just thought I'd set the record straight. (You can see the homes used for filming clearly on Google Earth, if you're interested.) I've seen a storyline like this in a story about cops. So that was very refreshing for me. Richard Dreyfuss and Emelio Estevez... A duo that you wouldn't expect to see on film... But wow... Total chemistry!! Line after line was just gold for me. I highly recommend this movie. I've told all my friends about it and they agree. violence, language, nudity, and humor. I'm not saying a movie has to be R to be funny. But if you've got a sequel to an R-rated movie like ""Stakeout"" and you decide to turn its sequel into a cutesy-tutesy children's entertainment program, you'd better advise the audience before they sit down expecting something funny and fresh.What a disappointment.2/5 stars.John Ulmer his gun has been replaced by a dead fish. This is not a serious movie. It's a fun one.In the first movie, Badham's taut direction and thrilling action sequences took center stage.

Bad Girls (1994)	"like Barrymore's bosom.It is not what I would call a smart film, however it does present itself as an interesting fable about the empowerment of women by women who remain women. I would liken Bad Girls to that of the Freudian dreams of those who struggle against ""the man."" I feel that it deserves to be seen at least once. and gave rise to Girl Power credence.  I couldn't take my eyes off Barrymore who had come a long since E.T. and her drug/alcohol fuelled periods of teen angst/pain.  The fight at the end in the corral blew me away, those  girls proved they could outshoot anything on two legs!!!There should be a sequel!!!4 out of 5 this movie that transcends the gender of it's hero. Make no mistake about it this is Stowe's movie to win or lose and she comes away having broke the bank at Monte Carlo. See it with open eyes if you like westerns. If you don't see something else as this will surely disappoint. It is a western all the way. The story line may not be totally accurate from a historical standpoint but the action and acting are good and more than make up for whatever may be wrong. For me the story was more about the relationship that existed between the four girls without going over the line and making it sexual. For me, Bad Girls was a winner. is a story of the depth of friendship, strength, starting over, finding love and fighting back. Who said women can't kick some butt. A real feel good movie that is great to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I would recommend adding this movie to one's movie collection. This is one movie where women are the heroes of the movie.

Still, it's hard to argue with an ending that has Montserrat bite into an authentic American hamburger and pronounce it ""incredible."" At least unless you're a vegetarian, in which case Fred would probably say that's your problem.] a relatively minor supporting role.The film is effectively a celebration of Barcelona and also of the situations that arise when different cultures meet. This might make it hard for some Americans to warm to but, ironically, that merely underlines the movie's main theme - that the world is bigger than the American continent and infinitely wider in its cultural scope. chosen professions. This doesn't sound like much, but it's really a hoot. The movie's core is the pair's verbal jousting, both with one another, and with the Spanish women they try to woo. It has a couple of sub-plots to keep things interesting, and just bubbles along. I recommend this highly, especially as a movie to see with a date. and fireworks at night. There is much charming, often subtle, humor in the film. Who could resist Taylor Nichols dancing alone in his dining room while reading the Bible? Or Chris Eigeman using a felt tip pen to change anti-American graffiti from ""American pigs"" to ""American deer""? Sure, the film is talky, but it doesn't take itself too too seriously. there are about 5 female characters who are easy to confuse. Do see it- you'll enjoy it.

Beverly Hillbillies, The (1993)	"Jed Clampett protects and cares for not only his daughter, but his nephew and mother-in-law, the latter two a constant challenge to Jed's patience, which he never loses. If there were more Jed Clampetts in this world, then maybe we'd all be living in shacks, but at least we'd be getting along with each other and treating each other better. blatant materialism. Every viewer realizes that, despite all the absurdity and the utterly ridiculous scenarios, the Clampetts know exactly what's important in life and that this family of uprooted hillbillies has a real life lesson to teach us all.If only there were more TV shows like it today! Alas, our society has become far too sophisticated for its own good. each other (and off the Clampetts) were side-splitting. Drysdale and Hathaway were a major factor in the show's success. I agree with someone else who commented that Irene Ryan should be up there in the same class with Lucille Ball. It's tragic that her name is all but forgotten today. But Granny lives on in the hearts of her fans. up her doctoring bag and charge full steam ahead to cure whoever might be ailing. From childhood to this day, I never seem to tire from watching this show. I can't say that about many others. Perhaps the Western series, ""Bonanza"", is one other that comes to mind. In both shows the characters own personalities forge their way into immortality. world. Again, they're simply being themselves. Maybe it helped that Irene Ryan was from Texas, Donna Douglas was from Louisiana, and Buddy Ebsen was from rural Illinois. I guess Max Baer was just a natural as Jethro, and he later dwelt on mainly Southern themes in his post-Jethro life as a film producer. PC or not, the show is funny!! "	7.2	0
Beverly Hills Cop III (1994)	"may be fair comments, but the film is still better than given credit for.Maybe not as funny as the first two, and maybe Murphy is more toned down, but there is still plenty of fun here from Bronson Pichot and others... not to mention an overall decent script. Even just trying to identify the director cameos is a fun game. Rick Avery, John Singleton,Ray Harryhausen, George Schaeffer, Joe Dante, among them. Catching music with again the international hit smash by Harol Faltermeyer.Glimmer and colorful cinematography by Marc Alhberg.The motion picture is regularly directed by John Landis because it contains some flaws and gaps. The picture will appeal to unstopped action buffs and Eddie Murphy fans. Rating : Average though amusing. and Tim Carhart was great as Eddie Willows on CSI. Seemed very forced at times, and definitely lacked the Foley-Rosewood-Taggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as ""Serge"" was painful to watch.5 out of 10, based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else. for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still, it's a very good series. such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin or Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan. "	5.5	0

It will not go down in the Hollywood hall of fame, nor will it be recollected by high and mighty of movie making.

Their are several bits in the film that will amuse even young children and even my son who is not yet two enjoys watching Black Beauty running with his friends Ginger and Merry-legs.The bottom line is if you love animals at all, especially horses, then you will completely adore this film. Anna Sewell's wonderful book, and the beautiful scenery and music enhance the story of Black Beauty's adventures with his friends.

Blown Away (1994)	"is good but never truly called on to do anything special. Amis, Whitaker and the rest of the support are perhaps a little under-used but the film is never about them. This is about Jones and Bridges in a deadly, vengeful face-off and the final showdown is everything you could ever want from an action thriller. Watch it and enjoy. slight lead to Blown Away however, for better acting and storyline. Another comparison would be Arlington Road, same type of story and Jeff Bridges. Explosions in this movie look real and are real, not computer animated. They look so real you can almost feel the heat on your face :) A definite must see if you like Action-Thriller genre movies I suspect this well done sequence is what is making many people call this film ""slow.""Finally, the use of ""The Joshua Tree"" by U2 was a really nice touch. Overall, this film is not outstanding, but if you want a movie that is relatively light, but has some comedy, drama, suspense and action all mixed in, then check it out. a contrived story in spots, particularly at the end when the fight between Bridges and Jones goes on forever as does the scene with Jones trying to save his wife. It's just too much. A lot of modern-day action films just don't know when to quit, and this is a prime example. Yet, it's definitely worth at least one look. On the MGM DVD the picture is a clear anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen with super good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, thus packing a punch for you home theater system.Overall, solid entertainment, you're not looking for anything like To Kill A Mockingbird, now are you?

Blue Chips (1994)	O'Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt Nover do surprisingly well with the material.  They are all three-dimensional characters and shine throughout the film.  However with that said, it is Nick Nolte who is the primary factor that makes the film well worth while.  Far from perfect, but still a very good movie.  4 out of 5 stars. and always has in much of college sports. I don't care for sports! But I loved this film. The ratings this film gets on here really ticks me off, what is it, a 5.5 star average? I've learned one thing on here and other review sites, if you let others judge for you, you'll miss a lot of good movies. McDonnell, Walsh, Woodard and the real players of Shaq and Penny do OK.  The cast is also filled out with plenty of coaches, commentators and such from real life  so there's plenty to see.Overall this is one of my favourite basketball movies simply because it tells it like it is  even if it does have it's weaknesses. sports fan would enjoy watching this movie. As a University of Kentucky basketball fan, I enjoyed seeing Bobby Knight get a little mad!!! Pete Bell was a man with a lot on his mind and finally realized that his career had gone far away from what basketball and sports should be...having fun! I really wish this DVD would be released!!! the role. This entire film tries to hard, accentuating points too harshly, and showing how corrupt the entire system in a manner that doesn't appear believable. I will say this, Nick Nolte really embodies the uber-Bobby Knight character, and what happened to Matt Nover? He was clearly the only good actor amongst all of the basketball players in the film. 	6.1	0

And Boothe does very well as the rat.But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky the main story is their troubled relationship, and how through good, bad and worse they get through it with each other's support.  Jessica Lange's performance as an unstable woman was amazing, not over the top in which it would have been typically done, but was portrayed truely and its fine nuance conveyed the subtle change in her mental state. that. Its inability to get released is a bit of a mystery though.  I mean a film with Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones should have no trouble being released in my mind.  Anyhow, this is Jessica Lange's greatest role.  Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe also give great supporting turns.  4 out of 5 stars. the plot is a little implausible- just like David sent off Bathsheba's husband to certain death- to seduce her- the army didn't reckon with the power of a strong and slightly crazy woman.  The teenagers in the film add to its poignancy.  On the surface the Marshall family seems dysfunctional- but actually- with love they function very well. for her performance. She deserved every win in a movie that was a testament to love. No matter how crazy, Major Marshall (Jones) was there for her because of his love.

Body Snatchers (1993)	"the teacher seems to want to punish him for being different). This is a spine-chilling, absolutely terrific little picture - but even if it wasn't, it would still be worth seeing just for Meg Tilly's exceptional performance - her ""where are you gonna go?"" monologue is as scary as anything in say, ""Psycho"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"".    (***1/2) watched and not compared.  In it's own right it is a good horror with only a few weaknesses that spoil it slightly.  And if you do want to compare it to the 50's version then please remember than this is the type of ending that Siegel wanted and to me is one of the strengths of this film. ever since his outstanding performance in Full Metal Jacket but what the heck. He's brilliant every single time. In conclusion, Body Snatchers contains a few very bloody and explicit sequences so horror fans won't be disappointed completely. It could have been a lot better, that's a fact. But on the other hand..it could have been a lot worse as well. concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people .

Boxing Helena (1993)	"is no resolution of the problem. Once you've gotten the basics though, it's fascinating to see how elegantly and delicately this psycho-deviation is treated. Nothing is superfluous, and everything fits. Even the ""dream"", which is part fantasy, part reality, part prophecy. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is very well done. See it again with the correct perspective. sick and obsessive male fantasy, make you almost believe it is OK, and then at the end you look at what you have accepted and realise it for what it is.Boxing Helena is not comfortable watching, but I think a brilliant and involved portrayal of how people(men generally) justify and accept the most controlling acts and confuse them with love. the extreme reaches of human eroticism. Suspense driven it takes the rider thru dreams and reality never quite allowing you to tell which is which until the very end. If you only enjoy movies with well defined good and evil you might find this an uncomfortable journey but for the adventurous soul rest assured, it is a journey worth taking. with original star Kim Basinger got in director Jennifer Lynch's way. In any event, Lynch hasn't been given the chance to purge this demon from her resume...one look at it and you'll know why. It's a curious mix of sex, fantasy and horror, but so perplexing and muddled, the provocative angle of the whole scenario gets lost. *1/2 from **** feel toward relations in today's society.  The depth of feeling, as well as the ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes really are great.  Maybe ""being male"" I am already emotionally retarded, so the absorption time for the movie's really great statements were meant to be.  Either way, this movie is definitely worth every thinking person's time. "	4.6	0
Bronx Tale, A (1993)	"to pick it up!  This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.  A film like this really deserves more recognition.And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of ""thank yous"" to your buddy Scorcese.  He's taught you well.My score:  A perfect 10! (out of 10)  De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn't want to repeat anything, so he viewed Scorsese's mobster trilogy to see what already had been done. It's obvious he paid attention.Even De Niro himself knows a little Italy gangster film is not complete with at least a surprise-ending cameo from you know who... smart as they come, but even with all that can't anticipate all contingencies.Lillo Brancato who went on to several other film roles and a long running one in The Sopranos certainly in real life didn't make the same choices as his character Calogero Anello did. Life really imitated art in his life story.Nice to see the Bronx get its due. scene) there isn't anything graphic (certainly not on the scale of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan!) and no nudity, just a good story. One of the gems is that nothing is sadder than wasted talent. Thank God that Mr. Palmenteri didn't waste his and shared this wonderful story with all of us. Unforgettable movie, a definite 10 out of 10! Niro's first directing job.  Directing is hard work, acting is hard work, to act in your first directing effort is...incredible. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Look at the kind of actor he is.  Great film, don't miss it, but please don't wait for the special effects. This is one film that doesn't need them to captivate you. 10/10 "	7.8	1
Cabin Boy (1994)	"punch him in the face, and gently rock him to sleep in a comfy blanket. This comedy is probably not for everyone, but the payoff for those who understand its naive, cynical hilarity is worth the rental fee. Hell, you can buy it for under six bucks almost any where. It is truly a misunderstood work of pure cinematic bliss. often lament ChrisElliott's underrated genius and dream of the day when Cabin Boy takes itsrightful place in film history as a classic. Hard to believe its already been ten years since its release and I still crack up every time I watch it. Only thing that could top it would be a sequel -- Passion of the Cabin Boy, perhaps? this movie a lot because of scenes that are actually in Get A Life, Chris Elliot's TV show. And that's not really fair. But that episode where Martin Mull comes over and they go to that brothel while they play ""Afternoon Delight?"" That was so funny that it kind of bleeds over into Cabin Boy and makes that funny too. for what it was it was really funny, with a lot of laugh out loud gut busting moments. David Letterman's ""wanna buy a monkey?"" cameo is fantastic and Chris Elliott is great as the full of himself, super annoying rich kid turned cabin boy. I really recommend it if you like any of his other work or Get A Life. and I laughed the whole way through. Summary: Unfortunately, people can't make a movie that trashes your run of the mill critic, and still hope for a good review. If you are a critic know it all, you'll hate ""Cabin Boy"". If you have an actual sense of humor you'll love it.Happiness guaranteed: That's what cabin boy is to me. "	5.2	0

Jerry O'Connel plays again as the poor little fool dominated by his friends (do you remember ""Stand by me""?) & the other guy, Gabriel Olds (sorry but, who is he?

(No not all of his films are good, but he's good in all of them).  It's a movie you don't think you'll want to watch and 15 minutes in, you want to watch the whole thing.  Enjoyable, very quotable, and about what every man dreams of-meeting Marilyn Monroe. "	5.0	0

Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made.

And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.Anyways, i give this movie 10/10 performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life (I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady, but as i said, this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves). All in all, Is a great movie, and personally, one of my all time favorites (if not favorite). Great Performances, Perfect Film. must endure when trying to escape his violent past.  Stephen Burum's nearly flawless camerawork and DePalma's flamboyant and operatic direction are a visual splendor that complements the emotional story.  This film is a highly underrated work of art that needs to be appreciated.  Great supporting performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller should not go unmentioned. Pacino's on screen presence and experienced acting mannerisms. Penn, once again is brilliant and shines through as the high-classed, cocaine addicted Kleinfeld.

Jon Lovitz is awesome!It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :. his clueless buddies Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz and the unnecessary profanity by Jack Palance.All the characters, however, are definitely fun to watch and there is a good message in the end about sacrificing for friends and relatives. The story also features a very neat twist at the end. This is a film you can laugh at with multiple viewings. of dollars in gold? I won't say what went wrong in their quest, but they did get to be really, really happy at one point, and that was satisfying.The real gold here was Duke's telling of his life story, and the guys working together despite incredible odds.  This was probably as good as the first movie for those reasons. Oscar magic isn't there and I couldn't help feel he took away from his original role somewhat.Overall this is amusing at best but really pales against the original (which wasn't a classic itself).  The action isn't up to much and the comedy only delivers a few laughs, preferring instead to retread as many of the original's jokes as possible. avid moviegoer I had to sit thru this crap and expected to be as entertained like I was with the original film(which was a gem). All I can say is that the movie studio heads saw the $$$$$ the original made and thinking that another one would profit just as much,regardless if the script was good at all or not. "	5.5	0

A guy who loses his memory every night allows for some great comedic possibilities and the movie delivers. Dana Carvey is such a funny actor. I'd love to see him get more starring opportunities. Also great in this movie is the dog. This is a fantastic comedy. Anyone should enjoy it and laugh a lot. much? This movie is definitely worth watching. might have been casting. Carvey looks like anything but a hard-boiled detective. Also, although I did laugh at some things, we have a modern-day comedy more needless sexual innuendos, sado-masochism offered and the like. Why? If you have a good comedian and a good story, you don't need that garbage. I think most Carvey fans were disappointed with this film. guy. He does not seem like the Hollywood type. I think he is highly underrated and I hope he can find his niche again. Clean Slate is the comedy version of Memento, or Memento is the serious version of Clean Slate. I heard that Adam Sandler was producing a script Dan Carvey wrote, so I hope something comes of that. 	5.7	0

It is die hard movie in the mountains.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. It is way to underrated and it is my personal favorite Stallone action movie. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. **** the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money... With breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, ""Cliffhanger"" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie... the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10 "	6.4	0
Coneheads (1993)	"card and whole new identity. There is so much to take in here and a lot of talented comedians are seen to good advantage, whether in starring or cameo roles. CONEHEADS is one of the most underrated comedies of the 90's which I don't think ever got the credit it deserved. If you've never seen it, definitely worth the rental. expect to see more of her in the future. On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised. players throughout the movie and they are pretty well integrated (i.e., they usually don't seem like tacked on cameos but fit within the plot). Also, although I generally hate David Spade, his annoying personality fits in perfectly with the character he plays.This is a good film for the whole family. It's cute, funny and actually has amazingly good family values! head over heels in love with Ronnie (Farley) a local mechanic and neighborhood boy who admits to never have dated a girl taller than him before. Coneheads is a great family comedy with tons of laughs from start to finish , Chris Farley 29, & Michelle Burke 23, play the star crossed teenage couple with humor and warmth 8/10 Stars I love the creativity of the story line. From screaming at the bowling pins and eggplants to rigging the pop machine to get ""silver tender disks"" to pay for the motel room.

Color of Night (1994)	`you Daffodils!' to see him naked here! And Jane March is stunning, also naked. Beautiful sex-scenes and nicely edited. The film has a nice chase too, a Mercedes SL against a Camaro or Trans Am.Advice: see this film and judge for yourself! (and write it down here!) Switch your senses off and just let yourself be entertained. You'll see, you'll like it! any and all credibility it may have initially contained, and Rush took it from there, taking `Color of Night' straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise.  It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one; once the magic is lost, it's hard to retrieve. 2/10. fun to re-watch. you do take yourself that seriously, get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20% that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime (that's just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher), don't take yourself so seriously.

Cops and Robbersons (1994)	"and Dad can't get a bagel without cream cheese on it. The cops are standard film cops except that Jack Palance is even more overpowering than usual.

Lampoon (Animal House) but it does follow in the same vein as the ""Vacation"" movies though. Chevy and Dianne made a great couple and have a great sense of timing that is so important to a good comedy. Chevy's character similar to ""Vacation"" develops from an disrespected head of the house to a respected Father. Don't pass this one by. film you get, In the good way. It's charming, with hitchcockian mystery music, it's well played, an it's funny without full of foul language, being harassing or embarrassing the wrong way, like many comedies do now.This is plain funny, with stupid persons, which is all quite lovable. In style of ""Dumb and dumber"" I recommend this for the whole family. as ever. For that matter, I really don't see how somebody that likes the Vacation movies could dislike this film. It's pretty much the same family, only they don't go on vacation. They have some cops come live with them and comedy ensues.Anybody who gives this movie less than a 6/10 needs to pull the stick out of their rectum. Slickers and Chevy Chase plays stupid extremely well because for one thing, he's become so used to it in real life. This is definitely the last thing he ever did that's worth watching. Robert Davi is also perfect in the bad guy next-door role. It's a family friendly comedy that doesn't rely on profanity or toilet humor for a laugh. "	5.0	0

Oh My!If you like a movie where the ending is not black and white you'll enjoy Dangerous Game. doesn't know what he'll do with the film, or how to finish it, and this sort of abrupt ending leaves the actors as well as the film in the cold. But as a film about film-making, I've seen worse, and I might even like it more if I catch it late one night on cable (definitely *that* kind of movie). Okay, now I'm ranting, but isn't funny how men are especially really down with the NeoFeminist Bull about how it's actually empowering for women to exploit themselves.) Ferrara plays with the autobiographical nature of the subject matter. The plot centers on a film director who compartmentalizes his personal and professional life, until the secrets of his professional life overwhelm him. it is even better than Evita.  The way the movie is set up is also interesting, crossing between a the story, scenes from the film in the story, and a documentary about the film within the story.  Yet, the set up isn't confusing at all. I would consider it one of my favourite movies along with Madonna's best. 	5.7	0
Dave (1993)	"also has a great deal of drama which keeps the audience intrigued throughout.  Frank Langella does some of the best work of his career.  Sigourney Weaver, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin, and Ben Kingsley are all perfectly cast in supporting roles.  The screenplay is smart and the direction never loses its focus.  4.5 out of 5 stars. direction is nothing special but succeeds in telling the story with humour and sadness that very often the people who get the top job have so little knowledge of the people at the bottom to make any significant change in society.First rate, and far better than the IMDb rating suggests. Also watch out for a great end gag. Top drawer. He was superb.To those who may say that ""Dave"" doesn't give a true reflection on American politics or make a political statement, I would agree with them, but then it surely didn't mean to. Its just a charming little comedy and/or love story that's easy on mind and eye, and for what its worth I thought it was great...so there! I realize that cynicism can easily get in the way of just enjoying a movie for what it is.Kevin Kline is terrific and so is the rest of the cast. Also, the insertion of so many real politicians and pundits playing themselves adds a nice touch. I thoroughly recommend this movie! I could give it no less than a 10. is what gave the movie a sense of realism. Finally, Reitman helps the audience fall for the plot. He makes it so believable, honest and true. In the end, the audience will realize that politics will not mend our nation, but rather honest people will. In any case of all the movies about the President, this is the best one. "	6.8	0

Richard Linklater gives a great independent direction. This isn't a film that encourages kids to do drugs, but it shows a true portrayal of teenagers in a America, in a very fun way.

The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment. the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.Two thumbs down. viable form beyond the book?

Fatal Instinct (1993)	"Assanti was a real serious actor and he wouldn't be funny but 5 minutes in to it when he put that hot dog in his jacket pocket I didn't stop laughing. Since then I've seen this movie so many time and I laugh just as hard as the first time. If you want a real good laugh get this one. Nelligan, Sean Young and Christopher McDonald add to the fun. To be frank, I enjoyed this more on the first viewing than I did on the second. After watching it twice, I thought the film would have been better had it been cut 10-15 minutes, and it's only 90 minutes. However, I am not knocking it: it's a fun movie. above similar efforts is the brilliant performance from Armand Assante, who displays a comic timing that I never would have guessed he had. He plays his completely oblivious-to-everything-that's-happening-around-him detective with such dead pan seriousness, that it's impossible not to laugh (the scenes with his skunk little Neddy are hilarious). Never mind the critics, find this film and see it. [8/10] character seems to love. Sherilyn Fenn is the loyal secretary Laura.

The personal conflict of each character is the heart of this exceptional movie... film, in its wide-screen splendor.  From what I understand, the shorter versions released internationally deleted and shortened some opera scenes for fear that they would be lost on Western audiences.  Having no prior experience with any Peking Opera, I found the scenes fascinating and integral to appreciating the entire story.  Spend the extra time if you can. mind, Dieyi seemed to be infatuated with Shitzou as soon as he got there. However you look at it, this is a film that has great performances all around. I especially loved Leslie Cheung as the adult Cheng Dieyi (requiem eternem Leslie, 1956-2003), not to mention Gong Li. An excellent film, but be forewarned: it's almost three hours long. 10/10 His real, enduring love is performing. It is the one constant that has seen him through.

However, it was reality. reputation as one of the most brilliant narrative and artistic directors of our time, along with other such contemporary auteurs as Kieslowski, Bertolucci and Kurosawa.You can not call yourself a film-buff if you haven't seen this movie.

Fearless (1993)	the Oscars.Director Peter Weir himself considers this his greatest work and was greatly stung by what he considered the slight it was given by Hollywood and the public.

It's a tear-jerker, and it's certainly haunted by the ghosts of the dead, but it's well-worth watching if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the best actors in the business at his best. and after that scene, we realize how amazing it is that he and the rest of them could have survived, and how fragile their life was in the face of overwhelming force.This story imagines a disaster and how useless it is to be afraid of a force more powerful than any individual (and that is the main character's profound insight). as Carla, a fellow crash survivor with whom Max forms an especially strong and significant bond. Written for the screen by Rafael Yglesias (adapted from his own novel), beautifully filmed by Allen Davian, and with a haunting score by Maurice Jarre that so sensitively enhances the drama in an understated way, `Fearless' is an example of filmmaking at it's best. viewed alone, with no distractions whatsoever. One of the more powerful sublime moments in the film for me is when Max is merely sitting next to his rental car in the desert, making mud from his own spit.  He sees it in a new way.

Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless, as he folds, spindles, and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. Does ""FoaBH"" resemble Spinal Tap? Yes, a bit. Is it derivative of Spinal Tap? No, not really. The aim is more focused, the satire is better focused, and to be honest, it's funnier. rap group N.W.H(N****z with hats).They are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene.Its a shame this film is not in the Top 250.Runtime:88min 10/10 of the most consistently funny movies I've ever seen. Cundieff, who did some hysterically funny segments for Michael Moore's TV Nation program, proves himself to be a solid director with an eye for biting satire. Unfortunately, some of the jokes are a little weak. That said, there are moments when this movie nails some of the hypocrisies of pop music (not just hip-hop). Pretty good performances all around, too. "	7.2	0
With Honors (1994)	"uptight pre-med student.The four Harvard kids learn a whole lot about life and what's really important in it. And I think they all will graduate life with honors.This review is respectfully dedicated to David T. Frank who checked out of life way too soon. Brendan, Joe, and the rest of the cast, this film deeply moved him, good job folks. Brendan Fraser, Josh Hamilton, and the spectacular Moira Kelly.  With a great performance by the priceless Gore Vidal - who's also in another of my favorite films, ""Bob Roberts.""There are also some nice shots of the Harvard University campus, and the film accurately re-creates the turmoil, joy, and passion and the hundred other emotions that come with college life. Fraser could kick ass and look hot but I was pleased to see him act. The guy´s good and his character was really captivating, which gets the movie going.There is a lesson coming from the movie, but it´s not one that will make you want roll your eyes (although it´s perfectly acceptable).I watched it twice, and I´d watch it again. you've got to choose how to live your life rather than just let it happen. It's a very ""carpe diem"" experience ;) It's also a perfect mix of comedy and drama, Patrick Dempsey and Joe Pesci kept the laughs coming. Not for the cynical or the bitter, enter it with an open heart and you can't help but be affected. caught this movie in the store and thought I'd give it a go because of Joe Pesci and Brendan Frasier. It's a very rewarding movie about life, and how sometimes we need to step back and see that we're all human. I'll definatly have to commend Brendan on his acting, a great job, and he's won new respect. Heartwarming film. "	6.7	0
Flesh and Bone (1993)	"is negligent, as a viewer, not to acknowledge it's quality. It is an excellent piece of film making and Dennis Quaid shows just what a brilliant and understated actor he is. James Caan, Meg Ryan, and Gwyneth Paltrow are also up to Quaids level here. I highly recommend this movie. It's different. It's interesting. It's engrossing. And it's brilliantly done. yet after this film ended, I knew I could not put it into words. The purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. Most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. This film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when I checked. the TV series Boston Public just to hear its opening theme music, which he composed) and a closing scene as mythic as that of any cowboy classic. The film's conclusion flirts a bit with improbability but still works because, dear friends, karma does exist. It's not just a hippie word. Leave the Anti-Megs to their own gravitational plunge and enjoy. that the viewer stays mesmerized as the story unfolds.  Caan, too, is a wonder as the bad-to-the-bone father.  As for the sweeping and lovely cinematography, it perfectly realizes the beauty and desolation that is west Texas. The final scenes are guaranteed to put a lump in anyone's throat, tears included.  Recommended highly for discriminating movie fans everywhere. the sugary sweetness that plagued the majority of her roles that followed. Scott Wilson also shines in a small but memorable role. ""Flesh and Bone"" may never receive the attention it deserves, which is a shame because it is unquestionably a lyrical masterpiece, beautifully shot and acted, recalling those low-key gems of the seventies like ""The Rain People"". Highly recommended. "	6.3	0
Widows' Peak (1994)	"they say, with a marvelous twist that caught me totally off guard. Wonderful performances by all especially Joan Plowright who kept me laughing whenever she was on screen. It was nice to see Mia Farrow successfully widening her range, and Natasha Richardson wafted through the film with an aire of mystery about her -as did Farrow- commanding out attention throughout. not since ""Hannah and Her Sisters""(not much then either). Natasha is a newcomer to Widow's Peak and not all are glad to see her. She seems to change the quiet little village into a media circus. I won't spoil it by telling you any more. You will have to watch and enjoy it for yourself. This is a must see! Plowright, who gives her usual impeccable and entertaining performance. The pace, the humour, and the plot are all perfectly executed, culminating in a climax that your best guess would not anticipate. Probably more a woman's movie, but then most of the best ones are. I have watched it numerous times and my enjoyment has not abated. Definitely worth the time. specifically from Natasha Richardson and Mia Farrow.  Others have described this as a ""more a woman's movie"" but I beg to differ.  This is a great movie for anyone and as a man I must say that Ms Richardson looked absolutely ravishing in the beautiful vintage costumes and makeup.  A must see for any man or woman. great chemistry between them. You care about the characters; even the annoying ones. One can tell that the actors enjoyed making this movie. I would recommend this film to just about anyone. If you are of the persuasion that normally avoids chick flicks or period pieces, give this one a try. You might be surprised at what you've been missing. "	6.8	0
For Love or Money (1993)	American sitcom stars to make a prolonged impact in the movies in roles unlike his character from Family Ties. Anwar also gives another performance which leaves me increasingly baffled as to why she has not been used more in Hollywood.See this movie, it may not have been a hit but it will surprise you with its quality just the same. the money. Hell, i'd wear a skirt and put out for that kind of scratch.The director Barry Sonnenfeld has an interesting resume of hits (Men in Black) and misses (Wild Wild West) and just entertaining films (Get Shorty). This one is entertaining fluff. It's an hour and a half of your time that you won't regret spending. 7/10 stars. G'night! character, Andy, his dreams ... literally. Everything seemed to come in together ... you really understood then how much it meant to him, and his sharing it with Andy was a wonderful gesture of his love for her. The moment was magical, the best in the whole movie for me. Watch this if you like a conventionally exceptional love story. who is keen to help but things get complicated when Doug discovers that his new found friend and financial helper is going out with the girl who he has been after for months (Anwar).The outcome of this movie is no surprise and the love/hate relationship and chemistry between Fox and Anwar is very entertaining.Overall an enjoyable film for all ages. Or Money.  The music, written by Bruce Broughton is just awesome, and it completely sets the perfect tone for the many different scenes.  I especially love the music when Fox's character is walking down the subway steps after leaving work.  This is a great movie to watch with someone you love.  I would definitely recommend it. 	6.1	0
Firm, The (1993)	"Some things may have gone a little too far, like the conveniently placed pillow truck, but as a whole, The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations, The Rainmaker, in particular, but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot, as well as good direction and acting, makes it way above average. supercharged climax. Not having read the book, I see where others are disappointed with the ending. Having no comparison to make, I can only say that it kept me absorbed until the final scene. Definitely a must-see if you enjoy action thrillers with a climactic punch. One of the best films of the '90s, full of suspenseful twists and turns. ""Basic Instinct"" as Abby McDeere, the ""cheated wife"", not only by her husband, but also by the firm he works for. Sydney Pollack showcases some of his best work as director, especially by the opening segment that describes Mitch McDeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes. Such a GREAT adaptation, and a even better film to watch! well done, but a thriller needs to hide some things, show some things, create ambiance and mystery, and so on, visually. It doesn't really happen.So, for a kind of technical high-stakes, rich person's good-guy bad-guy suspense film, it will get you through, but barely. By the last five minutes, if you aren't sucked in, you'll want to scream ""hurry up!"" way it's all brought off. Small wonder that Tom Cruise was chosen to star in the big screen adaptations of that television classic.When I watch The Firm, I'm reminded of that line from another television classic that one Hannibal Smith used to say about he loved it when a plan comes together. That's what you will like about The Firm. "	6.8	0
Free Willy (1993)	"to Simon Wincer for this great masterpiece. We need more movies like this, not a laughable rubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment. I rated Free Willy 10 out of 10 as an excellent and beautiful family friendly movie. Check out also its two sequels. They are also pretty good.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English. if it wasn't just natural in the specific sequences. His facial expressions and body language fit into the total frame as well. The story has some profoundly human themes to it. I can't help it, I think this one is both entertaining and deep, dealing with emotions and prospects of life, with integrity and courage in the face of danger. this out today and watched it again and it was still pretty magical to me, although I'm much older now. I don't see why this is rated a 5.2. I guess I wouldn't tell every adult to go out and watch it, but if you have kids, or just love animals, then give this a shot. It's a good film. will, for our entertainment.Now picture what I am describing to you isn't a whale.  Picture ""it"" as being human.I applaud Richard and Laura Donner for making this film and I certainly hope people can see this and change their thinking about things.  It is a powerful film.  And it is one that should be taken more seriously. have done. This film has taught us a lot about captivity and the need of freedom. There should be more films like this. If you are in need of a friend there will always be on in animals and this film has shown us so with Jesse and Willy. This film will continue to touch many hearts of the world. "	5.9	0
Fresh (1994)	look. The dreamy scenes where Fresh is seen looking toward Manhattan at different times of the day, is pure poetry. This is an important movie dealing with an important subject. Thanks to Mr. Yakin, we go into that world that, for some of us, might as well be in another continent, but never right here in another part of town! that kills off others. It moves at a healthy, but not crazy pace, and there are some truly chilling moments, which really make you ponder over humanity's capacity for mindless violence.This is certainly the best film I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, and I advise anyone who craves intelligent, thoughtful films to go out and buy this one. by Yakin (though the final scene is devastating):  we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist, we don't need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room.  That's a small quibble, though, because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate, and Jackson's early speech about the game is an ingenious device. impressed me so much.Overall, this film is great. It is boldly honest and originally beautiful (in repetition of myself) that needs to be re-released or remembered time after time. I am so glad that I discovered it and cannot wait to show it to friends and family. It is nothing short of the perfect film! Grade: ***** out of ***** which was playing everyone like they were live chess pieces. He got what he wanted all by playing one against the other. This movie proved that a film does not have to be high budget or big names to be great. If that were the case, The Last Action Hero or Reindeer Games should win an OSCARS for Best Movie. 	7.6	1
Fugitive, The (1993)	"and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, ""The Fugitive"" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993. Rating: Four stars. of the police. The result is an interesting cat-and-mouse game between him and the police that never allows your attention to fade away.The story is perhaps not exceptional, but thanks to the good directing and acting and the constant action and tension, this movie really delivers everything that you can expect from it. I give it an 8.5 - 9/10. back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate EVERYONE'S acting in this movie.And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an ""edgy"" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words. Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.There is magic, here! supporting actor in '93 than Kilmer in Tombstone, but Jones' work here was well deserving of his Oscar.The Fugitive belongs on every top 100 list and if the AFI wasn't so enthralled with older movies, they would see that films like this are more worthy than some of the mediocrity that graces their findings.  This is an incredible film. "	7.8	1
Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)	"deep eyes and charismatic presence or that of a soldier with his masterful horsemanship (performed by the actor himself), Jason Patric brings a special depth and beauty to Gatewood, making him one of the most impressive and under rated heroes ever captured on film. His presence alone makes this film a great classic, as well as a thought provoking treasure! of the ""Geronimo Campaign"" out there. Head and shoulders above much of the other junk out there about this important American figure. It is, to boot, beautifully filmed and deftly directed. And the narrative approach worked perfectly with this subject. Well worth a couple of viewing hours by anyone who sincerely wants to know what was up with all that.' plot faithfully depicts the historical progress of events and refuses to completely demonize the Whites (although they clearly are being portrayed as the expansionist aggressors)in order to build a protagonist-antagonist plot-structure. This makes the movie slow, and for non-buffs a tedious experience.Finally, the film has a terrific soundtrack by Ry Cooder and a knock-out performance by Wes Studi as Geronimo! never can win his war against white men. Especially this poetic and realistic movie is by comparison with other Indian sagas not a fairy tale from far west. Hill tells the truth and so we see only desperate people and no heroes - on both sides. Great - a must see for fans. I give 8 out of 10 stars. Good sound if you have the DVD and a surround sound system.Yes, this leans in the PC class with big-time leanings toward the Indian cause, but the Apache people apparently had a good case for their cause, at least with Geronimo's convincing question near the end of the movie: ""There is plenty of land. Why do you want it all?"" "	6.5	0
Getaway, The (1994)	Bassinger look like monks. This movie is not exactly Mary Poppins. There's almost too much of a mean edge to it....almost. Perhaps I enjoy ogling Bassinger too much to can this movie for its baseness.Whatever, this entertains to the degree that it makes it a very quick two hours. There is no way you could get bored watching this film. action scenes are top notch. Maybe I'm just a sucker for colorful characters and the bank heist angle is well done. Best of all is Alec Baldwin's character, Doc. Baldwin and the rest of the cast really deliver their lines with panache.Bank jobs, car chase, cat-and-mouse in a four story hotel, steamy sex, crazy characters.... what else do you want? that tops the original in several aspects. The acting is top notch by almost all the major characters. The action is fast paced and very violent. (I base this on the unrated HD-DVD).So if you have a few bucks lying around. Get this movie, I am pretty sure you can get it for under $10 in about every big store.. form here and very compelling to watch together. Besides the McCoys (and Richard Farnsworth), it is a B film. Michael Madson's hair is a real challenge to deal with. At least you can cut out of the Richard Marx end credit song. You have to live with Michael Madson's hair for the whole ride. IMDb rating should be around 7. even the supporting actors are very good: James Woods, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly and Richard Farnsworth. Alec and Kim are the Bonnie & Clyde of the nineties portraying very human criminals, their conflicts are so real in the story... after all it's one of the best films in the genre of the 90s! A must see for every action-thriller fan! 	5.7	0
Getting Even with Dad (1994)	"at places such as embarcadero bart station,chinatown,the aquarium,and golden gate park. with an unexpected problem: his ex-wife leaves their son (Culkin) with him once he hasn't looked after him for years. The boy wants some attention from his dad, so he hides the coins his father has stolen before he could use it. If the thief wants his coins back, he must give the boy some good time. My Rate 7/10 into ""Home Alone"" style antics as the young son brilliantly outsmarts his father time and time again. This all seems very familiar. Eventually the movie ends after nearly 2 1/2 hours of capers and disbelief. I wish they had of keeped the son out of it- police trying to 'get even' with the crooks sounds like a much better movie. to have been born without a personality. Yes, Danson is very watered down in this movie. To be honest, I don't blame him--this is the type of stuff that belongs on made-for-TV movies. You know your career has hit rock-bottom when you're in something like this.And just think, this was made somewhere around ten years ago.What a disaster.* / ***** used to blackmail the ponytailed Danson into pleasing the obnoxious Culkin. HOME ALONE(1990) and MY GIRL(1991)were at least worth watching. This is neither funny or interesting.  Danson fares well in his arrogant way. Gleene Headly is not believable  as a detective. Also in the cast are:Gailard Sartain, Saul Rubinek and Hector Elizondo. Geared for the grammar school set. "	4.7	0
Go Fish (1994)	"ad-libbed. I watched this movie (again and again) and thought THESE ARE DYKES!  This is NOT a Hollywood flick with shiny Hollywood glitz gals and high budget special effects. This film is RAW, and will appeal to lesbians and independent film lovers.  Warning: if you thought ""Bound"" was the quintessential lesbian flick, you will NOT like ""Go Fish"". movie in the summer of 1994, as a young lesbian who was just comming out of the closet who had never had a girlfriend.  I found the chemistry between Max and Ely so real, that I found myself yearning for that kind of relationship.  Daria's trail was also very well done, as many lesbians do share that attitude. (i.e. basic instinct and heavenly creatures) and that's what i like most about go fish because it's witty, romantic, and very close to the heart and although it's not the best film ever made, but who knows, a person who is a student in high school or in college might watch the movie during history/social studies class on lesbian history. the lead character, Max, actually is very good.  But the movie is so poorly constructed, and most of her friends are so one-note, that the novelty gets old pretty soon.  I was bored halfway through it; there is a clever twist near the end which raised it to a 5 for me, but don't expect much in between. just watched Preaching to the Perverted with her in the lead role last night which I also enjoyed immensley...she has a lot of talent and obviously chooses her roles selectively.It is an arty film which I think some people may watch with the wrong intentions...they will be disappointed but so what...they're not the people the writers intended the movie for.

Good Man in Africa, A (1994)	does in his role and this is not just because Friels is hard done by as the 'put-upon' embassy attache. The belly laughs expected of a good farce do not materialise although there is plenty to chuckle about and think on. However, for the chuckles alone the film is well worth seeing, now let us see how the book compares. to them for giving us Chaplin, Bob Hope, and so many others. But I digress. And this film is not on the level of Chaplin or Hope. I was disappointed. The biggest disappointment was watching great talents like Sean Connery, Diana Rigg and Lou Gossett sleepwalking through their roles on their way to a paycheck. They could have done better. looking female actors also help the film along although the  likes of Diana Rigg are under-used. Connery puts in a forgetful performance but both Friels and Lithgow are entertaining. The sticky atmosphere also comes through as does the general hurly burly life of a foreign diplomat in Africa..........I'll give it 6.5/10, easy going and good for a few laughs. much original humour and more than a few tributes to revered filmography - enough to keep me laughing, smiling and/or trying to remember what movie was being referred to, for most of the movie.  Comedy/satire may not be Beresford's best long suit, but I'll take this over just about any Hollywood comedy movie I've seen in quite some time. of humor regarding royal formalities, sexual clichés and even venereal diseases.But the main problem of the movie is perhaps its ending. The ending is quite abrupt and the scene thereafter is surprisingly mundane. In fact, I don't get the idea behind all that stuff. I haven't read the original novel but seems like now I want to check it out. 	5.0	0
Guilty as Sin (1993)	"Jenny does not find a way out afraid of losing her bar. Hard to believe that the justice system and her law firm could not find a way out of the situations created by her client. Don Johnson has great performance and the music score is also good. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Culpado Como o Pecado"" (""Guilty as Sin"") last-minute witness for the defense. I won't give away too much, but her motivation for doing what she does is totally inscrutable.Lastly, there's the gruesome climax. It plays ludicrously, though De Mornay is allowed one last, good moment. Her hysteria at the peak of her ordeal is touchingly real. Otherwise, the whole thing feels forced and phony.So does the movie. murder borders on ridiculous. The only redeeming factor about Don Johnson is that his character is so despicable, you have to hang around for the ending, simply to see him get what's due. Don't blink however because the end when it finally does come is both swift and a real stretch of reality. Watchable, but not much more. - MERK seemed that character - Don Johnson seems this character and it's a great and effortless performance and you should see it. (And if you weren't a fan of his television series, don't worry - neither was I - I never really paid attention to him - and wham, I'm now a fan!).This guy has gotten to be a superb actor. Johnson more, than in this, it's cool finale making you wanna jump up and clap. Despite the movie being a tad dry, with a kind of slow moving story, the latter really doesn't affect the film, thanks to bad guy Johnson and all the effectively tense and truly scary moments he delivers, in his performance, where sinning never looked better.

Hard Target (1993)	John Wick 1 and 2 my films, this is my film from the 90's and I love it so so so much. I love this film to death, I amazingly love it. Also Hard Target 2 doesn't exist for me. I never liked the sequel to the film skip the sequel and watch this one. Highly recommend to the fans. VHS cover in a video store. I didn't even know that movie exists. Hard Target is a 1993 action film that marked the US directorial debut of acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo, who brought out his Asian style of action to Western cinema.10/10 for me I love this movie to death, It is my number 1 favorite action film. what he does best: be an incredibly-nasty and brutal villain. An added bonus in here - a real hoot - is old man Wilfred Brimley as Van Damme's French uncle who comes to his nephew's aid.Add a great blues soundtrack and you have a great film to feed your male hormones with when needing to be fed some gratuitous violence. is like a preview of things to come...meaning Broken Arrow, Face/Off and the ongoing blockbuster Mission Impossible II! You'll really see how far Woo went from this debut.Definitely worth watching! Hard Target is not John Woo's best, but it's Van Damme's best film ever! This is where you see Van Damme in his greatest action, and thank Woo for that! in which he finally struck gold with Face/Off. Hard Target comes out a dark action thriller packed with a superb blend of martial arts shootouts and explosions. I recommend this to any 1 weather your an action junkie, die hard van damme fan or just a general film buff. Up there with Die Hard this is a true action classic 	6.1	0
Heaven & Earth (1993)	"for her actions, and her lack of relief from her revenge.  Ribisi is stunning as the outwardly simple, infatuated boy-like man with subtly revealed inner strength and cunning. Sometimes it is nice to take a break from the usual fare and take a ride on a work of art.  I loved this film and will watch it again. just magnificent to view. I also appreciated the director's ""sky cam"" with some wonderful aerial shots.The ""R"" rating comes from a very, very brief sex scene, which doesn't involve the major characters. There is almost no profanity in here. A strange film to label but it sure is a visual treat. I liked it even more on the second viewing are what this film revolves around: it is not a film for tourists or spectators. The excellent performances of Giovanni Ribisi and Cate Blanchett (apart and together) should only be missed if you are mainly looking for external adventure and action. Though it shares its part in weapons, scheme and drama, 'Heaven' is not blockbuster material: it is art material. of Krzysztof Kieslowski's work; as if, because the story is based on one of his ideas, the follow-through had to be some sort of homage. That strikes me as totally irrelevant. The idea came to other hands, who made a film according to their own lights. There's no need to compare what-might-have-beens. This is a beautiful, transcendent film. See it. of unearthly beauty, top-tier cinematography, *and* her talent that makes this a level above Streep, Dench, Bergman, Hepburn, and any other great at their absolute best.I suppose it's hard to imagine the existence of a full level beyond what we consider--previously--to have been the most beautiful and artful female performance on screen. But that level is here, and it's clear. "	7.1	0
Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993)	"necessary for the movie and that's why I still appreciate it.In the end this is an absurd comedy and parody on many kinds of movies. If you like this kind of humor and know most of the other movies, then you'll probably have a great time with it. I sure liked it and that's why I give it a 7/10. the same character as in Rambo 3, with many of his lines unchanged. If you've watched the Rambo-movies, (most important the third one), you'll get more of the gags and the dialogs, especially in the scenes from the Buddhist temple. Saddam Hussein is also excellent, he looks really like the real one! If you like stupid and crazy movies...WATCH THIS! and when the army wrote the sounds of the morse code (Dah di di dah dah di dah)! Couldn't stop laughing!!! The casting is great, with Lloyd Bridges as the President and Ryan Stiles as Rainbowitz, this is a great movie spoof! I recommend this movie for slapstick fans and people who just want a laugh, a lot of laughs!! like me, who enjoy these zany goof ball comedies. I really do prefer this kind of comedy to many I've seen today where it's more shock than originality. The Hot Shot movies are so much fun and I would recommend these movies for anyone. Just sit back and have fun with these comedies, I think you'll have a good time.7/10 ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie. "	6.6	0
Live Nude Girls (1995)	subsiquent succses of the above mentioned show its high time this brillantly acted,written and directed film got the attention it deserves.Career best performences are put in by most every actress in the film.Discussing the film in detail would rob the viewer of the suprises that help make the film such a treat.I strongly recommend the film to any and all. the viewer is an eavesdropper). Having just seen the newly released DVD version, it occurred to me how reminiscent the dialogue and style is to Sex in the City, which started its run several years after this movie. It is not a great and serious film work, but it is good, interesting, well-made, and may be a good conversation starter. relationships. (the pains! hahaha!) Basically leading the woman to herself and the fact that women always have one thing in common together which always brings them back together.A great female bonding movie, a great movie about diversity and also quite amusing as well!Highly recommended for women with a sense of humour who like to shmooze and bond with other women;P their suppressed unconventional longings. Gradual mutual acceptance and support leads to a sense of empowerment to experiment and take a chance of being themselves, insulated from traditional female fear of losing their reputation and becoming stigmatized. A new strength comes from their new bond in womanhood that gives them a new found freedom and courage to own their authentic sexuality. with a close-knit friendship which binds them together. The title can be somewhat misleading, although there is plenty of nudity involved, as this movie is more about women empowering women than about male exploitation/domination of women. A different slant in the old 'friends get back together for a reunion/wedding/death/whatever and talk/explore their past/renew bonds/whatever' genre. Worth a watch - 7/10. 	5.4	0
Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, The (1995)	"buds between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald. There also is some nice cinematography in here.Some might find it boring but I didn't. There was just something about this, a charm that made me feel good as I watched it and had me smiling even more by the end. This is a ""sleeper,"" a movie you might pass up..... but don't. about him as an actor but he is simply hilarious as Morgan.So what is this movie about? There isn't much of a plot so without giving anything away I'll just say that it's about a  sleepy Welsh village coming together for a noble cause. What's the cause and would you find it noble?Watch the movie and judge for yourself. underdone, the writing so sparkling, the plot so effervescently predictable in macro, but not in micro.  The film score is wonderful, too, using as it does actual Welsh melodies rearranged into big 'movie soundtrack' full orchestration.  And has there ever been a more beautiful cinematographic masterstroke than the torches on the mountain at sunset?  I think not! their names back then- very quaint yet logical to attach an occupation to their names! The photography was wonderful at showing off the unspoiled landscape- I really felt like I was a part of the events. This movie inspires me to want to visit the final resting place of Reverend Jones with a handful of earth from my own garden!  It adds to the mystery and beauty of the region and adds a unique feel to the film.Children may find it too slow and dull, but anyone with an appreciation for a good, heartwarming story will enjoy it.  I recommend it in particular to those with a love for the British Isles in general, or Wales in particular. "	6.6	0
House of the Spirits, The (1993)	"Chile and Argentina are not white. The whole cast represents EXACTLY what chileans look like and the difference between the higher and lower class. You can learn a lot from this film. This movie is 110% recommended. It may have some differences with the book but it is respectful to it. Excellent camera and direction work at a spectacular location. spreads are just incredible, I can't see anyone else in this character. However, I believe Wynona Rider and Antonio Banderas' love could be more developed, both are terrific actors and deserved to have more chances to show it so, but they surely didn't disappoint us when they are on screen. A very beautiful, melancholic movie, with performances you'll never forget. loved the people with the notable and chilly brilliant exception from Jeremy Irons (Can we ever really love his incredible characters?)Another underrated movie that seeks much and delivers well although at times with a bit too much telegraphing (the bathing scene with the young Blanca for example.)It was a three hankie movie in the end, A great three hankie movie.metro_alma@earthlink.net psychically touched wife like an angel-she is so  ethereal she seems of the spirit world. Glenn Close plays her  love-starved sister-in-law;she conveys her desperation so adeptly.  Meryl Streep treats her as a real sister and showers sisterly affection  on this poor creature.  It is a spellbinding tale and one that has relevance to all families. book evokes a much more magical, mythical, and ""Spirit""-ual feeling that reflects the special flavor of life in South America, especially with Clara having green hair, and more powers in the book. A lot of that feeling is left out of the movie.However, the movie mostly makes up for this lack in the extremely vivid presentation of the characters' emotions. "	6.9	0
House Party 3 (1994)	funny moments compared to the previous films and Immature, as well as Uncle Vester and the aunt, destroyed the whole film. There are a whole load of other issues I have with the film, but I don't want to give anything away.Do yourself a favour; don't watch it! And knowing this film is tripe, don't watch House Party 4 either! psychopathic side. This alone brings me and a fair few others close to tears.Add to this Showboat and the cast of ex-con catering and defy virtually anyone not to need picking up from the floor. Hysterics are guaranteed.Not big, not clever and certainly not in any top 100 lists, but a film that gets better each time I see it. as younger performers. They don't have that anymore. This would be more interesting historically if TLC are main characters. The story meanders. The comedy isn't funny. Tisha Campbell has only a few lines. The other actors are nothing interesting. The three kids are more annoying than fun. There's a party at the end but I don't care by that point. small budget films can continue to make money even after they loose their appeal. Take a look at Scary Movie 4 being released soon. Honestly, is it necessary? I do not suggest this film or this entire series. The first one, if you are forced to watch, than watch. Otherwise, don't waste your brain space! Grade: * out of ***** the first two films were great.  My advice is just stay with the first film. 	4.4	0

I'll Do Anything (1994)	"aforementioned movies, but they did a very good job. Also look out for the character played by Albert Brooks, which is very familiar with Jack Nicholson's character in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. It almost seems a trademark of James L. Brooks, who keeps delivering the goods with his original and always fresh romantic comedies. Don't miss this one! 8/10 depressed that I hope he doesn't kill himself cause I really like everything he's done, even The Hulk, and especially Affliction and that Martin Short with a kid movie. Joely Richardson is gorgeous! Julie Kavner and James Brooks are great. I highly recommend this film, and hope to see it again soon on DVD with all of the deleted scenes. as a down on his luck actor with a brat of daughter and trying to bond with her whilst dealing with machinations of the film industry.Where Brooks succeeded so well when he turned his eye on TV news with Broadcast News, the story here is not strong enough and although the actors try hard the film comes off as hollow. there, a group of ladies who work in casting  are asked, when deciding yay-or nay on this actor, if they would sleep with him.     But in the end, it stays true to its source, meaning it doesn't look completely down at Hollywood or anything else. It's just a really adorable feel-good movie.Did I mention adorable?-Sep it really was an ""in-house"" film, one that anyone who has been through what the various characters have could identify with, but perhaps not us out in the hinterlands (coming from Wyoming to Australia, I'm definitely hinterland!).  Kudos to actors and director for keeping this film together.  With lesser talent, it could have fallen flat on its face. "	5.6	0
In the Army Now (1994)	there were a lot of sexual innuendos, too many for a PG rating but not surprising in a modern-day comedy. That comedy overall is good with some laugh-out-loud scenes.Also, as with many films, the ending gets carried away. It was really dumb, but for most of this movie it was entertaining enough to certainly recommend if you need a laugh. I was watching them in the desert. I remember when our plane landed I just looked around and there was nothing only sand and thats what they see. This film understandebly never won any Oscars and I doubt if the American Film Institute will ever fight to preserve it, but it is still a nice way to waste two hours. all the basic service comedy situations going all the way back to Abbott&Costello in Buck Privates. Especially in the training sequences. Pauly Shore and Andy Dick probably grew up on Bud&Lou, but they do the routines with a Generation X twist.I liked the film and thanked God I was not in the situations that Pauly and the rest were in. troops by purifying water if needed.  The film is actually very funny and had me laughing consistently, Shore stays away from being too annoying.  Andy Dick is just as funny as he is on NewsRadio.  Petty and Grier are also funny.  I recommend this for Shore fans and those who want a good impression of him. funny guy and a great screen presence.In the Army Now is a super funny movie, mostly due to Pauly, but Andy Dick, Lori Petty and David Allen Grier are great also. It's difficult for me to put my finger on why I like this movie so much, but watching it makes me feel good, and that's all I care about. 	4.8	0
In the Line of Fire (1993)	"and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.  The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it! cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,""I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger"".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie. well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received anOscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and beon the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!! about killing.  Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him.  The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel.  Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn. heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, ""Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.""Well written and worth watching. "	7.2	0

The film as a film is very good  well acted, well paced, well directed and engaging from the early realistic shots of Belfast in the 1970's through to the 'I'm going out the front door' finale that is no less impacting for us knowing it is coming. someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.   I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.   The soundtrack is great without exception too!   A total and utter classic. powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes. have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound. "	8.1	1
Inkwell, The (1994)	several adults throughout the movie. What I liked most about this movie was the beautiful portrayal of blacks in love. The kids, and the parents. It was like watching an old home movie of my own family.Too bad Matty Rich disappeared after this film. I was kinda hoping it would turn into a trend. Blacks in positive roles in films. that the black audience didn't support the film. We keep crying for better images on film but when they come we don't support it. If you are an African-American you owe it to yourself and Matty Rich to see this film and hopefully some other ethnic groups will see it and understand that we're not all drug dealers and pimps. a teenager.  You also view the complex relationship between not only cultures but within the family as well.  You are pretty much leaving this film wanting more.  If one film really cries out for a sequel it's this one. MATTY, I'M BEGGING YOU, MAKE INKWELL 2 AND SHOW US WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE CHARACTERS YEARS LATER!!! talent with this heartfelt film. draw him out of his shell. The title refers to the part of the beach that is occupied by blacks, and it is a revelation to the shy kid who has never seen anything like it. Turman as the pompous, upwardly mobile brother-in-law steals the show, which constantly veers from drama to comedy. Worth a watch, although it is uneven. 	6.5	0
Jimmy Hollywood (1994)	"few people have seen it. It is brilliant, funny, sometimes sad and deep, but overall a story full of quotations. Joe Pesci is even greater than the usual, never mind the long blond hair. There is an astonishingly funny performance given by Christian Slater, to me his most impressive ever. Search for it everywhere you can and see for yourself. to identify with the likable Jimmy and his associates on the mean streets of the film capital.  The supporting cast is well-chosen, and the plotline progresses evenly to its satisfying final wrap.  If you liked ""Ed Wood"", ""Jimmy Hollywood"" could also be your ticket back to the movies as they were seldom seen by the rest of us. poster to this movie, I can only tell that the movie is as COOL as Pesci and Slater cool-looking while sunbathing at the pool. I just can't imagine, how such great movie could earn only $3,6 mlns!!! That's a shame for american audience. I recommend it for everyone who searches for some intelligent entertainment and for all Joe Pesci fans. with a good point (crime is bad and hope is good) and good acting should have made more money than any of the current Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar movies, but the movie world is not ruled by values and quality.  I give this movie a 9.5/10 I'd even think about making this movie a perfect ten. are not patient. They want everything in one big dose.  Jimmy is slow to deliver in that sense, the movie takes its time.  Those willing to wait, are very lucky. And those who are unwilling, miss a truly enjoyable experience.See it.  If you are perceptive and patient when it comes to movies. Otherwise, go see Titanic again. "	5.3	0
Judgment Night (1993)	for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end. of ***** very good scenes, one which involves them hiding in a train, having to bribe the hobos to keep quiet. A lot of action, some good acting, and constantly keeps moving. I give this movie a solid 6/10, because there were a few things that bothered me, but I won't go into this for the sake of not ruining the film. name Everlast,called Whitey Ford Sings the blues.anyway...everyone one i just mentioned did excellent work in this film.but for me,Emile Estevez and Peter Greene(Under Siege 2,The Usual Suspects,Permanent Midnight)were standouts.the movie itself is high octane excitement that doesn't let up until the end.it's a movie better watched late at night,with the lights off.for me,the verdict on Judgment Night is a 9/10 alternating between several different moods. His first score (electronic based) was rejected by Hopkins but that difficult decision proved be a good judgment (ha!) as the end result is one of the film's best features.Judgment Night is certainly an overlooked tour-de-force and is a brilliant action film with fine performances all round, but Leary completely and utterly steals the show. 	6.6	0
Jurassic Park (1993)	"the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film. lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made) fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film. "	8.1	1
Kalifornia (1993)	"Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real. enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence, an ending that was somewhat disappointing.Overall, however, ""Kalifornia"" is an entertaining film, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis. imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste (although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way). Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me (it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out). I reward this movie with an 8/10. a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. ""Kalifonia"" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore. be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This film is disturbing on more than one level. But then, it's meant to be. "	6.7	0
King of the Hill (1993)	"of some of my closest relatives. Spalding Gray and Elizabeth McGovern's characters deserve a full movie of their own. Lisa Eichhorn's tender fear of having to leave her children behind is just another of the ravishing notes of this stunning film. If you haven't seen it. Give yourself the pleasure. You are going to love every little bit of it. film that, as I have already said, is (in my opinion) the greatest American film of the nineties and should be seen by everyone who is a fan of not just intelligent cinema, but film lover's in general.  And it's about time the film got some kind of proper video and/or DVD release, as it's unavailability is scandalous. 10/10 not a new theme, any more than that of the capable child flourishing in adversity, Soderberg brings a timeless quality and a steady, gentle mood to this piece, making it more about the hearts of the people than the tragic times which are displayed. Jesse Bradford, as the central child, and Adrien Brody as his older friend, really shine. Nice. Oscar winner Adrien Brody in his first major role as Aaron's ""big brother"" role model, and Grammy winner Lauryn Hill in a nice bit part as a sympathetic gum-chewing elevator operator.Although historically little seen, this film has been universally lauded, and as the early masterwork of an Oscar winning director, it's a crime that there has been no DVD release. it's not very likely that you'll be able to find it at your local video store. Especially if all you have is the local communist Blockbuster near you. Anyway, King of the Hill should be regarded and known far more highly than what it is. It's a sin for a movie this great to not get its due. Grade: A+ "	7.6	1
Lassie (1994)	"cooped up in the big city with nothing but rock, hard and soft, music and endless music videos to watch and waste his life, and hearing, away with. But most of all if he didn't move out to the country he never would have got to know and become a life-long friend, like everyone else in the movie, with Lassie. movie which focuses on some young kids and of course, Lassie, is good for a night at home in your jammies. My parents were very happy when we picked this off the shelf at the video store.  While my sister and I were very happy that Lassie was so beautiful, and that we had fun watching this movie together. was also quite fortunate to be surrounded by other great actors such as Michelle Williams and Charlie Hofheimer.I really loved this story because it expressed the true values of family and unconditional love. I recommend this film to families, children, and adults alike. I still love this movie and probably always will. I give it a 9 out of 10. for most of the USA. The music is good, photography is excellent and rich is color, story extremely possible, locations were outstanding. Production gave a feeling that you were right there is the location and experiencing everything as it happened. My four year-old loved along with the rest of the family. It kept everybody attention. Overall an excellent family movie. a Labrador retriever can herd, the canine star of this movie can give birth to puppies. I'm sure that the problem was that the writer didn't want to say ""border COLLIE or Bearded COLLIE or Australian SHEPHERD, but why not ""Corgi,"" or ""Sheltie,"" or ""Tervuren?""

Don't whine to me about artistic merit, character development, internal meditations on life and all that crap-I have those movies on my list too. It's an action movie, where the bad guys are supposed to die, cars are meant to explode when scratched, the good guy is untouchable, and it knows it. 8 out of 10 at comedy or even a family film. It was just meant to be fun to watch. And that's what matters most in any film. There are things about the film that don't work, but there are things about THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE that don't work, either. All that really matters is, Are we entertained? On that note, LAST ACTION HERO delivers. it for what it's intended.This movie is on my top five of my favorite Arnold films, because of it's boldness, and the fact that Arnold can be really funny when he wants to be. It's on my top twenty favorite comedy movies, and it's also in my DVD collection.  Don't worry Arnold.  Your true fans love this movie. film it's certainly a good one with a very good concept.  The intentional continuity errors are funny and clever, the movie cliche's are great.  So what if it's a little cheesy and Arnold is the only decent actor?  Enjoy the conflict of reality and fiction, and see this movie because it's a fun and somewhat thoughtful flick. "	6.3	0

Fox fans or anyone just looking for a good laugh! have the cute, talented Christina Vidal Who for some reason we don't see anymore. She is perfectly poised in her scenes with Fox.

This movie is great and everybody in the family will enjoy this. in the early 90's- smoking and trying to quit.

Lightning Jack (1994)	there when he wrote it.A series of wonderfully scenes in bars all over the West, culminate in a perfect last heist that nobody knows about, and robs Hogan of his wanted fame.Unfortunately, the box-office showed less confidence in the movie than it's investors on the Aussie stock-market did, but do not let that deter you from a very funny movie. Jim Carrey's and spontaneous enough to steal the show without any lines. Lighting Jack wasn't able to read without his glasses , but how he tried to hide it from everyone.

Paul Hogan's stiff acting is an asset here, Cuba Gooding Jr steals the show hilariously, without saying a single word.

M. Butterfly (1993)	"is exceptional as one who is just as driven and hooked psychologically in his own way as what it is in him that drives him to fulfill Jeremy's ecstasy and descent into irretrievable madness. Definitely one of the best movies ever! I hope this makes it to DVD sometime soon as it surely deserves to be seen again and again. because David Cronenberg is undoubtedly the finest director to deal with the most important topic in the story: gender bending. ""M. Butterfly"" is the Canadian Cronenberg's first Hollywood funded debut. The surprise plot of the sorted true love story is one of espionage. An adults only film, it is one of intrigue, sizzling romance, twists & turns, deception & betrayal. as good, but still fine, and the supporting cast includes a nice turn from Brit veteran Ian Richardson ('Dark City'). Most Cronenberg fans will probably find this a bit difficult to get into, as the material isn't exactly typical of the director, but it's much better than its bad press makes out. I expected to hate it, and I didn't. believable. Directed by David Cronemberg, ""M Butterfly"" is probably one of his best films with an intriguing love story about clash of cultures, having China as background in a troubled revolutionary moment great acting and magnificent cinematography and set decoration. Even when watched more than once, ""M Butterfly"" is still an attractive gem. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""M Butterfly"" been searching for a copy of Damage also starring Jeremy Irons...haven't found that one either. Why are the most artistic films, the ones that really have something to say, the last to make it to the after-market release of the film?? I have noticed that Jeremy Irons tends to portray emotionally crippled characters...it certainly works for him in this film! "	6.8	0
Made in America (1993)	"on screen he is a joy, still in his ""Fresh Prince"" mode here he certainly doesn't disappoint. Nia Long is the real find here. If one person from this film should have been given a better shake than anyone it is her. She is vibrant, funny and worthy of the people she shares the screen with. That says a lot. it manages to more or less avoid cringes and concentrates on the laughs, only giving as much time to story as is necessary to keep everything moving on. Against the odds and thanks to the superb cast this is a good natured film. It harks back to the optimism of the early nineties, and seems strangely innocent, eleven years on. good gags in it, although the movie is not overstuffed with them. The decent, heartwarming plot (just the right amount of twists) handles the race aspects with an exemplary ease.Jennifer Tilly's bit-part was funnier and more successful than Will Smith's. Made in America is hardly a classic but is worth watching if you like a little maturity in your comedy. plenty of good humor in it.  The best part is the filming of the commercials.  Who would have thought that a shoot that goes horribly wrong would produce footage much better than what was intended?  Also, Nia Long is BEAUTIFUL.  Out of all the films I've seen, I think this one is a hair above average. he's also an obnoxious and pompous car salesman. Naturally, complications ensue when her mother makes it clear that she requested a black donor. Cast is talented and enthusiastic, setup is very clever and has the makings of a really enjoyable comedy, but unfortunately they're wasted on a sorry script that repeatedly resorts to dumb, sitcom-style humor. A real shame. ** "	5.0	0

Baldwin's ability to jump from utterly charming to incredibly chilling in the blink of an eye is on full display here; it is truly the performance of a lifetime.See it once for the suspense, and again for the acting. you will not be disappointed! The background musical score is one of the most memorable that I have heard in any movie. Malice is a tale of arrogance, power, mystery, and deception, that must be seen and will be long remembered after the final credits roll.This is a very fine film that does not get the credit that it deserves! and Baldwin roles respectively. Typically, the move from low-budget TV-movie to Hollywood blockbuster has brought the expected revisions and 'beefing up' of the script. Everything added was extraneous and served no real purpose.

Watch it, and I think you'll agree. not be achieved without a slow build, but still this movie is one of the best suspense movies out there.

And the murder mystery is very intelligent, fun and stylish mystery-comedy.

This is a comedy that actually has a story, and Woody has the best lines. If you don't like Woody's style though you won't like this, but if you have seen Annie Hall or any of his other movies and liked them then you should love this one.Zoopansick well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein.I loved it. 	7.4	0
Menace II Society (1993)	ignorance of his surroundings, instead choosing to head down a dead-end path. Violent, almost unbearable at times, but faultlessly acted by the cast, and filled with powerful, authentic scenes. Tate is an absolute powerhouse as Turner's younger, impulsive, and extremely cold-blooded pal. Obviously not for all tastes, but a monumental achievement regardless, thanks to a superior cast of actors. ***½ all the ghetto films made, in fact the film at times feels like we are on a documentary drive around downtown Watts. Menace II Society, however brutal it clearly is, has loaded the gun and shot the bullet, only to see it narrowly miss the whole target it was aiming for. Still it's one hell of an experience though. 8/10 an excellent film that you should see if you ever get the chance. It has a good message, and it has some very moving moments in it.

One of the small cast of that film is Wallace Shawm, star of  `My Dinner with Andre,' which has been mentioned her by another reviewer. As he says, `What Happened Was' is on similar territory to `Andre,' but it's much more somber and doesn't give that `redeeming' feeling at its end. Demanding and rewarding. 	7.0	0

Perhaps these were originally to be explored in a little more depth.I suppose this ""accountant's cut"" didn't do well enough at the box office for there to be much chance of a director's cut and that's a shame. It seems there is a much better film somewhere in here screaming to be let out.... and the frequent fades-away which, in my opinion, manifest a little hastiness by the director, I found the picture full of hope.

Then this is the equivalent of the Blues for the eyes and food for thought. Cheers Mr Leigh. simply a movie with teeth but one with rabid, venomous, acid-tipped fangs, tearing and gnashing at our pompous ideas about our own natures.There are many movies which are fantastically enjoyable and make for a sterling night out with friends and family. This is not one of them. Naked is disturbing, unpleasant, frightening and utterly bleak. It is also quite brilliant. his actions would be deemed illegal in real life - if you have seen the film.)What happens to the on-screen people the day after this film ends?

Round-Up.Mesmerizing and fast-paced, there is no shortage of excellence in the smaller plots and characters: Greg Cruttwell is spectacular as the pompous, nouveau-riche Jeremy, and the two female leads, Leslie Sharp and Katrin Cartlidge provide well balanced juxtaposition as two very different femmes damaged.Not for the faint of heart, Naked will test one's own philosophy, and leave you stripped bare. shows Mike Leigh as a master of his art, expressed by the unique performances he elicits from his cast.

During the course of all this, Tolkin gets plenty of jabs in about an American economy that seems to be teetering on wisps of hope rather than on any true productivity.

It's pretty interesting all the way through, it has some good, 80's style action, corny B-movie lines, a B-movie feel throughout the movie... so, if you can watch it for free, either borrow it from a friend, or watch it on TV... if not, only watch it if you're into movies like Fortress. 6/10 name... Plus the 'two faction-one nice, one evil' has overtones of Lord of the Flies. While both of the above comments are applicable, the film rises above itself. With good performances from powerful actors such as Ray Liotta and Stuart Wilson, along with a sharp script, 'No Escape' is a hidden gem, and well worth seeking out. Final Score: 7.5/10 who stars as the resident beer Maker.Unfortunately the film bombed on both sides of the Atlantic taking a measly $15m in the states and a pathetic £500,000 here in the UK on it's original release 10 years ago but don't let that put you off it's very well acted with plenty of action and Drama.My Rating:- **** out of ***** good job of playing a violent anti-hero. There are some great battle scenes and fun supporting performances.Overall there isn't really much else to say about ""No Escape"", apart from you will be entertained if you enjoy action films that you can't take too seriously. If I'm objective I can't score it very highly but for entertainment value it gets 4/5. you like action, B-movies with a touch of sci-fi and want something to eat popcorn to, give this one a try. You can pick it up pretty cheaply or even stream it from many a website.Plus, is it just me, or are all the computer terminals straight out of 'Aliens?'

Carousel.Paramount got it's number one star and biggest recording star in America at the time, Bing Crosby, to make a record of it. Bing's record sold well, but the big hit came from Peggy Lee. I'm surprised that Marlene didn't sing a full version in the film, it's just her kind of material.Could have definitely helped the film a lot. the censor decided to give them a break! One goof--at the beginning, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the American pronunciation. (The English say ""leftenant."") Since Milland was British, he must have been saying it that way because the American movie-makers feared that American audiences would be distracted and confused by the British style. is exceptional in that Marlene & Raymond present outstanding performances. The acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production, but the script, direction, and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars.

Rebecca (1940)	"sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too ""old fashioned"", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'Rebecca'! so well that it's strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock's films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her. Few other movies affect me so emotionally - one of them is Vertigo.All in all, this is a fantastic piece of film-making from Hollywood's golden age. Laurence Olivier is in top-form, as he plays the quiet, sad Maxim and George Sanders is positively hateful.10/10 - a visceral masterpiece Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel.  Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that.  Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces. untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be.

If you're a fan of escapist, thrilling adventures populated by superb characters (see George Sanders as ffolliot, and Robert Benchley as Stebbins) you will be delighted. This is one of Hitch's lesser seen gems and deserves to be rediscovered without delay to any of his films.  Particularly good are the memorable windmill scenes and the exciting climactic sequence in mid-ocean.

At this point ""Foreign Correspondent"" becomes an inventive chase thriller, darting across the audiences' eyes at a berserk chase.

I look forward to this film making it's DVD debut! cherubic and cheerful hit man you've ever seen! The final scene was strictly American propaganda, but that can probably be forgiven considering the subject matter of the film and the time of it's release.All in all, a wonderful example of the master at his best, that deserves to be dusted off and enjoyed alongside some of it's more celebrated cousins!

As in all great films, it is a spot-on rendering of its own unique story in the ambiance of its own time, but timeless in its portrayal of human character and emotion. Like a handful of others, it is as satisfying a movie experience now as it was 40 years ago...probably more so...whether on first viewing or 40th. scheming mother.NOTORIOUS is intense and meticulously crafted, and benefits from the best acting in any Hitchcock movie.  While NORTH BY NORTHWEST or THE 39 STEPS might be a better introduction to Hitchcock for people used to the slam-bang action of modern cinema, NOTORIOUS is the best I can recommend for those who have already learned to love Hitchcock's work. even more complicated figure. Screenwriter Ben Hecht and Hitchcock team up for some pretty intense moments in `Notorious', and compliment each others styles and talents wonderfully. There are not many nail-biting moments in `Notorious', but the script is excellent.  Coupled with the superior acting and direction, `Notorious' is certainly a Hitchcock film that should not be missed.  --Shelly her to do some of her own interpretation, particularly early on during the ""character-building"" scenes (before the plot moves all the characters into their appointed places on the chessboard).

It is also worth watching for the famous Salvador Dali dream sequence, which is very creatively done and fascinating to watch.  Peck and Bergman also create interesting and sympathetic characters, who make the viewer want to know what will happen to them.Overall, this is a distinctive film, and well worth seeing for any Hitchcock fan. to recover hisfull memory.7.It's a technically astounding movie,as in every Hitch movie:it features the shortest color scene (it's a black and white movie)in cinema.And I won't tell you when it appears,watch out.8.It's a movie from the Master of suspense,and I trade you ""a lapse of memory"",""shattered"" and ""the third day "" for ""Spellbound""!It deserves to be in the top 250! to clear the patient's name.Brilliant camera work and being filmed in black & white really helped the story line. There is an eye opening dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali that is down right mystic.The strong and talented cast also includes: Regis Toomey, Leo G. Carroll and Rhonda Fleming. This film is worth the time to watch again and again. need only compare this film with his very next one, NOTORIOUS, to be painfully aware how much better Hitchcock on his own -- using his own standards of pace, momentum and the ADULT treatment of script themes -- could be when not under the thumb of Selznick.

I give this movie a definite 10. is very slowly unraveled in layers until the peak of the scene, scored by the emotional title theme song. This scene ""gets"" one every time, that's how effective it is. Beautiful costumes, scenery, clever photography (note the scene where the open patio door reveals the Empire State Building in its reflection), great cast make this an enduring, never-forgotten golden classic. this film  around Valentine's Day (even if you are single) is always a treat. It  allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are  actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in  a thunderstorm.  Watch with a box of Kleenex nearby.  My rating: 4 stars demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie, or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species. and corny, but part of its allure is that it is not too realistic. It gives us an escape into the ideal world where everyone is good looking and charming.

Rating : Above average , this Hitchcock effort proved to be as successful as his former popular movies. same can be said for the chic Jessie Royce Landis, who always showed she was a smart and elegant actress.While this is a film so different from most of his other films, Mr. Hitchcock shows a great affinity for comedy in it. This proved to be a pause in his distinguished career to amuse his public. How well he succeeded! fantasia, the director's vacation from his more typical material. While it will never compete with the more famous VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW of the same period, it is extremely well done and quite a bit of fun to watch.

Father of the Bride (1950)	"amusing... Torn by jealousy, Tracy is all good-natured father exhausted by the complete weight of the problems leading up to the happy day...But it's an ensemble show, and as the typical spoiled daughter of a typical mid-American bourgeois, Elizabeth has one of her joyful screen moments, altering and urging her beloved ones with such gentle, persuasive, winning, and gracious manners... cast is excellent. Leo G. Carroll is good as the befuddled caterer, Melville Cooper does a funny bit as the church deacon and the still beautiful Billie Burke along with Moroni Olsen appear as the parents of the Groom.""Father of the Bride"" under the able direction of Vincente Minnelli, is the kind of family comedy that we rarely see anymore. poignancy, especially in the last few sequences where the parents dance together in the post-party mess of their once-pristine house.  This kind of thing puts the movie above the ordinary, and is exactly what was missing in the Steve Martin remake years later.And don't let me forget Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen as the groom's parents - really funny! from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other. here. I kind of like that. Daffy Duck did that, with hilarious results. So did Groucho Mark. It made us, the audience, feel we were involved with wedding, too.All in all, still a good film which holds up reasonably well if you can look at it as a farce, and a comment with weddings - something that will never change!

Band Wagon, The (1953)	"the pas-de-deux of ""Dancing In The Dark."" It's an exquisite sequence, which at times resembles courtship, foreplay, and ultimately a romantic climax- all done in dance. It ends, just as smoothly as it began, with the two leads spinning up a short flight of stairs and mounting a hansom cab, without a single hair out of place. Now THAT's entertainment. 'Girl Hunt' is so inventive and perfectly executed that you can't help thinking these two dancers really *do* match somehow.Simply put, you just couldn't go wrong with THE BAND WAGON. You'll laugh, you'll marvel, you'll sing along... but most of all, you'll be well-entertained. And if *that's* the point the film is trying to make... point surely very well-taken! 8/10 dance with the shoeshine boy, Le Roy Daniels; anything featuring Cyd Charisse - and those wonderful musical numbers, ranging from the anthem 'That's Entertainment' to the hilarious 'Triplets'.'The Band Wagon' sends up the old film staple plot ""putting on a show"" and does it brilliantly, thanks to the crackling Comden/Green script.  One of MGM's best musical efforts, hugely enjoyable. Charisse comes into her own.  Apart from being arguably the best female dancer in Hollywood history, she was certainly the most beautiful: the scene in the ballet in which she appears on a bar stool and slips off her coat to reveal a dramatic red dress oozes with as much sex appeal as any movie moment I've ever seen. and those marvelous songs that come one after another to delight eye and ear! And give Jack Buchanan a hand for squeezing every bit of ham from a role that calls for it, in spades!Almost forgot: the opening ""Shine on Your Shoes"" number set in Times Square is a howl! The only black seen anywhere is the shoeshine man himself. "	7.6	1
Ninotchka (1939)	and one that doesn't feel the need to beat us over the head with it. The relationship is well-developed, the characters interesting, and the execution top-notch. For me personally, the film lacks something that would render it a 10/10 classic, but that certainly isn't indicative of its quality as a romantic comedy. A great way to spend an evening. 8/10. satire are soft, more Noel Coward than propaganda.My lament is not seeing more comedy from Garbo. She made such serious and tragic films, when she could have been making us laugh. The film is dated, yes, but Garbo herself shines through along with her three Russian accomplices. I think that Billy Wilder and Garbo would have been a great team while they are thrown with accuracy, their sting is never such that the satire sinks into the mire of political ideology. NINOTCHKA, after all, is about the triumph of love over politics, and to those who feel trapped in the prevailing toilet-ethic of the Farrelly Brothers' blood-poisoning of modern comedy, represents a much-needed antidote. Inoculate yourself at your earliest opportunity. masterly, but not 'ground-breaking', a fault for which some are willing to run him under the harrow -- a case of holding someone to impossible standards. Nobody can break new ground in every film -- sometimes we have to settle for mere masterly competence. See this film! Unless you happen to romanticize the former Soviet Union, you will enjoy it. her laugh, and from that moment on, she's a delight. For an example of just how good a comedienne Garbo could be, watch Ninotchka's face as Douglas's character tells her corny joke after corny joke in an attempt to win a smile from her; or the scene set in a nightclub when Ninotchka discovers the capitalist wonders of champagne.Grade: A+ 	8.0	1
Love in the Afternoon (1957)	"one afloat. There are also some very good sequences in the screenplay, for all that it was uneven in general. The odd thing about ""Love in the Afternoon"" is that if you can tolerate the poor setup and get past the obvious flaws, you can really enjoy most of the movie, because it does have several positive things to offer. he had tremendous difficulty in shooting the picnic and row boat scenes. It seems as though the location was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and they were unmerciful to cast and crew. Wilder took several takes just to get enough usable footage.Audrey Hepburn fans will be mad for Love in the Afternoon, Gary Cooper's though might wince when seeing it. spunky in one of her best performances. The song ""Fascination"" is used to great effect. Filmed in 1957, the only way to show the title occurrence is to have a camera shot following Hepburn's dis-robed fur coat falling to the hotel room's floor, as she embraces Cooper. The ending is suspenseful, with cute narration epilogue by Chevalier. A wonderful film. of age; it's about chemistry and personality. Bogart in ""Sabrina"" offered the same problem, though less so. As an example of another pairing that worked well despite a sizable age difference, consider Stewart and Kelly in ""Rear Window"".Frankly, I'm surprised that such obviously poor pairings plague numerous films, but apparently some believe that box office draws can overcome such issues. I don't think he could have pulled off the 2nd and 3rd act, and Cooper did. When he's sad (dictaphone/wine cart/sauna scenes) he's a top form comic actor.  Anyways - I digress.No one can produce the feeling of heartache with so much sadness and glee as Wilder can. The gypsy band should have earned a best supporting actors nomination. "	7.3	0

This movie has often served as an introduction to Maurice Chevalier for movie watchers, and he illuminates the screen. If you want to see him in another of the greatest musicals, watch ""Love Me Tonight"" with Jeanette MacDonald.Thank heaven for this movie - it's a world that I would love to inhabit! I give it 10 out of 10. cannot tell you how many times I have heard that beautiful song in my head as he has discovered his Gigi is a ""woman"" now and not a child. My sister and I will forever keep this movie close to our hearts. I suggest anyone who is a romantic or loves musicals to go and rent this one right away!! any other personality performing these songs?Jourdan is perfect in his role and so is Gingold. Thank heaven!!! Lastly, I must pay homage to that city on the Seine. It is the ultimate star and should have gotten a special award.I agree with those readers that have called Gigi the best Hollywood musical; it is really the perfect musical. Thank heaven!!! as a typical MGM fluff piece, could be a hard sell, particularly to the jaded Generation Y - and - younger audience. However, since I myself am probably one of the most cynical film-viewers I personally know of, take my word for it  ""Gigi"" is a lot of fun, and a good way to spend two hours. 8/10 --Shelly "	6.8	0

And the interior sets are equally beautiful. can relate. Sandra likes Saxon and sneaks out to see him. A wonderfully hilarious comedy~ Don't miss this movie. You will be glad you saw it. Go buy it because you are going to want to see it over and over again. I think I will slip my copy in the VCR now and  enjoy this movie too. Enjoy! According to Mr. Harrison's autobiography, he knew his wife was dying, but she did not know. This movie is a wonderful valentine Rex Harrison gave to his wife, Kay Kendall.A few years earlier, Kay Kendall made a very funny movie, ""Simon and Laura"" with Peter Finch.  Movie is not available on video, so watch  for it on television. comic timing is superb and so is her dress sense! She looks totally fabulous in this film. It's terribly sad to see it and realize that she had not long to live. Film comedy lost a jewel in her.According to the closing credits of 'What Every Girl Wants', 'The Reluctant Debutante' inspired that lamentable movie. Don't watch that; watch this! pretty funny and quite romantic. I think most of this is due to good writing and the nice gentle nature of the film. In fact, the longer I watched it, the more I liked it and found myself really being pulled into the story. It's a very good and often overlooked film--pity, as it really should be more widely seen.

Adventures of Robin Hood, The (1938)	"with Errol Flynn.As she watched it she saw the reverence and respect the audience had for both of these classics. When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now, she was real proud to have been associated with these films.You have every reason to be proud Olivia. And we're real proud of you. Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here, everything works. Other than Erroll Flynn - even if when's he is on the screen is difficult to pay attention to anyone else - we do. Mostly because Claude Rains, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and the rest of the sensational cast.

He vows that Robin must be captured...Winner of 3 Academy Awards (Art Direction, Original Score and Film Editing) ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is a delighted tale of high adventure, a tale of action and colorful pageantry, a great film for all the family... as it was seventy years ago, when it won its Academy Award. From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel, when Robin and Gisbourne meet ""once too often"", this picture richly deserves its reputation as *the* Robin Hood on film - from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned. tremendously wide variety of types.

Mark of Zorro, The (1940)	"unheard music... With a touch of a great filmmaker, Mamoulian mixes harmoniously movement and action, decor and lightning with rage and turmoil, heroism and romance...Under Alfred Newman's Oscar-Nominated score and despite the unusual absence of Technicolor, the film (the first of the great Tyrone Power swashbucklers ) is great fun, full of vitality and suspense, an exciting, deliciously ironic swashbuckler... fun film with great dialogue and should be on everyone's ""must see"" list.  One curious thing.......how did those very revealing tight pants worn by Power and Rathbone get by the Hays Office?  These were the days when you could not even show a married couple sharing the same bed and those pants didn't leave much to the imagination! when it was discovered that Fox only had the rights to the title, THE MARK OF ZORRO; the name 'Zorro' belonged to another studio, ending any possibility of a follow-up).Tyrone Power had joined Errol Flynn as the reigning 'kings' of swashbucklers, a title both would find amusing, if limiting, but which would be how both actors are best remembered, today! two years before. Linda Darnell is so sweet and beautiful that seems to be the inspiration for the title of the novel of Vladimir Nabokov. J. Edward Bromberg and Basil Rathbone are the perfect villains, the first one coward and sleazy and the second arrogant and corrupt. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Marca do Zorro"" (""The Mark of Zorro"") Why can't they make action flicks like this anymore? To paraphrase a certain famous political catchphrase, ""it's the characters, stupid."" Everybody in this movie is colorful and cool, and through them I get wrapped up in the plot. When the biggest complaint I have is a bit of rear-screen projection during a boat ride, you know the movie's almost perfect. "	7.6	1
Laura (1944)	Laura are coming true, as she appears through the doorway. He awakens and rises from the chair, his soul shaken by the sight of Laura alive.This intriguing story, combined with Clifton Webb's biting quips, Gene Tierney's beauty and elegance, Dana Andrews' intensity and dark good looks, and Vincent Price's sense of humor, makes this film immensely watchable again and again. to fall for Laura posthumously.  Clifton Webb plays her mentor perfectly and Vincent Price is classic as Laura's pretty boy fiance.  Although the movie begins with Laura's murder, it still has incredible surprises and an awesome denouement.  Andrews hard boiled detective and the dark, raining sets illustrate the meaning of film noir.  I highly recommend it. it keeps you thoroughly absorbed until it reaches its satisfying climax under Otto Preminger's knowing direction. Not to be missed, it's a classic of its kind.For a detailed look at the career of DANA ANDREWS, see my current article on him in FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE, Summer 2001 with a look at all of his films and many photos.   Even upon multiple viewings I can't help but howl at some of his lines and mannerisms.  If anyone was to request suggestions for good Film Noir movies, I would prescribe a heavy dose of `Laura' because it has something for everyone in that it is romantic, thrilling, mysterious, wickedly funny and above all, thoroughly entertaining.  --Shelly of sophisticated noir police drama. It's dialog will leave you begging for more. It's not much in the way of mystery because about a third of the way through you will realize at the same time Andrews does who the murderer is, maybe even before Andrews does. That doesn't matter though because Laura is entertaining every step of the way. 	8.1	1

From here the love story begins; we see the mutual respect and admiration that Captain Gregg and Mrs. Muir have for eachother.The love is pure and true,on a higher plane; not hindered  or comprimised by sexual intimacy.The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is a love story that like its characters transcends time. score that is as moving and powerful as the tides that beat throughout this film.I find a personal connection to this story in that it takes me back to the days I lived on a northern island that was similarly beautiful though tinged with the bittersweet loneliness of a remote place awash in the deep undercurrents of sorrow and melancholy. the sea. Mr. Harrison plays well opposite Ms. Tierney; their chemistry works well because it combines his rugged good looks and her beauty.The supporting players are good under Mr. Mankiewicz' direction.

Horton's anger at Mitchell when he learned the latter's identity is understandable. Mitchell's involvement in installing new pipes in Shangri-La mirrors Insull's early days, when he was an electrician, and an assistant to Thomas Edison.The use of these two real figures as the basis of the characters helped contemporary audiences to accept the background of the plot of the film. and Champlin more in awe of the result. There is even an alternative ending included that Columbia chief Harry Cohn insisted on filming and using upon release, but it had thankfully been dropped two weeks later. This is a genuine treat for cinemaphiles, as there are few films that make such a compelling case for seeking out one's personal utopia. Shortly after he turns to look at Shangri-La for the last time before plunging into the outside world and again, silently, his emotions touch us all. (At least they touch me!) We are very fortunate to have this masterpiece available to us. Now, will future generations recognize this film for what it is? Judging from today's ""hits"" I really wonder. "	7.8	1
Top Hat (1935)	"so you can finally say that you've seen a Fred/Ginger movie, and now know what all that fuss was about. Because, goodness, there really is nothing quite so magical as when Astaire takes Rogers in his arms and spins her around a dance floor, defying gravity and all laws of motion. Physics means nothing when it comes to these two... amusing.  Edward Everett Horton is both funny and indispensable as Fred's friend (and the man whom Ginger thinks Fred is), and the rest of the supporting players are also quite good.This is the kind of carefully produced classic that offers many reasons for watching - see it if you have the chance, whether or not you usually like musicals. Swing Time, Shall We Dance, and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle and The Barkleys of Broadway, the last two because they had quite plausible stories, (and in the case of Castle, one based on real life).  But still, Top Hat is Fred and Ginger at their best, and hopefully will always stay that way in my mind. Horton, Helen Broderick, and Eric Blore. These three character actors are at their finest in the film. They make everything work because they are always there to lend a hand for the stars to shine without being on the way.""Top Hat"" is a happy film that keeps delighting viewers any time one is lucky enough to fall under its spell. from his wife Madge for 24 hours, even though they haven't met for weeks and they are staying in the same hotel.  This is highly artificial, but such flaws are rendered negligible by the sweeping climax of ""Cheek To Cheek"", the splendid finale in which Fred and Ginger get to dance as lovers.Verdict - Immortal stylish music and dance.

James Dean put himself 'out there' emotionally in such a raw way that the power of that brave acting yet holds the ability to touch the audience with every viewing.  I think the film makes a hugely important statement about the human condition that is still valid a half a century later. distant to the viewer, for example, which is appropriate to the final state of his character, but which could have been explained better in transformation.But this is a fabulous film, with grand, biblical and universal subtexts and an unusually developed but extremely charming romance. Unless you're completely averse to realist drama, you must see East of Eden at least once. so long for me to finally see this movie, but I was impressed. (May I recommend the two-disc, special-edition DVD?). This movie is wonderfully directed, acted and photographed.

Thin Man, The (1934)	"that all the movies they worked together on were made at frantic pace. Part of the reason that The Thin Man moves so quickly is the fact that production was so hurried.The Thin Man gets a ten out of ten from me for being one of the best films ever produced, and one of my absolute favorites of all time. a comic masterpiece that continually tricks the viewers, and without a doubt, one of the very best and brightest movies of the 1930s. I hope I can watch the other ""Thin Man"" movies. I will definitely be reading the book. The film ended half an hour ago, but I already feel like going back for a second helping. Rating: 10/10 is so thoroughly enjoyable, and its stars (including Asta) are so engaging that I look forward to seeing more in the six-film series. Rent this one or catch it on Turner Classic Movies, like I did. It is well worth seeing, and surely an inspiration to many film genres ranging from screwball comedies to detective stories. A very strong 8/10.--Shelly remembers him. 'Do you know anything about the case?' 'Yes, it's putting me way behind in my drinking.'

A real winner.Camera Obscura --- 9/10 science, swindles, two dinner parties and drinking... lots and lots of drinking... all combine into one hell of fun movie.

He was right! see the film it's a chance to see a lot of great cinema names at one time doing real characters instead of just walking on as themselves.The film holds up well today and can still be enjoyed.

It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful... a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas. strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter.

The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5. sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches.  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.  And in giving this rating, either I'm damn right or I'm crazy. about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart's troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well.

One scene after another at breakneck pace, but never a dull moment.  As soon as one laugh stops, another one begins.  In case you haven't gotten the point, I highly suggest you see this movie.  It may be 60 years old, but it's still hilarious. couldn't describe it in any event.May Robson and Charlie Ruggles lend good support. Ruggles who was normally cast against Mary Boland teams up well with May Robson. And my favorite in the supporting cast is Walter Catlett as the small town constable who doesn't know quite what he has on his hands, but is determined to bluff the situation through. he plays George, who, barking his stubby tail off, has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this high-strung wire-haired terrier is and will forever be (pace Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie) Hollywood's top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby, the most exquisite comedy of the sound era. "	8.0	1

The ending was a complete surprise. If you like Cary Grant or old Hollywood movies, this is something different. Sad, but sentimental. Recommended. This film is a gift to the audience. Grant and Dunne show their adeptness at establishing and making us believe they are an intimate married couple. Irene Dunne is at the height of sensitivity and softness here, a true lady with beautiful hair and hairstyles. What a movie. And one cannot forget our beloved Apple Jack, such a sweet soul. there may be a few moments when the sentimentality gets dangerously high, most of the time it remains balanced, and certainly more so than is the case with present-day movies of this kind.  It's far from flawless, but it is generally effective in telling the kind of story that takes a combination of sensitivity and restraint to tell believably. his adopted baby girl, it brings a lump to my throat every time I see it. Irene Dunne was a classy lady in anything she did, and can be as quietly funny as she can be dramatic, as she demonstrated in this film.

Of Human Bondage (1934)	"barrage of blood-curdling insults. Bette Davis as Mildred never fails to raise the hair on the back of my neck and arms with her performance in this particular scene.This is the role that made Davis a star. It's also one of my all-time favorite Davis films, along with such others as ""The Little Foxes"", ""The Letter"", and ""All About Eve"". Howard's Philip Carey is a shy man with a deep inferiority complex because of his club foot. He clings to Mildred because even though she's degraded him, he feels he'll never find another attachment again. For both the leads Of Human Bondage represented a considerable stretching of considerable talents. The two later screen versions are markedly inferior to this one. shocking for it's day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred's vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him (""You cad, you dirty swine...."") is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film. when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: ""I wiped my mouth! I WIPED MY MOUTH!!"" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental.IMDb votes concur! that I didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. They'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would have never been interested in Mildred. That's just the simple truth... See it!! "	7.3	0

It deserves far better treatment than it has received since its copyright lapsed. done for TV back in 1980, but fell flat.  So bad was that version, that they should pay you to watch it.  Yet if someone was to do it correctly today, they would have a real gem on their hands.If you haven't seen the original 1946 version, catch it on TV.  It belongs in everybody's movie-watching repertoire. She may be his salvation.

Lots of good character actors playing brawny devils, lunkheaded mooks, tough dames, flustered Man Fridays and such.

Definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the oldies. patient but suffering fiancée, endeavoring to understand the difference in the judge's personality. As the Devil, Claude Rains is inspired casting.

But it's the kind of story that's easy to watch over again when it is told the right way. beauty???!!! I have little faith in our rapidly decaying culture as we enter the new century, especially when such travesties occur. Once again, there is absolutely NO valid, logical excuse for this.

They Made Me a Criminal (1939)	as a tough New York cop?).Busby Berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers.  The film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed.  The ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but I still found this a highly enjoyable experience. the start of the movie. Why knowing that Jack/Johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.  Berkeley would never settle for a point-and-shoot look to his film.  His camera is all over the place, even underwater when the kids take over a water tank.  There's all the stock characters of old cinema her e- the nice girl who softens Garfield's heart, the spry old grannie, the tough NYC cops and reporters. Fun movie. and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.Other performances besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield's trail. as a tough-cop character that doesn't really make the best use of his strengths.In keeping everything together and on-track, Busby Berkeley shows the same kind of skill that enabled him to produce the variety numbers for which he was better known. He comes in for his share of the credit here in creating an interesting movie with some unusual features. 	7.0	0

Films today just don't use actors with faces like his any longer.  Too bad.Yes indeed, The Angel and The Badman is a wonderful, old fashioned  film. The kind they don't make any longer, but should. Capra disparaged Grant as a bad influence on Wayne when they quarreled during the filming of Circus World. Grant did write some of the more conservative on Wayne's films. But I certainly can't fault anything he did in The Angel and the Badman.In fact it's a winner in just about every respect. Even some Wayne haters might like this one. natural ""Angelic"" qualities. The camera really loves her. There's one scene where she confesses' her love for Wayne, and is surprised he doesn't feel quite the same: ""I never thought it could happen to one and not another."" Her outright innocence in this scene is incredibly touching, and endearing, and you see how this affects Wayne in the same way. Wayne constantly threatening him, but almost like a self-appointed guardian who sees Quirt's potential for good, trying to steer him toward the light. Carey's humor, and good spirit plays off Wayne perfectly.The film builds to a brilliant finish, with Quirt forced to choose between peace or violence once and for all. One of my favorite westerns. Great cast, great story. as the marshall, he's constantly stalking Quirt. He's sure that someday he'll get to hang the guy, and he harps on it constantly. The chemistry between Wayne and Russell adds an unexpected poignancy to the film. The scene where the two pick blackberries is simply beautiful, and their wordless climactic exchange is perfectly performed. Good action sequences, as well. 9/10. "	7.0	0

Most action in this movie takes place off camera, this creates a feeling of 'being there.' One character mentions that all the action he has seen he had to listen to it.

Outlaw, The (1943)	the actors are painful in their beauty. Many of the IMDb comments suggest that the film wants watching several times. I second that.

Toland can be thanked for giving us the movie's clarity. --And Howard... Howard was just having fun. was a lot that didn't fit well at all - including a dreadful musical score and some ham-fisted attempts at humour. The movie also includes surprisingly little gunplay for a Western. There's really not very much of interest here, but for Russell's sheer beauty as well as the over the top bizarre-ness of the whole thing, it gets a 4/10. dreadful (Tchaikovsky was it? mixed with cartoon type sounds) I still found myself admiring Russell, who for most red blooded males of my age has been a great inspiration. Like Shane, and others, I think this was a film of its time, and probably doesn't deserve to be judged by this generation, who are seeing it for the first time. Brothers romp but not nearly as intentionally funny. The whole thing is contrived, there's a lot of talk, talk, talk, and if there is some underlying message, I missed it. BUT, you have to see it for the camp value......it's really more fun than it should be. Maybe Mr. Hughes meant it that way. On second thought, I guess not. two years to pass the censors due to the shameless display of Russell's ample assets(36D).

Night of the Living Dead (1968)	"the lead character. Romero has always presented intelligent non-stereotypical black characters in his films. This film was made in 1968 while civil rights tensions were high, and the most ""in control"" character in the whole movie is a black man. If you can get past a couple of cheesy supporting performances, this is one of the best horror films ever. of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this. made). The film is still effective because it all has a feeling of impending doom. It seems hopeless, disturbing, terrifying because of the claustrophobic mood it sets. It's not the zombies that scare us, it's the idea of being trapped in a small area with nowhere to go and death itself standing right outside your door. What a brilliant film!8/10 unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage.  Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben - who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat, realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion.  An excellent flagship for low budget horrors. through the rest of this film and the two superb sequels that followed.This is perhaps one of the greatest low budget cult movies ever made, certainly one of the most influential, and in its brutally harrowing documentary style conclusion a harsh statement on American racial attitudes.

Some viewers may not get the joke--much of BEAT THE DEVIL requires the ability to appreciate covert humor--but those who do will find the movie bears repeat viewing. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer right?).The resolution is lame - the characters all look ready to leave the set and get drunk before undertaking a new film.  But this is one of the best spoofs of the noir genre and what makes it fly is the ensemble of first-rate actors in roles neatly the opposite of those they were usually seen performing.Rent it! (Please) for being unrealistic, Huston's and Capote's comic script has none-to-funny real parallels in the present day debacles of Enron and WorldCom. In ""Beat the Devil,"" greed and deceit are brilliantly juxtaposed to reveal the ultimate folly of even the most devious criminal enterprise. This is a superior black comedy that plays even better today than it did 52 years ago. Devil ground (Zoolander), but none of them ever reach it for fear of the audience not getting it, as I understand most of Beat the Devils audience of 1954 did not get it. Imagine Mike Myers playing Austin Powers straight, and not trying to be funny in all the situations he's in. To me, that would be immensely more funny. case, Bogart gave an immensely satisfying performance in his tongue-in-cheek role and the film itself has now become a regular attraction in Bogart film retrospectives...

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)	"remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a very appropriate title.  It is a searing, wonderfully acted film that I will not soon forget.  I recommend those who haven't seen it yet to rent it as soon as they get a chance.  A true classic. Williams's stuff is talky, and with the drabness of a typical Williams set, this can be a bit oppressive. With color, and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters, his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended, I think he has given us something just as fine. Mae's personalities, even those which bespeak traditional values, are portrayed as petty and unimaginative.  Even if one believes that Gooper and Mae have done all the right things, they have done them for the wrong reasons. Thus the theme of the story is most clearly presented:  all that is important is to love and to express that love. right and Taylor certainly doesn't disappoint in the role. But it turns out that ultimately the film is really about the relationship between Brick and his father, not Brick and his wife. And as such it is Newman, and most especially Ives, who you will most remember. It is their work which transforms a good movie into something truly memorable. are breathtakingly beautiful in their portrayals. This is probably not a good family movie, as Brick has a serious drinking problem and Maggie IS so desperate for his affections, and probably not a good Friday/Saturday night movie, but I still love it, and will think of it fondly for the rest of my life.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.

This heady, romanticized peek into the life of Americans abroad has its allure, and, though you don't believe it for a minute, it makes you want to sip a Pastis and light up a Gitane. strong women who fill the screen with power and grace.  But with `Far From Heaven' and `The Hours' I may be wrong about forever.   I recommend this admittedly dated but charming film for anyone who wants to see what screen acting is all about. It is about thinking and Miss Taylor is a master at the craft. an older man now...57 years old.  I had to reach for my hanky several times.  The love...the joy...the tears... and the sorrow of a man for his wife and his child. Well...well...it is too bad they don't have movies like this anymore.  I miss them.

Meet John Doe (1941)	"the role of Fascist D.B. Norton. This film is even more relevant today than when it was made, and I would argue that it should be viewed in high schools across the continent. Capra is asking his viewers to think critically of EVERYTHING they hear on the radio or see in papers or hear from elites, and amen to that! find all your views being voiced by different characters at various points in the tale, opening the question of just who is the average everyman that Capra is seeking to show? - and how do they relate to you?This movie is ten stars all over. Even for keen Capra fans, the expectation is surpassed by the final delivery. Thoroughly recommended. when the rest of the film is way ahead of the game.Like the equally dark `It's a Wonderful Life,' Capra's genius is that he knows how to pitch and score the important points when necessary, not only with laughter and tears, but with unyielding hope and, most significantly, with words.  It's more than any home crowd can ask for. and langs techniques in this work are absoloutly astounding. The riot scene should be looked upon as ground breaking. The performances (both the lead and supporting) are among some of the finest and most endearing of the time. Needless to say I'm going to be toot this films horn for quite some time.

Finally, the movie succeeds not just because of its attributes that can carry over to other forms of art such as books or plays, but also because it is a uniquely cinematic experience. "	7.7	1
Algiers (1938)	"third film version of Pepe Le Moko's story with Casbah starring Tony Martin. It was a musical version that fell short of establishing Martin as a big screen draw, but the songs were some of his best selling records.Still though Boyer does a fabulous job as Pepe, though I would some day like to see Jean Gabin's version for comparison. film that have become famous over the years and it's fun just looking for things that you've heard or seen before. I'm not sure how much Warner Brother's cartoons based their stinky skunk (Pepe le Pew) on Charles Boyer's character Pepe le Moko but there has be some correlation.Anyway, Algiers is a grand piece of entertainment well worth the watching. marry an elderly wide-girthed fellow; my goodness, for her anything's better than that! There's a youngish Leonid Kinskey also appearing as a supporting actor, along with reliable Alan Hale (formerly Robin Hood's buddy, more or less) and Gene Lockhart, whom I've never seen in such a serious role as this one. It's a movie that stands the test of time. mentioned. Charles Boyer was great as Pepe La Moko, and so was Gene Lochart as the informer. To me, the ending was most tragic, and I will never forget the fading ship sailing away and Hedy's vision, never to see her lover again. No wonder its a classic. They don't make movies like these anymore, the pity of it all. a musical :in what is primarily a film noir,it's thoroughly incongruous.Many of the great lines of the French classic can be heard ,notably the famous ""I'm an informer,I'm not a hypocrite"",and the Boyer/Lamarr pairing displays a special chemistry .The black and white makes a good use of shadows and lights.If all the remakes were made with care like this one.....

Something to Sing About (1937)	Hungarian star set up as Cagney's love interest by the studio press machine. She's neither attractive nor talented, and one has to wonder why she was supposed to be such a big star.This movie is out on DVD, unlike all too many of Cagney's early efforts, and it's worth checking out for a side of Cagney seen entirely too seldom. things and gets down in the dumps about his performances. Little does Terry realize that the producers and directors all like Terry and feel he is doing a great job, but Bennett Regan does not want to tell him that in order to keep him from getting a big head on his shoulders. Great Cagney film with outstanding dance routines. tape and DVD for years and is widely available here..like a lot of weird and small RKO titles. Lucky us and lucky you if you can find them. Grand national was a good outfit. The opening and closing nightclub scenes in this film are really smart and quite elaborate. There's even a BIG-like keyboard dance solo. And that Logo! Wow! trained singer makes for a comely female lead as well, while William Frawley as a press agent, Mona Barrie as the studio diva, and Philip Ahn, who plays Rooney's houseboy, all provide enjoyable turns. Director Victor Schertzinger utilizes his own Academy Award nominated score to a liberal extent throughout and the product becomes a tuneful and rather undervalued musical comedy. Frawley, the future Fred Mertz, of I Love Lucy Fame, steals the picture as a publicity agent hell-bent on getting Cagney stature no matter what the cost.There is that accidental item that could cause a fatal rift between the married couple but Hollywood knew how to settle that so well in a final staging of a song and dance number. 	6.4	0
Farewell to Arms, A (1932)	accent plays Cooper's friend and romantic rival, Major Rinaldi. Menjou was great at playing both American and continental types. Soon he would sign a long term contract with MGM and gain his greatest roles during the sound era.Hemingway purists might shun A Farewell to Arms, but those who love their screen romances, soggier the better will rave about this film. film career of famous stage actress Helen Hayes (1900-1993) at her peak. As it stands, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, a poignant love story, which may not stir up as many tears and sobs as it once did way back when, it is, however, a worthy novel to screen offering, ranking this the first, and best, of two remakes combined. (****) to tears.  How wonderful to see Coop so vulnerable and so in love, and Hayes just shines from the screen like a diamond.This film is very under-rated.  The camerawork is ground-breaking and original - look for the shot when Hayes kisses Cooper as he is wheeled into his hospital room.  Amazing.  I really love this film. Gary Cooper's Frederick is similarly far more animated than Rock Hudson's stony-faced interpretation of the role, and he receives good support from Adolphe Menjou as Frederick's comrade Major Rinaldi. The action is better paced and the film, even if it looks primitive by today's standards, nevertheless has a vigour lacking from many more polished films from more recent times. 7/10 you can find a print of the film that you can stand to watch. It is sad but true: the 1932 A FAREWELL TO ARMS seems to have fallen into public domain, and the result is a host of DVD and VHS releases that range from the merely adequate to the incredibly dire.

Moonlight Murder (1936)	"dubbed by Alfonso Pedroso) was quite good. Most of the singing was okay despite some screechy high notes.A little baby boomer trivia: For us boomers, Carrillo was Pancho on ""The Cisco Kid,"" and the Cisco Kid was Duncan Renaldo - who is listed in the cast here. As a friend of mine used to say, ""foreshadowing."" Ah, Pancho; ah, Cisco. so good about this film? Mainly the short running time combined with, IMHO, an excess of opera music. The time taken up by the opera music could have been used to beef up the plot a bit more. Still I'd recommend it for fans of B murder mysteries from the 30's and 40's and definitely for fans of Chester Morris. part, and I enjoyed watching him. Interesting that Duncan Renaldo (a very attractive young tenor in the film) teamed up with Carillo to play Cisco and Pancho in The Cisco Kid later on. This may be classed as a ""B"" film but there is a great deal of talent here, and Hollywood quality touches (like the truly good singing talent). Universal's 1939 ""The House of Fear"" as well. Director Edwin L. Marin never seemed to escape the 'B' tag (even at MGM), his best remembered features including his debut ""The Death Kiss,"" ""A Study in Scarlet,"" ""Bombay Mail,"" ""The Crosby Case,"" ""The Casino Murder Case,"" ""The Garden Murder Case,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Invisible Agent,"" ""Tall in the Saddle,"" and ""Nocturne."" setup of various characters' motives is rather involved and there is a fair amount of music, as well, so the story itself moves somewhat deliberately. The complicated plot eventually arrives at a surprising (and unlikely) resolution.It's certainly not the best B mystery ever made, but MGM's production values, the somewhat unusual setting, and a fun cast make it very watchable.

Nothing Personal (1995)	to a boiling point, and predictably, the ending is a tragic one. What makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict. Being American, I can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about. But, I do know there has to be a better way.All in all, a well acted, touching...but troubling film. very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores.All in all, it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast. It wont move the earth, although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries. to . It's actually that is very good at portraying a sense of time and place which RESURRECTION MAN failed to do . Like I said this is a very good film that felt the need to over do the dramatics in the last ten minutes which while not totally ruining the film stops it from being a classic one it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. On the other it deals with a Loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10. members are depicted as ruthless terrorists (The devil's own, Patriot games). What all these movies have in common is that the loyalists are not even mentioned. Nothing Personal shows the true nature of the conflict, as a bloody and cruel gang war between the two parties, and on top of that, bloody internal conflicts in the two camps as well. 	6.9	0
Dangerous Ground (1997)	the door of their hotel suite?And there should be a bounty on the head of the person who penned the line ``Steven was in over his head -- but so was the country.''

Shame, shame, shame. feeling like just another gangsta movie.  They touched on the problems of South Africa but ultimately this story could have been set almost anywhere. The South Africa setting is just incidental.  The lines between good & bad are too easily drawn - the characters seem 1 dimensional at times. Different and interesting, but ultimately unfulfilling in some ways. taken up a notch or two. And of course the writing is so thin and predictable if it was a dress it'd be see-through.I don't think it's as horrible as the first reviewer (mainly because I have been to Johannesburg and it DOES look that old an worn-out) but agree that the writing and acting was not up to par. the death of his father, where his family informs him about his brother who has gone missing. Here he meets up with his brother's girlfriend played by Liz Hurley, who is heavily into heroin. They then set about finding his brother, which includes Shooting people, blowing things up, blah, blah, blah. After a while it all gets a bit predictable. dull  the interesting cast make it worth one watch but no more than that.  The mix of `stay in school kids' and `just say no' is too heavy and labourious, but is made even more pointless by the film's conclusion that the best way to deal with criminals destroying an area is to get guns and kill them! 	4.5	0
Picnic (1955)	on for the whole cartoon as Tom follows the dogs and the picnic basket to the woods. You can guess most of the rest. Most of the sight gags are decent: not spectacular, but entertaining enough. A nice twist occurs near the end when an army of ants spots the food and gets in on the fun.Overall, slightly-better than average. a Picnic is rather predictable nonsense, although nice bright and colourful animation goes some way to compensate for the predictable antics of cat, mouse and dogs. The cartoon's best gag is a simple one: Tom's pathetic apologetic laugh when he is caught red handed, although the marching ants that appear at the end of the cartoon are quite fun too. basket(but of course that little mouse is too crafty for him), and the ending with the ants and the food was a funny touch. It is great to see Spike, and his son is really cute. And of course, Tom and Jerry are wonderful as well as per usual. Overall, a really pleasant Tom and Jerry cartoon. 8/10 Bethany Cox 	7.4	0
Madagascar Skin (1995)	"gave ""value added"" as far as I'm concerned.The performances are excellent. The story is compelling and somewhat mysterious. The photography is inventive and evocative.

I'm putting this film in my top ten gay movies list. would read, like the title of an old Stephen Stills song: ""LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH.""  And the actors work wonders with their characters. Bernard Hill is excellent as Flint, while John Hannah takes risks with almost every part he plays.A great film from Channel 4 and the British Film Institute. You'll love it ""as long as you're straight!"" a really good film considering the talent involved.  And I couldn't really believe the basic premise that this attractive man had never experienced sex because of a simple skin defect.  Granted many gay males are overtly narcissistic, but certainly not to that extreme.  And why did Flint suddenly go from 'straight' to 'gay' with no coherent explanation. put in the same flaming suitcase in which the main protagonist cremates a past of shallow pursuits. The pushy symbolism & stylistics (metaphysical shoes on the seashore, dead fish and squids by truckload, ""significant"" tattoos, and - oh, dear - lightnings during first encounter in bed) create a world of no plausibility and suck all blood out of the characters. cannot stand even hints of animal suffering in movies, so when Harry started telling about his job in the research lab I hit the STOP button hard, and I will not go back.I know I will be ridiculed and reviled for writing this, particularly by coolly cynical Europeans if past experience is any indication, but that is just too bad.

Fly Away Home (1996)	here she and Daniels and the minimal dialogue of the script work so well.

That's it. Parents, you can show this to young children without any real concern. My suggestion: Watch the first 5 minutes of the film and if you decide your children can handle the opening sequence of a car crash, then there probably is nothing else in the film that should be a problem (in my opinion!) overwhelming beauty is in their living. They deserved that life. It made me think of this sad planet and the billions of creatures that have died because of the human race. Here was a story that went against the slaughter. When Amy and her birds arrived at their destination in Chesapeake Bay I had misty eyes.So I'm a soft touch. The views in Fly away Home of Amy's geese as they move in to join the hundreds of wild geese powering South capture this majesty. This story of a group of people who care about and assist this natural pattern may help reinforce some of the awe that we should all feel when confronted with these epic and annual journeys. at adults. The supporting cast also flesh out their strong characters to make the whole film much more believable.The cinematography is beautiful, the dusky-autumnal scenes are captured in an explosion of reds and yellows and oranges that seem to wash over you time and time again, and the final flight sequence is a wonderful closing to an incredibly refreshing film. 	6.8	0
Bliss (1997)	"the players and the images and content stayed with me for weeks afterwards. It is not for the prudish but if you are in the mood for a powerful film about human sexuality, marriage, and how the dance between the partners can and should be, this is a movie for you. Watch it with someone that you care deeply about. Terence Stamp makes it all work. Both Sheffer and Lee do excellent jobs as well. in emotionally. There aren't too many movies that focus on the relationship within marriage, and give powerful hope for the unimaginable possibilities within it. Bliss definitely does this. It's very real, and I thought the acting was excellent. Perhaps I'm easily moved, but I found myself sitting close to the screen, fully emotionally locked into the script. My grade? A- audacious performances in this unique love story.  The music is amazing.  It works so well in the film, and it hightens the mood of the movie very well.  Not everyone will like it.  A film about adult sexuality, where sex isn't portrayed in a cartoonish ""teenage"" way, is a daring idea.  But it works beautifully. husband like Joseph places on his partner and marriage. The more it is viewed, the better and educational it gets, rather than having to read and view many volumes of text and videos on the subject of Tantric lovemaking, a subject that has it's poo-hoo critics.I will be waiting eagerly for Lance Young's sequel to this excellent movie, if any.

Grace of My Heart (1996)	"is very good & has that 60's, 70's feel to it. I just wish the soundtrack album had included the tunes ""Hey There"" & ""Grace Of My Heart"" by Kristen Vigard who did the vocals for Illeana Douglas. If you like nostalgic movies about pop music like ""The Idolmaker"", ""Grease"", ""That Thing You Do"" & ""Hairspray"" you'll like this too. the songs. I thought the movie lost something when it moved west to California but was deeply moved by Douglas and Turturro 'having it out' at the empty poolside. The final song with the flashbacks and her crowning achievement of recording that ""one great album"" had me weeping again. I really like this movie so I ordered the DVD online. original music is great, too. The film moves seamlessly from the fifties through the seventies due in part to the talent of the actors, but also due to the impressive costume and makeup work and the wonderful original music written for each period. Y'know how people often say of good movies, ""You'll laugh/You'll cry""? Well this is one of those. that hinder your enjoyment of the film?  Give me a break.If you don't like a film, at least do us all the favor of giving good reasons and at least ATTEMPT to make intelligent comments rather than the half-baked crap we see here.This film was excellent.  The soundtrack was amazing, the actors were even more amazing.  10/10 unlike Beach Boy Brian Wilson. Some parts are a bit too dramatic, but the songs in the movie--composed by the Brill writers make up for it. The highlight is Douglas's lip sync(sung by Kristen Vigard), written by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello. Good rock and roll movie.

Brother of Sleep (Schlafes Bruder) (1995)	"However for those who like psychological thrillers andstories about misunderstood and socially inept geniuses, this is amazing. The music and cinematography is fantastic. Plus this film incorporated 3 of my favorite German actors. The way that the sound was utilized is just unbelievable as well.For the intellectuals out there who appreciate art in all things, rent or buy this one. the ""tortured artist"" persona that is Elias - the isolation, the dedication to your craft in spite of other desires which we cannot displace, and the embodiment of the emotional realm that so frequently serves as the origin of our inspiration ... this is what the story is truly about.

The girl is the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge.In my book this is one fine action movie. only one Van Damme film...see Maximum Risk.  It is a decent thriller, not just a martial arts flick.  Unfortunately, after seeing how good Van Damme can be (yes, he can act - something we've yet to see from Stephen Seagal who he's usually compared to) it makes you sad to see how many bad films he's really made. the viewer with excellent action sequences. This is definitely Van Damme's best turn as an actor. Natasha Henstridge does a rather decent turn as the damsel in distress, and creates good chemistry between herself and Van Damme. I don't see why this was a huge flop in theaters; it's surely Van Damme's best and at heart an exciting action flick. 	5.5	0
Michael Collins (1996)	"Liam Neeson is big enough to tie it all together. It would also be nice for him to have a constant foil. Whether or not he deserves it historically, the movie seems to make De Valera Collins' foil. It would be great to fully embrace the conflict and give De Valera more screen time. Make this Collins versus De Valera. all, Michael Collin's tactics were not pretty, everything from car-bombings to mob-style executions. Yet we still care for him, we want him to succeed, even if he himself isn't sure he wants to.Without it's politics, this movie is still excellent. It's a great piece of movie-making, it's involving, sad, funny and sometimes tense. One of the movies I consider classic. pull off the Irish thing too well. However, given his character, Eamon de Valera, it isn't really a miscast, just takes time to get in.If you can ignore how horrible Julia Roberts is and think about the heart and emotion behind this film while enjoying the awesome score you're in for a treat.

I wish I had a howitzer like that. was in it to boost box office ratings - although I would have hardly thought that necessary with Neeson and Rickman as the main characters.

Rich Man's Wife, The (1996)	gushing, but I have worked a lot of movies with a lot of actors, and she really did stand out.  All in all, I don't think you can lose by spending a little time with this movie, but I have to warn you:  There are more plot holes in it than there are pot holes in Jersey City. some stupidity, and the jump scenes in it are predictable. Plus the film itself is predictable, but it is good, and it worth watching. Halle Berry is sensational as The Rich Man's Wife. The ending is especially satisfying, making your jaw drop to the ground. I give it a 7 out of 10. Rated R for strong violence and language. Greene(Cole Wilson)? This film was predictable in many parts and the lighting was really bad.However,Halle Berry was very pretty in this movie and yes she actually does cry.Just dont make the same mistake I did and stay up til' 3 o'clock in the morning.But what the heck I was bored.To wrap this comment up I give it a 6/10 * hitting a moving target with a handgun is not as easy as it looks in most Hollywood products.The camera loves Halle Berry and here she displays some acting chops that would prove that she was not just another (very) pretty girl. So this is an average to slightly above average Neo-Noir that can be enjoyed for the best of it. Very good cast, direction, acting, sets and if you live in Australia and you see a copy of this movie, get it straight away because it is extremely rare since it is only on video now and they have stopped all production of videos.

I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything.I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama.Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film. milestone.Might I add that I have always felt that Matthew Broderick is a fantastic actor, especially in roles that require an average looking, quiet introspective character. He is perfect for this cinematic vehicle, and equal to the talents of a Tom Hanks any day. I was also impressed that he produced, directed and shared writing credits on this film project. initiate the challenge, whereas in real life, it was the hapless abacus salesman who challenged him, completely unaware that he was taking on a renowned physicist. Therefore, the sense of irony, and of Feinman's idiosyncrasy in the world of mere mortals, is lost.

Big Night (1996)	the preparation and serving of food presented so beautifully and lovingly in a movie. The final, wordless scene, in which a simple omelette is prepared and the brothers express their reconciliation, is, for me, one of the most eloquently poetic codas I have ever seen. This is a warm-hearted movie with a great deal of humor that rates an A+. common ground, for further evaluation and perhaps some adjustments. The movie, quite appropriately, doesn't reveal the direction that our immigrants will take. However, it beautifully displays the quiet coexistence of three personalities in a more persuasive journey!I wonder if `the Big Night' is an adaptation of Freudian Psychoanalysis. If so could you identify `Id', ` Ego' and  `superego'? SR Because, at its heart, this is a character-driven piece -- about the love and mutual respect shared by two strong-willed siblings.  Someday I will take part in a feast like that shared by the characters in this film, and on that day, I will be an extraordinarily happy man.  Until then, I'll watch this movie again and again. hopes and dreams and struggles -- some within reach, some not. It's got a good cast too. They all make it look easy, but they have a charming script and careful direction. I think Billy Wilder would have approved. At turns funny and touching, and the last scene -- several minutes without a word of dialogue -- is pure gold. most beautiful and poignant ending I could ever hope to see.

I could do worse. brunette has a completely pointless scene where she is topless in front of the mirror is a bonus. :) The camera work is stylish and the discordant guitar riffage of Mr.Ry Cooder is superb, the pace is slow but not sluggish and you can almost feel the heat and dust. This film is good but not great. Er... that's it. a brothel, for example, is classic Hill stuff in terms of its staging, unapologetic brutality and superb cutting.That the film is a remake of a remake is of no consequence to me. It is still a rousing, spare piece of masculine entertainment with a whiff of Peckinpah, a dash of Kurosawa, and a splatter of Corbucci.That ain't no bad thing. talky segments, it feels painfully stiff. The acting style is flat, and everybody delivers their lines with the same sour expression, which Hill seems quite fond of considering how many facial close ups he uses.In the end, the movie has a little something to offer.

Worth renting from Blockbuster. of the girls and what they've been through and what they go through shows how unfortunate they were and even worse, I damn near almost started crying at the ending 'cause it made me feel so bad.  Christopher Young score well with the BGM of this flick to put the cherry on top.very wonderful movie with a conscience 10/10 like to empathize with a movie. If you let yourself have the same feelings as the characters in themovie have you might have strong emotions like: despair, feelingtrapped and injustice. You might even find, that choices you can't comprehend are suddenlyvery logical. For peoples that don't let their feelings participate in watching themovie. I imagine this movie is less appealing. 	6.9	0
2 Days in the Valley (1996)	and picturesque.  I know I'm using a lot of superlatives to describe this movie, but it's so darn good and so few people went to see it and I hope more people do.  So I urge anyone who hasn't to check out this underrated gem!  You won't be disappointed!  My score:  8 (out of 10) true ensemble cast, with no one -- with the possible exception of Spader, having a lead role. The story is full of twists, surprises and turnabouts enough to flesh out two or three movies. You can tell that all of these fine actors are enjoying playing the quirky characters we are presented with to make this a true fun romp. that decides its time to shoot a foursome at the golf course next to his home.  How these characters are brought together through the planning of an Olympic star (well, almost a star)who is ready to have her ex knocked off for the will is amusing, well acted, and one of the best films I've seen in some time. Two Days in the Valley and never once thought about PF, because I enjoyed it and accepted it as just another variation on a theme that was worth watching....and I'll more than likely watch it again....for its entertainment value.  The characters were believable in a many-threaded plot that finally knitted together in a way that did not seem contrived. is an aging hit man and provider of comic relief. Jeff Daniels is a burnt out detective and Eric Stoltz is a detective wannabe.Rounding out the cast is Paul Mazursky, Peter Horton, Marsha Mason, and small parts for Keith Carradine and Louise Fletcher. You will probably want to invite friends over and watch this thing again. It is worth it. 	6.5	0
Curdled (1996)	"comedies, like Parents and I, Madman. Jones (her solo dance is a knockout) and Baldwin are both dead-on, and the director and editor never miss a beat. This is one of the best films of the 90s. (by the way, did anyone notice that this film opened about the same time as Headless Body in Topless Bar? quite a coincidence.) Robert Rodriguez. Apparently this exists in the same universe that ""From Dusk to Dawn"" does, plus features Billy Baldwin as a killer. That is pretty sweet.I would need to see this a second time to really get a handle on it, but I think I was pleasantly surprised and hope this film somehow makes a resurgence on people's to-see lists. of extras (including the original short film) for a movie that is apparently so reviled. The worst thing I can say about ""Curdled"" is that Braddock didn't go on to make another film and Jones went on to do a freakin ""Children of the Corn"" sequel. Recommend to all fans of serial killer movies and dark comedies. My rating: 10/10 William Baldwin plays the killer.  Angela Jones' character is mesmerized by murder scenes and gets a job with a company that cleans up after murders.  She soon comes in contact with the murderer on the job site and the suspense begins to build.  Great performance by Angela Jones and a brilliant story and dialogue provided by Braddock. the casual way that the gore is treated, it may not be suitable for everyone.  However, I enjoyed it b\c of it's pure creativity and of course, wonderful acting by the two main leads. A give it a strong 8/10 stars for having the courage to be different.  That is my story and I am sticking to it. "	5.9	0
Ed's Next Move (1996)	"the folk music scene. While the script could have been sharper the film more than makes up for it with the subtle but sensual sexuality of Callie Thorne, the at times stunning photography of Peter Nelson, and the really quite amazing soundtrack. Anyone looking for a film with heart will not go wrong giving this little known gem a view. Next Move does a wonderful job showing us a realistic beginning of a new relationship, and that makes this story so enjoyable and satisfying.  This movie understands the hoops any nice guy has to go through, and is a wonderful cathartic experience for anyone who has attempted to ask a girl out and retreated before even asking the question. and has a nice naive quality.  The lead actress, who looks like Annabelle Sciorra's (sp?) relative, is also very likable and has a  nice chemistry with Ross.  I was very surprised at how enjoyable this film was.  There is not a whole lot to the film, but it is very emotionally rewarding and worth checking out. for a young man moving to a big city. The awkwardness for a regular guy in finding that special someone, asking her out, and then the dating. It's hard not to like Ed. I also enjoyed the folksy music by ""Ed's redeeming quality band"". I especially enjoyed the song ""more bad times"". This movie was fun and I liked it. and spends most of the film's run time trying to get together with her. ""ENM"" is a modest but likeable little romantic comedy sans titillators about the usual Manhattan ""flat rats"" with more practical dating single issues in lieu of romance. Even tempered but only slightly original, ""ENM"" makes for an easy going, pleasant watch for romcom junkies only. (C+) "	6.4	0
Extreme Measures (1996)	"Awfully Big Adventure will be well aware of this.  And Gene Hackman is as excellent as ever.  A word for Elizabeth Hurley, who produced the film, and I think it was her first: a damn good job she did, despite some unsavoury sniping in the British press about her.  I'd give it an 8 out of 10 a job Hugh Grant would do in a role much more serious than we usually see, but...surprise!  He is thoroughly convincing as a young surgeon troubled by some things that don't add up in the Emergency Room, troubled enough to investigate further, risking his career and ultimately his life to find out what is going on.Definitely worth a look! as was the entire cast. the movie, where I could not decide whether ""the bad guy"" really was such a bad guy. I think that this sounds very confusing, but watch the movie and decide for yourself. ""The bad guy's"" motives aren't bad at all, it is just the way he does it! A thrilling, although a bit slow movie at times. I voted 7/10. Hugh Grant is very convincing and unaffected in one of his most serious roles, and the ending is not as cut-and-dried as you might expect it to be. But the most memorable moment, for me at least, occurs early on, when a very ill and frightened man, barely able to speak, looks straight into Grant's eyes, pleading for help. (**1/2) "	6.1	0
Glimmer Man, The (1996)	"Asian holy man role, that for peace and harmony likes to beat the living crap out of bad guys. For a partner there is the wise cracking Keenen Wayans who perfectly compliments Seagal. And there are plenty of smaller role bad guys that meet their demise.

One would figure if you were going to pair him up with someone, make it another action hero or another martial artist.Either way, if you're a Segal, action movie fan this movie is a good way to kill a couple of hours.  If you're not into that, then skip this flick. career and is sorely missed in his latest films.  An action vehicle that played perfectly to his talents and probably the last of the finest when it comes to the Seagal collection with the exception of ""Exit Wounds"".  Although unappreciated at the box office, this is what made Seagal ""Seagal"" and belongs in any Seagal fans DVD collection. are good,and as brutal as usual for a Seagal flick.you won't really find much new here,but if you're a Seagal fan,or a fan of the genre,this should keep you satisfied for the most part.by now,with Steven Seagal,you know what you're getting,or at least you should know.i was entertained for around 90 minutes or so.for me,The Glimmer Man is a 7/10 Man is not a masterpiece by any means but it serves its purpose well as a tense action thriller. It tries hard to be more than it is, but its lack of originality is its biggest flaw but it gets top marks for trying. You can't take anything away with you afterwards, but you can enjoy yourself along the way. "	5.4	0
D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996)	could teach children and teenagers about life. The third installment of this series, directed more toward teenagers than anyone else, really shows how teamwork and positive thinking can overcome obstacles and help them grow. I have seen D3 many times and yet as I recently bought the DVD and watched it again, I couldn't help but cheer for the Ducks. from again. Oh well.In this film, it's almost a rehash of the first film. A team who cannot get it together, get a washed up hockey player who they hate to coach them and they love him...your basic family fun, Disney flick.All in all this was a great movie, but hopefully Disney realizes that we've had enough.*** out of **** wasn't as bad as everyone says. Like I said, it had a good plot and a little bit of everything. Drama, humor, action, romance. It was great. Covers all the fields that any person can appreciate! All I'm saying is that you shouldn't judge a movie based on it's prequels. Give this movie a try, believe me. It's pretty great. Orion was annoying too. Bad mistake for Bombay to leave. Like I was saying before the movie had a lack of hockey. Throughout the movie you only see them play three games. Here are the positive things to say. The pranks were funny. I especially liked the one with horse turd. Over all I give this movie ** of ****. Peter, and Karp. Although the movie recieves a huge lift when Dean Portman returns to the squad and helps them win the game against the varsity team, it does not have the same feeling of a camaraderie as the first two. This could have been a great movie, if certain changes were made. It is still an enjoyable family movie. 	5.4	0

Faye Dunaway contributes boozy hysterics as Hackman's daughter who has made the jump from ""poor white trash"" to southern belle. Not a great movie. But watch it for Hackman and you'll see screen acting at its best. me as long as the end result on film is good. This was a good movie, and I appreciated the fact that while Cayhall's character was softened over the course of it, there was no real redemption for the character. He played his part in the children's deaths, and he paid the price for it. Overall, this is pretty good. us to see the quiet determination with which he works. (The camera is a good replacement for the interior monologue of fiction!)I also liked the flash-backs which help him to comprehend just where his father came from and why suicide might have been a response. This film is timely today in lieu of the polarization of American politics. Scary stuff! screen. Building up a romance between blue-eyed Mr. O'Donnell and brown-skinned Lela Rochon (as Nora Stark) seems like such an obvious way to improve the story (whether or not it was done in the John Grisham novel), you've got to wonder how on Earth they missed the obvious.***** The Chamber (10/11/96) James Foley ~ Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman, Faye Dunaway "	6.0	0

But in point of fact Knotts is just a bad planner.The Apple Dumpling Gang spawned a sequel in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again where Knotts and Conway have even more hysterical misadventures.

Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955)	"Ebsen who captured my imagination and have kept me dreamin' for nearly half a century.  Sure there were some Hollywood inaccuracies but the flavor, feeling and freedom of the eastern woodlands and the early frontiersmen were portrayed good enough to make me, and a lot of others, life-long Crockett admirers.  ""Be sure you are right then go ahead."" as a Congressman from Tennessee comprises the middle part which sets up the third and exciting finale as Crockett and friends battle the Mexican army in the famous battle at the Alamo. The Appalachians of North Carolina where the Creek War skirmishes were filmed show beautiful mountain vistas and add realism to this fine film story of an American legend. childish, and a mediocre production at best.Perhaps that's all true, but it would miss the most important point. Seldom has any TV production cause so many young people to love a couple of screen characters so deeply, and with such spontaneous joy. In this regard it is a Classic and holds a special place in the history of television art. moments away was the best way they could have done it. The movie even had some historic truths which other movies about the Alamo lacked such as the attack before dawn. It seemed longer when I was a kid and I know they have cut some; yea even important scenes, which I wish they would restore to DVD or VHS. a 3 week period in 1956 and have seen it so often I can almost recite the dialogue.  Fess Parker has been and always will be Davy Crockett, and even though George Russell was a ficticious character, he also did a super job.

Why not Tony & Tia?I could rhapsodize for paragraphs about both ""With Mountain"" films, and I may still do so when I get my special edition DVDs. In the meantime, here's hoping that a whole new generation of kids will discover ""Witch Mountain"" for themselves.  I can now share some of my childhood with my own kids.  No big surprise, but my older daughter (7) loves it.  My younger daughter (2) thought some parts were ""scary daddy""; the broom/jail scene was well done! Highly recommend it as a family film for folks that want a nice movie to watch with their kids. 5th grader, I knew what it was to be outside the norm, and I wanted to have the same powers that Tia did, so I guess that's saying something!I too place this movie with Parent Trap, Candleshoe, and Freaky Friday. Good movies that I don't have to worry about my child ""catching"" wrong words from!  **** out of 5. has the usual hi jinks one expects in a ""chase"" film. I enjoyed it then and liked it just as much after a recent viewing on cable.This movie also illustrates how one doesn't need bad language or crude behavior/jokes to appeal to kids.

Herbie Rides Again (1974)	"spunky. Keenan Wynn is almost perfect in his role as the over-the-top Disney villain. OK - the flashbacks to Herbie's racing career are too long. But the film is strong enough to succeed despite that setback. This film is classic early Disney - full of impossible fantasy and magical inventions. If you have children - this film is a must. is in charge the whole time and has maybe lost a touch of the `lovable little guy' appeal that he had in The Love Bug.Overall kids will love it, and it isn't a bad Herbie movie  it's just not as good as the first couple.  But really  you know what to expect and it delivers nothing more. it was made in the mid sixties. I guess it was Stephanie Powers's character's sense of style and the heavy use of sets and rear projection.The Volkswagon beatle has always had a persona to it and the Herbie movies highlight it.""The Love Bug"" and ""Herbie Rides Again"" are great examples of the child like spirit of Disney at their best. made me pay attention when I was a little whipper-snapper!Disney should have stopped this series at this point.  The next film, ""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo,"" was pedestrian, and only saving grace was that it, A) features Don Knotts, and B) is 1,000 times better than ""Herbie Goes Bananas,"" the only good thing about which is the whacky title.   The funniest part in the movie was when Herbie and all of his volkswagen friends chased Alonso Hawke down the streets of San Francisco.  That part is hilarious and priceless. Children and adults will love this movie and the other Herbie movies too. Go out and buy all of the Herbie movies.  You won't regret it. "	5.6	0
Old Yeller (1957)	"does not know the story of ""Old Yeller"", be warned that you may shed tears after seeing what many consider to be one of the most heartbreaking scenes in movie history. But that scene only makes you love this movie even more as through tragedy comes hope and learning experiences. Don't miss one of the greatest classics of all time. taking responsibility, not sneaking drinks and experimenting with sex.  Also, the ""messages"" were woven nicely into the script, not tacked on and rammed over your head.  It also helped that they had actors, rather than ""stars"".  This is really what family filmmaking (a term I generally hate) should be:  Something that kids and adults can appreciate.  Superb performances all around, a very touching (especially for dog lovers, it might even be to painful for some i.e. my wife) with a very heart-wrenching ending. They don't make them like this any more. If you enjoyed Old Yeller, may I recommend you give The Yearling a try.  Which is even better (if possible) than Old Yeller. lazy settler who doesn't do a thing. Even Chuck Connors has a fine cameo as the real owner of Old Yeller who gives the dog up to please a child.Old Yeller still has the power to make me cry, and I've seen it at least 50 times. It's sentimental and pushes all the right buttons, but I still love it. Travis character toward the little girl. I don't remember even noticing that as a child.

A truly good family film, much better than the book, and one really worth viewing. it is set in the early 1900's, its message is still very applicable in the modern world.I was blown away by the genuine power of Hayley Mill's performance.The supporting cast is also excellent,especially Karl Malden and Agnes Moorehead.If you want to see a nearly flawless and absolutely charming fim,than this is the one to see.Far and away Hayley's best performance. is a positive attribute, not an indictment. Cheezy? How about ""touching"" instead? The cast, the performances, the setting, and most of all, the message are right on. The film makes me laugh and cry every time I view it. How could you possibly ask for more? Guess I'm just a soft touch. Highly recommended for all but the terminally cynical. way of life.  I come from a school of thought where sunny is ridiculed and message movies are tedious, so the lead is an obvious target of disdain. Stay with Pollyanna awhile and watch her reform all the bitter, crusty malcontents on the planet into fans with a straightforward logic and uncanny point of view.  A true heroine. wonderful job in recreating that era before World War I in small town America, very much like The Music Man. Pollyanna is what they mean by fine family entertainment, as good now as it was when I first saw it in theaters in 1960.In fact it might just make one curious enough to check out the Mary Pickford silent version.

Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)	of trouble, they set out on their adventure home.Along the way they encounter many unexpected surprises but their determination and love for their owners helps them in finding their way. For me, this was an unforgettable story of love, courage and devotion that will inspire everyone who watches it. A must see for animal lovers! I give it a 10! straight as the mature Golden Retriever.The only somewhat-bothersome character is the 13-year-old boy who is impatient and pouty at times, but he gets out that after awhile.The scenery is nice, too, with photographers doing a fine job capturing the beauty of California's Sierra mountain range. All in all, a very nice movie and highly-recommended for one of those 'family nights.' both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever.  This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults.  Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry!  (happy tears!) personalities: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) He's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one. sap! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case.

Swiss Family Robinson (1960)	alone the face-off scene with the hyenas!  Wrestling an anaconda chest-deep in a mosquito and leech-infested swamp is probably not a role most actors dream of.  James MacArthur was told by the snake's handler to just dunk the snake's head under water when it started to constrict him; apparently it worked, as he lived to tell the tale! To me this film is an exception to the less-weighty fare that Disney was wont to produce over the years.  I like Disney flicks, but this is one I can go back and watch when I want to get lost in an idyllic setting (with beautiful soundtrack music to establish the mood).  You've gotta love those coconut bombs! This is a timeless classic, watch it a couple of times a year and it is just as entertaining the second time as the first. Wish Disney would re-release this film to theatres so you could see it on a big wide screen, preferably Imax. Movies just do not get any better than this one. Perfect film for family viewing. DVD.  It's great! The extras are wonderful and the movie is even better.  I love Disney movies, but some of the older live-action movies get annoying to me after awhile.  This one doesn't.  I love to imagine myself on that island with all the animals and fighting pirates.  It's great.  I definitely recommend it! Kirk and JAMES MacARTHUR, who excels as the oldest son.There's some rough going when the pirates invade, but it's all done in true Disney style and you know there's going to be a happy ending.Summing up: The kind of film the whole family can enjoy. A lot more visually appealing than the old B&W version filmed on RKO sound stages. 	7.2	0
That Darn Cat! (1965)	just enough menace to make the kidnapped woman's predicament a little scary. I also loved the wacky next-door neighbors (Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest), Hayley's surfer-boyfriend named Canoe (Tom Lowell), and befuddled Ed Wynn as a jewelry salesman. Simply put, a wonderful modern-day caper for parents and kids which puts the remake with Christina Ricci to shame. ***1/2 from **** film, anyhow?  Fantastic acting?  Great plot? Beautiful cinematography?  Superb directing?  Babes?  Well, you can't say it had any of those things.  But it DID set out to do what it attempted to do, which was:  make people laugh.  A lot. And that makes it, in my opinion, a pretty darn good movie. the mix of comedy and real malice towards their captive. The cat was a funny part, i remember them trying to 'paw print' him and them winding up plastering poor Dean Jones head to foot w/ the cat's inky paw prints.Say what you will, Disney doesn't make things like this anymore and that is our loss.*** outta **** it's fun. The Riddler(Batman), to Roddy McDowell, to Uncle Charlie(My Three Sons). And of course, Dean Jones and Haley Mills. It's one of those timeless, goofy Disney comedy classics that stands in a kitsch class of it's own! Ya gotta see it again!YMMV if you're a tweener at this point (too mature for it's cornball silliness, and too young to be nostalgic!)  I also like the actress who plays the hostage - she *looks* like an older woman who might actually work at a bank - not like a Hollywood glamour girl! I haven't seen the 1997(?) remake, but I suspect it isn't as good as the original.  All in all, an enjoyable movie for a Saturday night at home! 	6.7	0

Mr Goff died March 3, 1993 at his home in Palm Springs at the age of 81.Corfman probably true if you study his character of Ned Land. But in parallel, Douglas makes his character funny and likeable. Then, Paul Lukas and especially Peter Lorre are outstanding.No matter that the movie was launched in 1954, the special effects aren't antiquated. Thanks to them, the movie could keep a certain charm and nowadays, it lets itself watch with pleasure. the United States Navy launched it's first atomic submarine.

Nonetheless, Verne's speculations on power do make a good symbolic match with the notion of atomic energy, birthing a very credible meditation on the nineteenth century in the light of its successor. The somber and frighteningly beautiful finale causes us to wonder just at what point before 1900 this or that fateful corner was turned. most interesting and visually spectacular films ever made, whereas the book contained a great deal of unfilmable ichthyology that was more of an excursus into the expertise of Jules Verne than any dramatic device.

Cool Runnings (1993)	general silliness, but there is also good drama and fine performances.  John Candy showed he could deliver an emotional performance instead of just schtick.

The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks. uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you. When things seem impossible, just remember that there's a Jamaican bobsled team. are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that's worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichés are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film, and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm. take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair, get the phone on divert, and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching. 	6.9	0
Angels in the Outfield (1994)	George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins believing in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and Roger and J.P. find something to believe in. Glover in particular gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing a washed-up pitcher, also does well, despite clearly having ZERO idea of how to pitch out of the windup! the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay. to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world.As a young adult the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive, however I will give credit to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover who all did a fantastic job. the characters even though we know exactly what's going to happen to them.To be sure, there are many better films out there, and adults would almost certainly want to spend their time watching one with a bit more maturity. But for those looking for a movie they can enjoy along with their children, they will find Angels worth their time. also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time. It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best. A must see. I highly recommend.8/10 	6.1	0
Cinderella (1950)	"hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a ""Dream Come True."" work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal. scenes include the ""Nightingale"" number, with Cinderella's reflection in the soap bubbles, the evil sisters tearing her dress to shreds, her arrival at the ball, and the trying-on of the slipper. Add to that some great numbers like ""Bibbodi Bobbodi Boo"", and the mice's ""work song"". A wonderful movie, that never loses its magic, no matter how old you are. interest.  The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers.  It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them.  Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century. sequence of the fairy godmother is one of the best of all Disney films (what a dream the transformation of the dress) and the ball episode is exciting and fascinating in both drawing (note the use of the shadows at a time when computer coloring was far away), dialogue and music (the Cinderella Waltz ""So this is love"" is enchanting).

Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968)	sequence in Dumbo; inspired, creative and unforgettable. During the storm, pages from the book blow away as the wind rises, rain washes text down the page and away into a stream, etc. Everyone should love this adaptation; Disney soon cranked Pooh out as a series, and it got tedious and sloppy.  But this early effort is a real masterpiece. as a whole (a couple of images from it stayed with me through the years), and that gives it the edge to appeal to older audiences.  While I would usually recommend The Many Adventures, if one just wants to see part of the film, this is the one to see.  A+ (as much for quality as for nostalgia) for Animated Short and it's easy to see why: everything clicks.  The voice casting is great, the design is superb, animation is top-notch and the source material is accorded with the respect and affection it merits. By all means, find this and watch it if you can.  As of this writing, it is in-print.  Most joyously recommended. film and it made me sing along and laugh.If you like Winnie The Pooh I would recommend this one! because it's full of fun adventures for the whole family to enjoy. It may be an older movie but it is a great one! Actually I prefer the older Winnie The Pooh movies,but I like all the Winnie The Pooh movies! score is also memorable, too. What didn't satisfy me was that it didn't include the Winnie the Pooh theme song. Does anyone know why? Anyway, in conclusion, Walt Disney died during the production of this short and the Academy Award was given posthumous. So see it for him if you haven't already, because I'm very sure he would've liked it. 	8.0	1
Sword in the Stone, The (1963)	"Era, when ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"" or especially ""Bambi"" set the utmost high standards of perfectionism, but quite better than in ""Hercules"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Rescuers down under"". 7 of 10 stars for ""The Sword in the Stone""! It is not the best of all Disney films, but quite better and deeper than the most of the modern CGI movies! of T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King. Made for the kids, Disney does it again taking a classic story and adding fictional animal characters that can talk. Still, Disney remains loyal to the story by keeping many of the characters in the story including Kay, Sr. Pellinoire, and Sir Ector.Worth watching twice with the family. An animated classic take forever because there are so many hilarious moments.The songs are clever and enjoyable, such as ""The Sword in the Stone"", ""That's what makes the world go round"" and especially ""Higitus Figitus"", my personal favorite.I like this movie and I've gotta say that humor is, without a doubt, the strongest attribute of this movie.This should definitely be on Top 250. agreed that the later novel has disfigured the first, so that we may be thankful for the Disney version!Though it does not quite follow the book (this is hardly possible, at times) it is a very good version as animated movies go. Not tedious, though of an age where children were meant to learn something from a movie...A collectors item! (one may try to look to the Jungle Book or Winnie the Pooh for that, or the underrated Aristocats), however I sometimes come back to this film in my mind. It has a catchy attitude that made being in the 'dark ages' as fun as possible- Archamedes in particular is maybe one of the great side-characters in any Disney film.Alakazam! "	7.2	0
So Dear to My Heart (1949)	"the theater will love the feeling of being taken back to a time when simple things were the important things in life. I hope you enjoy it as much as our family.Like Song of the South, it is not currently out on DVD in the United States, but fortunately I bought a laser-disc copy of the film several years ago. in real life, then I'd probably meet and work with them. This movie is not as well-known as other Disney films, probably because of its simple story, but don't miss it. With a lot of pros I've mentioned above, it doesn't seem dated. I love it as much as ""Song of the South"" and rate it **** out of ****. of ""Song of the South"" doesn't completely succeed because, although the same kids--Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten--are present, there's no Uncle Remus or any memorable songs beyond ""Lavender Blue"" (which, granted, is a dilly). Still, the film is meticulously produced and overwhelmingly heartfelt. A nice addition to the Disney catalogue, and rather touching in its old-fashioned way. *** from **** uncle. The animation is quite good, but the live action takes up most of the screen time. There are some memorable songs, although the Oscar nominated tune ""Lavender Blue"" is actually rather disappointing. So Dear To My Heart is worth watching, just so long as you remember that it was made in a time when the world was more innocent. bring back memories! Quite honestly, I'm surprised the ""offend no-one"" attitude of Disney today hasn't got to the religious content of this film, which is refreshing and makes me thankful that they at least hold SOME things sacred (unlike digitally removing Pecos Bill's cigarette or editing out the Hatfields and McCoys scene from Make Mine Music). I love this film. "	7.1	0
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)	started playing the part of Hollywood bean-counter and worrying about 'Waterworld's' budget. But you know what I like about both these movies? No CGI. I am sick and tired of CGI movies. Popping the deluxe 'Robin Hood' DVD into the old player is a refreshing treat and a thumb in the eye of digital junk like 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' well have got an English actor instead of an American one, but somehow, I don't think Costner could have been bettered. He makes an excellent Robin Hood. Alan Rickman is brilliant as the hilarious Sherrif of Nottingham ('Shut up you TWIT!')It's great fun, and one of those film to watch with your feet up and a big bar of chocolate..... Mastrantonio give their all, creating a truly emotional and powerful film.  I don't understand why the ratings are so low.The ending is just beautiful.  I boo at the sheriff, cheer for Robin, and cry during Robin and Marian's post-sword fight embrace every time, and you will too if you ignore the cynics and give this adventure a chance.9/10 Absolutely love it!!! Could watch it again and again great action sequences including the battle against the hired Celts and Nottingham's soldiers and the final confrontation at the climax of the film.Finally, don't be put off by Costner's lack of an English dialect.  It doesn't hurt the film at all, and is just something critics were instantly attracted to, as it is their job to find faults.Highly recommended. 	6.9	0
Mary Poppins (1964)	"but they can register the message here of what is truly important in life. Poppins has the answers. It is better we don't analyze who she is  and or course she never explains anything. The Banks family is just glad she was there for a while, and we should be glad that Walt Disney left us with this masterpiece. are a few drawbacks: The film's a little over-long, especially in the final third where Mary's but an afterthought in all the plot resolution. In addition, Van Dyke was an excellent choice for his singing and dancing (and popularity), but his cockney accent does grate after a while.But all in all, this is a tour de force for all involved! won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.With songs both silly and sublime, seamless intermeshing of live performers and animation as only the Disney studio, at that time, was capable of, and the undeniable magnetism of Andrews and Van Dyke, it is nearly impossible NOT to like ""Mary Poppins""! so I could get the Mary Poppins prize inside, to gathering on weekends with cousins to listen to the soundtrack and try to dance like Bert. I've been to London many times since then, but funny enough, as much as the great city has to offer, I've never been able to find that magical place I saw 40 years ago. those gorgeous songs(each one of them great). The animation part is brilliant, takes a genius to make that and coordinate those dancing penguins with the Bert character.And I think that all the words that I could possibly say about this film are over, except tat this film is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Mary Poppins, practically perfectly in every way! A MUST SEE FILM!! "	7.8	1
Dumbo (1941)	"(the train song), Pink Elephants, When I see an elephant fly and Baby Mine.10/10. Timothy Q Mouse is a great character, the animation is so concise and perfect, great songs, the message that if you believe you can overcome your handicaps you will so inspiring and beautiful, and the movie so short and sweet it will forever retain its appeal. that it is an attempt to revise that stereotype into something positive and sympathetic.  The songs and score are flawless, and the show-stopping, nightmarish pink elephant sequence keeps things from getting too artistically conservative--and, just like the rest of the film, it still thrills us no matter how many times we have seen it.  10 out of 10. can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful ""Baby Mine"" . The pink elephants scene is a classic. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best on a scale of one to ten...10  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve. Edwards, ""Ukelele Ike"" and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black --- I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it's a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time. It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability. "	7.3	0
Pete's Dragon (1977)	special effects are utterly dreadful. Kids will find a lot to like in Pete's Dragon as long as they can sit still for over 2 hours, and adults too will find pleasures along the way. It's certainly one of the better live-action offerings to come from the Disney studio at a time when their output was quite indifferent in quality. up being overrated and turn out to be disappointing because we create too much expectations on them, while a not so known and valued movie I may not expect that much from it but turns out to be a pleasant surprise. That only makes me respect and admire these less valued movies even more.This should definitely be on Top 250. the movie, you'll find yourself spontaneously singing the choruses the next day). The dancing is the most difficult to digest, as it is often stiff and pointless. That's okay, though, as the story and the acting more than make up for it. When all is said and done, Pete's Dragon is everything a kids movie should be: educating and entertaining. all just really, really good performances of well written songs.It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome.I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars. , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable. 	6.4	0
Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971)	also great and imaginative.This is certainly an enjoyable film on many counts, and should be remembered just as so many of the other Disney classics. It should also be seen in the recently restored version, which runs over two hours. The story is more fluent in that version, and the songs are intact, for the most part. A great movie. was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.An often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face! and enjoyment to an already delightful movie. The movie is well worth watching, and suitable for any child. Even today's children will find delight in the cartoon/human relations and the spectacular ending sequence were empty suits of armor are brought to life to fight for the good guys. I consider this movie a timeless classic that shouldn't be passed up. hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me. the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time. 	7.1	0
Alice in Wonderland (1951)	"Disney creating an entertaining look at a child's world. I think it is because of the Jungle Book that this is not as popular as some of the Disney Classics but you can't help but smile when you watch the Queen of hearts and the Mad Hatter being their own creative self's in the wonder of this amazingly clever gem novels (and plenty of rumors that he wasn't on any drugs at all), but there are certainly some things in the books and in the movie that could have only been conjured up by the most, um, eccentric of imaginations. We may never know for sure, but at least we have some wonderful entertainment. Read the books to your kids. Beaumont) is lovely and funny, the supporting characters appropriately manic, and the quiet moments gently even out the craziness (as with the Tulgey Wood/""Very Good Advice"" sequence). Disney certainly runs hot (""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"") and cold (""The Sword and the Stone""), but this fantastic journey into nonsense, from a practically-unfilmable book, is endlessly interesting from a visual standpoint. ***1/2 from **** the hippy culture of psychedelia, ALICE enjoyed a welcome theatrical return engagement in the '60s and has become more respected in recent years (an American-made British fantasy popular even in the U.K.) as one of the studio's finest efforts.Ironically, one of its most delightful characters--the doorknob--never appeared in the book but was applauded everywhere as an inspired bit of business. the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well. "	7.4	0
Fox and the Hound, The (1981)	"just lovely. Plus there are some fun jokes, I loved seeing Chief constantly chasing after Tod and then Slade runs over to Tweed's house to scream about the fox but she just kicks his butt and tells him to get off her property. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend you see it if you get the chance.10/10 what it had, a heart of gold, but also for what it lacked, a traditional formula. If you're looking for a story with a difference and a bittersweet flavor, this is the movie for you! It is nice, quiet, yet provocative and emotional. To sum it up, it is good clean fun with a touch of heartache, a true drama! and unlike the vast library of previous Disney inventions, as stated before, it lacks the happy ending. The proverbial feel good formula that is the frame work for all Disney movies. It's because of it's bittersweet delivery and surprising realism, that it's become a lifeline to my childhood that I will carry with me for as long as I live. he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it? love interest, and the villain, this film really touched me, because I wanted to see their friendship go on.  And although it did go on in some form, there is always that feeling of ""he doesn't belong"" being uttered by many of the other characters.  Why?  Well, this film asks children and adults alike, that very question. "	7.3	0
Freeway (1996)	"was hoping for a nicer twist, this film is your answer. I also suggest that if you couldn't get enough of Freeway that you try to get your hands on the very rare Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. See how Bright delicately transforms yet another dark fairy tale (Hansel and Gretel) into a modern masterpiece.Grade: ***** out of ***** good girl roles she seems stuck in now. This movie is funnier than you can possibly imagine, as things keep happening that just blow you away or shock the pants off you and no main character is what they seem to be at first. Definitely unpredictable, this dark comedy is a rare lost gem I was glad to find again. and enforcer of her own brand of justice to a particularly malevolent form of evil visited on by Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) and an uncaring and unbelieving law enforcement system. It's really a small classic and should be viewed without any predjudice of youth crime. It then becomes an eloquent statement for better and more rational treatment of young offenders. new respect for Reese and glad to know she isn't all about fluff movies catering to woman (i.e., ""Sweet Home Alabama""). I hope Reese digs into the grittier side of life again and does another movie of the ""Freeway"" caliber and leave her mantle of ""the next Meg Ryan"" at home!Way to go Reese, this movie is definitely worth owning! Witherspoon attacks her role full force and is just astounding.  Sutherland is equally good as the wolf (Wolveton--get it?) and the supporting cast is full of talented actors (Amanda Plummer, Michael T. Weiss, Dan Hedaya) all doing great.An undiscovered little gem.  But be warned--the violence and language is more than a little extreme.  NOT for the squeamish. "	6.9	0
Sound of Music, The (1965)	"thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you. scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? ""The Sound of Music"" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :) not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life. could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled. ""Singin' In the Rain"" is the only other contender to the title of ""The greatest movie ever made"". Whatever its flaws, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10 all ages. A Happy family film with no sex, violence or bad language. The young actors playing the roles of the von Trapp children are amazing and Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime as Maria, a young Nun who becomes a cheerful governess.This is definately a family movie to be watched together on a Sunday Afternoon!!

Die Hard (1988)	"of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A scene this movie 30 or 40 times already, and I know he's going to do it again the next time.This is a great film, and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point, and more importantly, it's a fun movie to watch, no matter how many times you see it. handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10 the former are good for a few laughs, and the latter is a very minor complaint.Otherwise, ""Die Hard"" is pretty much flawless. Bruce Willis, John McTiernan, Alan Rickman -- their finest hour (maybe you could make a case for Rickman's loftier work, but he's dead solid perfect here). A movie I have seen more than any other but for ""Casablanca."" "	8.2	1
Lawnmower Man, The (1992)	"has problems, it's not very fast paced, but is terribly engaging and Fahey is superb in the lead. The writing isn't great, but is passable, and the computer effects, though far from the center of the story, are excellent.If you haven't seen it yet, or have only seen the normal version, it is well worth the rental, or even purchase. they never dominate the movie. We might say that the movie deals with the dangers of people relying too much on technology, and also the dangers of militarism, but even aside from that, this is a movie worth seeing. Check it out.Oh, and I think that we can all agree that the sequel needs to be avoided at all costs. computer animation weren't the same back then as they are today.  Most older movies have that look when compared to today's special effects.  I always take that into account when watching older movies.  I enjoyed Lawnmower Man then, now and I will the next time I watch it.  I will keep it in my DVD collection. the hopes and dreams of a brilliant scientists, and the manipulation of a militaristic government. You get to see a great example of ""power corrupting"" a human being.I've seen this film a lot, from 15 to 25 years old, and the last scene of the movie never fails to give me shivers.But please, please, please don't watch the sequel. Really. forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clichéd story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way. "	5.4	0
Unhook the Stars (1996)	"even character study which builds enough interest in the Rowlands character to make it not too difficult to overlook her supporting cast who play obvious stereotypes, ""Unhook..."" is a flick with no punchline which plays like a meal with no dessert. The entertainment is in the ride, not the destination. A good slice of mature life flick worth a look. it used to be anymore!The acting was very good,especially Marisa Tomei was great as Monica Warren,the little boy's mom! Also I very much liked Gerard Depardieu as the truck-driver,but then again, he is always funny.

First rate. who makes a difference in Rowland's life -we never know how much. I wish more had been made of the relationship between Rowland and her daughter. It never becomes clear what their problem really is, and nothing is really resolved. Another exit to the airport ending leaving the viewer with many questions unanswered -very annoying, but overall a good film. Cassavettes(the late auteur John's prodigy), who co-wrote the well-written scrip with Helen Cladwell.

Michelle Pfeiffer should have received another Oscar nomination for her fearless portrayal of Rose Cook Lewis, the character modeled after Shakespeare's evil Regan from ""King Lear.""  While all of the performances are solid, they seem somehow timid next to Pfeiffer, who once again proves that she is most definitely not just another pretty face. know better than to put a hopelessly senile person on the witness stand.  The fine cast does pretty well, especially Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer, although as usual Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely adequate as the youngest sister.  Maybe watching this on a stormy Sunday night helped put me in the mood, but I rather enjoyed this one. I loved the way her character slowly changed through the movie and Lange can evoke so much emotion in the viewer with something as small as a hand gesture. Pfieffer is strong as well although the story mainly revolves around Ginny and I don't really see why Pfieffer gets first billing here. I strongly recommend the film, espeically on dvd. Smiley(, screenplay (Laura Jones), and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that, in my younger days, I wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. I didn't focus on this fact until years later.If you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. Maybe you are ready for it. but I think all the performances were outstanding, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity.  Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool.  I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again! "	6.0	0

Surviving Picasso (1996)	use much of his work in the film. I see the film as a well made, excellently acted, but partial (in both senses of the word) portrait of the artist. Its real focus is the women in his life, especially Francoise Gilot, and on the two-way exploitative nature of the relationship between a man of this kind and his mistresses/wives. an oddity; but how can one expect a man like Picasso to behave like a common man, when he was not one? Anthony Hopkins undergoes a complete transformation, and becomes the man Picasso, this only coming as further proof that a great artist can only be understood by another great artist, and the rest of us are just lucky spectators. Anthony Hopkins becomes the man Picasso. Natascha McElhone, Julianne Moore and Susanna Harker tell us the truth. Well paced, finely directed, this movie tells a riveting story. It is very, very good.It is perhaps worthy of note that many of the negative reviews of this movie are written by men. Picasso was not just difficult; he was a Difficult Man. and even did desperate things to show him how much they loved him. Yet, he didn't seem to appreciate any of their efforts.I was totally drawn into this film and think one needs to give it a chance. It's a thinking person's film. The character development is complex, but you begin to have sympathy for the victims of this madman. Las Vegas.  One half of it portrays a happy woman, the other half is tinged with sadness.  I now know the story behind this painting, making it all the more memorable.  Like the first reviewer, I'm not a big fan of Picasso, but knowing what lies behind some of his paintings will add interest in the future. 	6.4	0
Love Is All There Is (1996)	"is astoundingly beautiful as the Juliet character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful--- and, considering her age at the time, even her dialect is pretty good. Recreating this classic tale with feuding Italian families in the catering business in New York results in great fun. See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud. they're just supposed to be dumb teenagers in love. In fact, the real gems of the movie are the parents, particularly Lanie Kazan's role, and the wacky psychich (Joe Bologna's real life wife) because they are just totally wacko people, so it turns out to be a totally wacky comedy. One that I sure enjoyed.I think it's worth a shot. to (over)protect their children. Angelina Jolie gives a totally charming performance, that resonates with one's romantic side (if one has that).  If you like the actress, you have to have this movie. A fun movie without any message other than, that love is all there is. If it was available on DVD I would buy it in a minute! ""Blame It On Rio"") Lainie Kazan was perfect as his wife, and Paul Sorvino is just a GREAT actor.  Didn't realize till later that this must also have been one of Angelina Jolie's first roles.As a participant/guest/victim of many Italian wedding extravaganzas, I loved it.  A New Yawk version of ""Blazing Saddles"".Four out of five stars from me! all. Being brought up in an old-fashioned Italian neighborhood, I was able to identify with so many of the ""grownups"" in my past.If you're really bummed, your checking account balance is in red, the IRS is after you, and your sinus headache is keeping you awake, find this film.

Beautiful Thing (1996)	DVD, so I can put my last VHS tape to rest, but disappointed that there were no cast interviews or extras at the end.

But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.Overall, a light-hearted look at life on a London council Estate with some great performances... one of my favourite films. on both a nostalgic and familiarity level.  This movie gets better with every viewing...and I'd love to see what happened to each of the characters in a sequal.This movie is, without a doubt, very personal to all gay men and women who came out during their youth and a favorite of all of my friends, both gay and straight. so that bad characters do good things and good characters do bad things. Nobody is perfect and nobody is all bad, which makes the film even more realistic. It's similar to the more recent Get Real, but Beautiful Thing is definitely better. This is without a doubt my favorite gay film. Only the British can make a film this good! context (very nicely detailed film-making) keeps those minor gripes minor.There have been so many cynical or clichéd gay dramas released during the last decade or two, especially in the US (gay film from elsewhere in the world often seems so much more fresh and lifelike) - in many ways this film was (and remains) a real breath of fresh air. 	7.6	1
Long Kiss Goodnight, The (1996)	"pieces that one can only see in an action film. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. Thus, there is formula here, but it is the Anti-Formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity pleasantly surprised when I bump into people who feel the same way too. People either love it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it at all.If you like action films this is a film to definitely try. You may not like it, but it certainly worth the effort to find outAnd as always, leave reality at the door. Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""!! rotation every 3 or 4 months. I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back.All you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves! Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him. It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.

Surprising to see that the movie also had actors in it, that would later turn into big well known names such as Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson, in some good roles. Also Om Puri gives a nice performance.A perfectly fun and simple adventurous action movie. This is high quality entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ like a lion himself.Once this film starts, I can guarantee you that you won't be able to take a snack break, bathroom break, or even think about dozing off.

They turned to hunt kill and eat human beings only because their skin or hides weren't as tough and thus easier to penetrate and not cause the Tasvo Lions any terrible pains in doing so. lion attack scenes are not gruesome and the filmmakers did a nice job a having just the right amount of action and lulls. Neither is overdone. This film has never been given much due but I've never shown it to anyone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.This movie scared me so much I stopped hunting lions. It's just not fun anymore. believe it. John Kani also gives a good performance, contained mostly in small moments that are so true they almost hurt. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the of the lion attacks and their passages through the grass. Again, no cgi effects could convey so much beauty and lurking menace. This movie is beautiful, intense, and dramatic; I highly recommend it. 	6.8	0
Looking for Richard (1996)	"on the edge of our seats as the film neared its climax. My one complaint? I wish they had then gone on to film their entire version of Richard III to offer as a companion piece. An excellent way to indulge yourself in an exciting, well-performed piece of movie-making, and actually come away having learned a little bit. Highly recommended! Shakespeare, and he instilled that appreciation in me. Unfortunately, everyone isn't as lucky. Boring classes turned them off, and that's all they'll ever experience of Shakespeare. They are missing so much. I hope all the English teachers out there who are less than comfortable with teaching Shakespeare will show this film to their classes to counteract any Shakespeare phobia-inducing incidents. Italian from New York City could play Richard the 3rd. ? Al Pacino is marvellous as he searches the stage and beyond for the true Richard the 3rd. Kevin Spacey, Winonna Ryder, and Alex Baldwin are just some who join him in the journey as he wonders the streets of New York and London for the true love of Shakespeare. Ryder sounded like she was ""speaking Shakespeare.""  I had similar problems with Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in Romeo + Juliet, especially compared to the smooth and natural performances of Pete Postlethwaite and Harold Perrineau.The movie is not for everyone.  But if you enjoy acting, if you enjoy Shakespeare, and/or you simply enjoy Pacino, this is a must-see. The cast pulls the play off with aplomb, and the interviewees make their points without becoming dry, didactic, or condescending.  But it's Pacino's show, and he shows not only his great acting talent, but why he's also a great director.  And again, this invites us into a celebration of art, rather than repels us by being a lesson. "	7.4	0
Trees Lounge (1996)	"brilliance and charm that trees lounge conveys. Tommy's character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy. It's in his anti-heroic attributes ie. selfishness and callousness, that make the film so human and believable. American releases as passionate and warm as Trees Lounge do not come around as often anymore, with only The Station Agent coming close. So enjoy. cast has gone on to do other known films. Carol Kane, Mark Boone Junior Steve Buscemi, Bronson Dudley, Anthony LaPaglia and Steve's brother Michael Buscemi star in this Minnie and Moskowitz type story. Seymour Cassell and Mimi Rogers add their touch of magic to this story as well. A deep story with deep characters, this is a movie worth watching. of the drinkers culture. Every actor in this movie hits just the right note especially Chloe Sevigny, who has never looked more fetching. One of those silly Baldwins even turns in a fine performance. Steve Buscemi wrote and directed this movie and I shall be rather intrested in any subsequent work he does in either field. 10 out of 10. a certain type of people(working-class and barflies) and how they live their lives.  While it may drag at times, there's enough truth and detail to keep you interested.  Buscemi also directs actors well; this is the film which convinced me Chloe Sevigny was for real.  I understand Buscemi is making another film; I look forward to it. mothers"", his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadn't even heard of It and It's been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort.

Proprietor, The (1996)	are the heart of this movie.While there are unnecessary sub-plots, even these diversions give the director, Ismael Merchant, an opportunity to cinematically present Paris at its most lovely.I consider this a very good movie with yet another brilliant and controlled performance by the incomparable Moreau. There are some very interesting character roles including Jean Pierre Aumont. The cinematography is lovely! did what I could to make it celebritous, stood and applauded, and Madame very shyly bowed to us.The film itself is best described as imperfect jewels - romantic, beautiful scenes and decors, and a capable cast. For some reason it doesn't completely come together as it should. I would still like a DVD version, for no other reason than posterity. and they then become friends becomes the universal message of this story. Throw in the reconcilation of a marriage gone bad, and the young couple overcoming their cultural differences, and the story comes full circle. The scenes of racial problems in Frances brought the issue to light. Few Americans see this side of France. I give the movie an eight. obviously trying to serve an American audience.  The French, in particular, have a way with invention that sidesteps stereotyping.  Older people don't appear as saints or fools.  Americans don't appear as total idiots.  Youth isn't always blunt and naive.  And life isn't telegraphed.  So an otherwise boring girl flick turns into something worth watching. too bad that we don't have better support for foreign films in this country, so that they get released here. We are missing out on some great movies and actors. This film is worth seeing. Just don't judge the rest of the movie based on Ms. Young's performance. I hope it comes to DVD in the US some time soon. 	5.6	0
Normal Life (1996)	"Perry's change almost believable - however his final change doesn't totally make sense. That said it's a pretty emotional ride that doesn't let you get bored at any point, is well acted and well scripted. All through the film you can't help but feel sad for Perry as he is henpecked, corrupted and ultimately tormented by Judd's childish alluring Pam. time she becomes a new woman.The characters are well drawn, the car chases quite exciting.  This change of mood spices up their sex lives clearly depicted in a series of bedroom scenes.The final sequences are dramatic and exciting so stay with the film to the end. The old saying that ""Crime does not pay"" is clearly delivered and understood. Pam's wild side.  He goes from cop to bank robber in a first successful, but then futile attempt to make things right, which only seems to excite Pam more.  Eventually their luck runs out, and the inevitable ensues.  The last 15 minutes of this film are the best part with some surprising twists right near the end. few details that are not explained (like what exactly is used to justify Perry's character's firing from his job.) Also, the movie is a bit too long, more noticeably in the first half of the movie - cutting fifteen or so minutes from the movie would have helped. But despite these faults, the movie is still well worth seeking out. C it was fashionable to love the underdog during the depression and feel compassion for them. Ashley Judd, again is a genuinely intelligent and gorgeous actress with an educational b.g. which is astonishing and may have influenced the director/writer to involve her in the astronomy which was a masterful quirky touch.The dialogue rings true and again Perry and her amaze.

Get on the Bus (1996)	"in this film.The dialogue is so flowing and casual in this film despite its topic matter, that you could listen to this film instead of watch it!  I can't recommend this film enough for fans of Spike Lee or fans of great dialogue.  As a Spike Lee worshipper, I rank this film in his top 5.  Potent. so he can show it to his future children; and an open-hearted elderly man who is going to the Million Man March simply because he wants to.""Get on the Bus"" is in my opinion, one of Spike Lee's best films.  Each of the characters are unique in one a way or another.A film that is not to be missed. Million Man March. Although many may not relate to Farrakhan and his beliefs, they will, however, be educated on issues of race, unity, and respect. Regardless of skin color or ethnic background, people can easily relate to the characters on-screen. If anything, Get On The Bus will teach anyone to have a deeper love and appreciation of our fellow man. powerful messages, I did feel a little disappointment - but as I write, instead of me whining for a better ending, my mind has traversed across millions of attitudes and set free many images that had been lodged in my simple mind.This may not sound like a riveting review - but you'll need to watch it - you'll be nourished. firmly believe that Spike Lee captured the central epic struggle within the black community and its overall effect on the American landscape as a whole.  I was happy to see that ALL aspects of the society were equally represented in this film without reinforcing dated stereotypes.  This is clearly Lee's greatest work. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE ONCE. "	6.8	0
Shadow Conspiracy (1997)	"but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of that sort. Stars Charlie Sheen. There's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to drop the microcassette in the Potomac River by accident. If they'd cast Emilio Estevez in the part that never would've happened. chance. Wow, it's that bad. The film could have used a more likable hero than Bobby Bishop, blandly played by Charlie Sheen, who whispers his lines incomprehensibly. The pairing of Linda Hamilton with Sheen doesn't add anything to the movie. Donald Sutherland must have a lot to explain to his friends in how he accepted to appear in this picture. no annoying minute in it. The camera movements are superb. The music score very functional. The acting of the protagonists can't be better. I don't understand why so much comments are negative. Perhaps those people don't like to give positive comments ? Anyway. I only want to give my comment and that's what counts for me. Every review is subjective. Waterston didn't exactly inspire confidence as the President. Linda Hamilton was good as Amanda. This wasn't a great action thriller, but it was good nevertheless. Too violent for my taste (and there was a stern warning on the TV station I watched, even after the movie was cleaned up for TV), but I enjoyed the chases and the occasional comedy. on lazy plotting to move it's action along. The conspiracy is easily uncovered and the killer is easily avoided.  When even Charlie Sheen describes this as ""a piece of s***"" then you know it's not going to be good.  Avoid this - an alternative is Enemy of the State which has similar themes but is much, much better. "	4.9	0
Bananas (1971)	"style of humor more akin to some of his quirkier short stories in other films of the early 70s. While this isn't as successful in that regard as Sleeper or Love and Death, I'd still watch it again if it was on TV; even the romantic subplot, undercooked in comparison with the rest of the more satirical stuff, is interesting. from power . .. or maybe that freedom is worth fighting for . . . or maybe that some causes are worth laying down your life for. Obviously, there's relevance in all of that for us, today. Or maybe the whole point of this movie could simply be that Woody Allen knows how to make people laugh.  Later, Art imagined this, and it's quite brilliant. Underneath the one-liners and crazy situations is a statement about the war in Vietnam and the way it was reduced to sports reporting on television. To make his point, Howard Cossell is on hand for a play by play of the character's wedding night before an audience.Total Woody, with some hilarious moments. Highly recommended.  in the ridiculous and inspired opening, ABC's Wide World of Sports arrives in San Marcos to commentate the assassination of the current President. Later, Howard Cosell returns to host the consummation of Fielding's marriage, with an enthusiastic crowd watching the awkward couple tussling beneath the covers. 'Bananas' is a type specimen of one of Woody Allen's ""early, funny movies."" pass unnoticed while he's buying a pornographic magazine, and his reaction to the line ""You're not tense, are you?"" are among the many highlights. It does have its dead spots, though, and some rather too obvious jokes that can't match the level of the rest (the closing sequence does not work at all, IMO). Marvin Hamlisch's score is unbelievably catchy. "	7.1	0

Do yourself a favor and watch A Fish Called Wanda and you will wonder why you haven't seen (or in many cases even heard of) this film before. don't laugh, check your pulse. We have only been given a handful of good comedies in the last decade. A Fish Called Wanda is a treasure. **** out of ****.NOTE: TBS and some other TV networks show this film with the ""offensive language"" edited out.

Kline won an Oscar for his role and, everybody who has seen ""A Fish Called Wanda"" will agree on the fact that this was a well-deserved price. for themselves, hilarity follows. The humor in this film is clever and constant, never letting up for a minute. Watch especially for Kevin Kline's performance of Otto, it's one you'll remember for years to come. His attitude and his character suit him so well. His contrast with John Cleese's Archie Leach is phenomenal. A must see for all. Brilliant film. die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar.

Gene Hackman, the extraordinary Estelle Parsons, Michael J Pollard and even Gene Wilder complete the cast of this extraordinary American film. a possible 'aargh' for the bad guy and more solemnity for the good one. Arthur Penn opened the Pandora Box that would inspire ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The French Connection"" and ""The Godfather"" and only for that cinematic accomplishment, he deserves respect and admiration. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is a landmark and definitely one of the most important films of American history. Bonnie through a yellow corn field, while a cloud transverses the sun and slowly shadows the landscape...

Another updating about Clyde Borrow and Charlie Parker existence are : ¨Bonnie Parker story¨(1958) by William Witney with Dorothy Provine and a rendition for TV(1992) by Gary Hoffman with Tracy Needham and Dana Ashbrook. would have been worthy winners, as it is they gave out just the one to the least strongest performance from Estelle Parsons, go figure.

Pinkerton, never trying too hard to make us hate him. Ning Liang is one of the most sympathetic Suzukis I know of, and Sharpless shapes his music beautifully.

Many people might not like that.The sets are beautiful, and the movie was made full of details, to really show the Japanese habits, thoughts and life style. Frédéric Mitterrand had even the concern of choosing Asian actors to play in the cast, much better then Jean Pierre-Ponnele's version, where all of the actors are westerns. There is a poignant scene when the devoted Butterfly relinquishes her son to Pinkerton's wife. He will go back to the States and be educated there. What future is there for Butterfly? (Tissues may be required at this point!)The ending is heart-rending. I am not a particular lover of opera but after this exciting experience I am ready for more. flaky (sort of like the mother's spirit in ""Like Water For Chocolate""), but the film was otherwise quite moving.

This is no less a classic in its genre than Maltese Falcon or the Matrix.See it, rent it, buy it. But don't forget it. relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing ""Havanna Nights"", this one they should have left alone. the setting, the dancing, and well ... the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it. done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: ""Where are they now?"" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!

Reservoir Dogs (1992)	"The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten. Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. In short, a great example of good noir cinema (with all its ingredients: shootings, violence, betrayal, suspense, etc.), but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director, who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful ""Pulp Fiction"". Oh, and the scene from the beginning with ""Little Green Bag"" is legendary. 10/10 there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now. director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate. character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/***** "	8.3	1
Platoon (1986)	"war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10 The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It's emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10 time out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old cliché, but if you only watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close. but he makes us support him in a strange way.  The support cast are all good and contains a few famous faces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man show.Overall this is brutal and violent with no happy ending.  At the end of the day isn't that what a war film should be? flawsIt's a shame to see war films from the last few years devoid of scathing anti-war sentiments like the ones seen here . PLATOON screams at you "" War is hell and whatever the rights and wrongs of conflict you need a bloody good reason to wage war . Vietnam wasn't a good enough reason to sacrifice human lives "" "	8.1	1
Weekend at Bernie's (1989)	fun to hate.  Ignore the other comments on here, and go get this one.  It's great for some laughs and I STILL get a lot out of it everytime I watch it.  A great semi-black comedy.  Go pick it up and look for the sequel.  I enjoyed it as well, although not quite as much. as it can.  His uncanny ability to play a stiff corpse for nearly the whole film is truly revolutionary.  If there was ever a performance that was overlooked by the Academy, it may be Kiser's role here (do not laugh).  Overall the film over-achieves and is well-worth watching at least once.  3.5 out of 5 stars. the best. Anyone with a sense of humor will love this movie. your funny bone. It even might make you `drop dead from laughing'. Oh.was that to corny.sorry. But honestly, this is a good film. Give it a try someday when you have nothing else to do or are having a party. (But beware just rent this one. The second one, although it has its moments, doesn't meet up to the original) movie with loads of quirky characters. Andrew McCarthy at his most charmingly loopy and Jonathan Silverman terrific as his straight arrow buddy. Great turn by Terry Kiser as  Bernie, who will not go away or play dead. Ridiculous situations that are just plain fun to watch. A movie to remember with delight and to enjoy at a repeat viewing. 	6.4	0
Basic Instinct (1992)	"she hasn't done much of note since). Michael Douglas does a solid job also, but I can't help wondering if a better actor like Clint Eastwood could have brought more to the table. The dialogue is not up to the level of ""Pulp Fiction"", but it's still interesting and fun. I highly recommend this film for fans of adult mystery. with perhaps one exception, and no discrimination is given in any way. The other issue was, of course, the sex scenes which ,although explicit, are really rather passé these days.The film is stylishly filmed, expertly paced, brilliantly directed and has a superb music score from Jerrry Goldsmith. I'll give it a high score(by my standards) of 8 out of 10 it.........8/10P.S. If you like this one, check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically. large part of Catherine's character and are a fundamental part of the plot. The film would be unthinkable without them but shouldn't be reduced to them either. Naturally don't watch it with your kids, but if you're not scared of some nudity and like thrillers you'll love this one since it keeps one on the edge right until the end. people needed to show there ID to get into the local cinemas, because of its sexual and violent content. I don't blame the cinemas for doing so, because it is not suitable for young eyes to see. If you want to watch a great thriller, then sit down and watch Basic Instinct.

Doors, The (1991)	"my opinion. The '60's, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.Overall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it's not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora's Box. wish fulfillment than tragedy. My only significant criticism of the film is that the title is certainly a misnomer; this could have easily been titled ""The Jim Morrison Story"" as there is not a single scene on screen without the eccentric singer while the remaining members of the band are relegated to obscurity. Call it art imitating life once more. that even give much consideration to the single most important aspect of the motion picture.  The genius of this film is that it is visual-audio as opposed to audio-visual and is more concerned with expressing something than simply impressing the audience.  The Doors is a refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten. no effect on it as a whole.Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: ""Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?"" films of that era which also ""tell it like it really was"": ""Medium Cool"", ""Easy Rider"", ""Alice's Restaurant"", and ""Zabriskie Point"", to name a few.Despite a noisy, irksome second half, ""The Doors"" is an intriguing film about an intriguing historical figure. Mr. Mojo Risin's ""style"" may have died with the times. But Jim Morrison, himself, lives on ... as legend. "	7.2	0
Crying Game, The (1992)	"in to the film, which has almost dream-like qualities.If you were planning to see it just because of the ""twist"" and to see what everyone was talking about, then see it. If you were planning to see it for the amazing script, acting and direction - see it. And if you were planning on not seeing it - see it in their willingness to do just about anything to advance their cause(s). It's also a powerful, if strange, story of human love. Complicated, deeply felt, real love. The kind that would make you sacrifice virtually everything to prevent the one you love from suffering pain. Excellent acting makes this a worthwhile investment of time. A film to remember and cherish. points that rankle are Whitaker's dream-sequence appearances looking like a model in a detergent ad & Dil's suddenly-acquired shooting skills which brings the movie to its horrific climax.A brilliant movie with layers & layers of depth, & comparable to Jordan's earlier 'Mona Lisa'. That is saying a lot because Mona Lisa walks into my Top 50 movies without even knocking! insight and understanding of the degree of heart and soul which can and does exist in some people.I would recommend it to anyone who is attempting to understand humanity and some of the trials and tribulations it puts itself through.It is classified as a ""teaching movie"" specializing in unconditional love, or ""fiction with a definite positive purpose"".  Beautiful work. was some of the best in years. And the direction was outstanding. And the costume design, art direction, makeup, and score were all amazing. The song The Crying Game also caught me as particularly wonderful. The Crying Game is a classic in every way. It makes a lasting impression and should be viewed many times. It is a true classic.

A very human thing.Eventually, these men prey not only on customers, but on each other. It's vicious. If you don't understand why, all you'll see is the viciousness, and you probably won't enjoy the film. with Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce - not to mention a then-relatively-unknwon Kevin Spacey.If you can appreciate powerful acting, films based on dialogue with few scene changes, and can withstand an absolute barrage of foul language (which I must add is perfectly suited to this film), then this movie will blow you away. sales...Ben Affleck's performance in ""Boiler Room"" has shades of Baldwin's performance in this movie...not a bad thing, just an observation. Baldwin's best acting is this 5 minute scene and his ""I am God"" speech in ""Malice"".Amazing acting all around, tight realistic dialog (first time I saw this, I could almost say the words before they were spoken) Highly recommended! 10 a variety of people, and have yet to meet a female who liked it. This seems to categorize Glengarry Glen Ross as perhaps one the more masculine, testosterone soaked, man-only films ever. Like wild male animals fighting it out in the jungles. Despite that, I say this is definitely a must see for guy and gal cinema lovers all over. basically not possible to show it on network television. This may be the primary reason the film has slipped through the cracks over the years, and not made many top 100 lists and so forth. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then DO NOT MISS THIS FILM! 10 of 10 stars the Hound. "	7.8	1
Sophie's Choice (1982)	"forever. Meryl Streep as Sophie asked that question 35 years ago. Amazing! What a devastating treat.

His role is very important to this movie.But the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep just digs down deep here - delivering lines that just put a chill down your spine. draw closer and closer to the ultimate horror. The movie is nicely shot and some of the Brooklyn scenes look as though they actually could have come from a 1940s movie. But no director from the 1940s would have confronted the brutalities of the Holocaust so directly, and few actresses from any era could have given a performance like Streep's. who befriends Stingo (Peter MacNicol), while she tells him of her tortured past in a concentration camp. As always, she does her foreign accent without fault, and puts her all in her performance, better than she's ever done. The movie itself is very good, too -- it may drag at times (at 2 1/2 hours), but definitely worth a look. journey. Anyone, but especially anyone who is a parent, would have to be an emotional rock to not be absolutely haunted by this story. As much as I have studied and pondered the Holocaust, this film has connected me to those events more emotionally than I have ever been before.This film, and Ms. Streep's performance, are a gift to humanity.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)	me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago. This film is a truly timeless film, and will always be remembered. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg films. (And that is no easy task) A Timeless Classic 10/10 of Spielberg's greatest films, 'E.T.' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history. A remarkable adventure that acts as both a touching family drama and an exciting sci-fi flick, and one that needs to be seen by all. up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it. times it is all too often seen that children are desperate to become adults and lose their innocence far too quickly. This story in which S.S developed helps adults to return to that time.I would give this film 11/10.

Search for One-eye Jimmy, The (1996)	"title character, a sleazy and dimwitted housing project type, and what his disappearance has on his friends and family. The search is made into a documentary by a film student (Colt McCallany), and most of the film is in the form of a ""mockumentary.""I highly recommend this movie. If you like what you see in the cast, you'll love it! his performance (that dance!) in ""One-Eyed Jimmy"" is easily the most hilarious thing he's ever done (although I'll agree with another reviewer here that his character in ""The Big Lebowski"" is pretty damn funny too).Ignore the low average rating you see here. If you like any of the brilliant character actors in this film, especially John Turturro, you'll enjoy it. as the Red-Hook-local-dance-legend, Disco Bean.

When Jimmy goes missing, they all half heartedly look for him, not really caring whether he shows up or not, and the results are hilarious! This film is a rare gem, well worth seeing!

A great movie! it at many video stores (I have frequented many video stores in many cities in many states over the last 10 years).

This was definitely one of those rare times. and Wright Penn add a nice level of class to the proceedings.The dark and morose atmosphere might at first shock, but ultimately both children and adults will gain more from this experience than most family films. See it on the big screen.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic) Parade, we all have our list of must-see holiday movies, no matter how many times we have seen them. I really expect this to make this list, with one caveat- I'm not sure how well the non 3-D version will translate to the TV screen. But the story is timeless and this movie does a good job of telling it. plays several main characters with great skill.Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel. Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids. as it became with the years... 'A Christmas Carol' gains a lot from 3D being a sensorial experience enhanced by IMAX technology.All in all, it's not a story for kids, because it's rather disturbing and contemplative. Gary Oldman's pointing finger will stay with you for a while... It's an enchanting story and I encourage you to go and see it. 	6.8	0

It's just another mindless action movie to help relieve boredom.  7 out of 10. penned by Bob Towne, is far more clever than the average action movie and actually creates some serious character depth for Cole and Rowdy, although Cary Elwes' character seems excessively evil.But, all in all, this is an action movie that works for Cruise fans, even if they don't like action movies. 8.5 out of 10 (On a pure enjoyment basis). and to the point, and if its forward momentum you are looking for in your movies then you've come to the right place.

Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. are both winners in this film.There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge.

It rocked then... it rocks now. Just watch it and have some fun. the flying. I don't think that any movie, before or since, has ever rendered air combat in a more convincing and dramatic fashion. For nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been the modern equivalent of olden knights, men who brought a sense of glamour and romance to the deadly art of war, and this movie gives them a fitting tribute.8/10 death scene, a euphoric victory scene and of course, some unforgettable action scenes. What more could any red-blooded child of the eighties ask for!? And anyone born around 1980 will remember how everyone was doing that double high five and saying 'talk to me, goose' to the kid next to them in class. Certainly one of my all time favourites. get on here and give it some love and vote it up, if only to get it ranked above a lot of the rubbish ranked highly.It's also worth watching the DVD extras/Making of Top Gun if you liked the film as it's pretty interesting stuff and very funny in parts, as some of the trivia about the film is fascinating. Gun appeals to me...Imagine yourself on a Saturday night, not painting the town red staying in for the night. You have your few cans of Budweiser, your nachos what more could you ask for.From the amazing flight sequences, Mavericks motorbike, trashy romance and to the cool 80's soundtrack. Top Gun should be taken for what it is. An entertaining Film. "	6.9	0

Apart from the spot-the-actor aspect, there's not a whole lot to recommend this movie. foreseeable, but still not the most obvious way out.Yes, I'm impressed by this little study of human nature. Although the persons depicted are odd creatures, in rare circumstances, something general is being stated about man, about society, about the very torment for each of us in trying to find fulfillment. And that's the same, whatever the nation or its anthem. beautiful - too intelligent and too brilliant - because apparently some people - some reviewers - lack a soul or have an empty one and simply can not see outwardly what does not exist within.The mesmerizing acting of Jennifer Tilly is worth the price of admission in itself - but all the acting in this movie goes beyond just good. quirky characters. The liberal quantities of violence are tempered by a fresh and unpredictable script. Incredible cast, incredible dialog, with above average character development. The beautiful desert locale photography adds immensely, and the soundtrack is memorable. I recommend going into this movie without reading any plot summaries, and simply coming along for the ride with these unforgettable characters. - MERK a dead horse. A self-conscious, contrived gallery of oddball characters are simply derived from parts of David Lynch, and the Coen brothers, with some sub-Tarantinoesque dialogue thrown in. Unless you, as a viewer, enjoy picking out odd character actors, then I suggest slowly backing away from this film because 'there is nothing to see here folks....'Grade: * out of ***** 	5.3	0
Rebel Without a Cause (1955)	"certainly added more to the disjointed feeling and wasn't just there for style purposes like todays movies.The only point at which the film falters is the pat resolution between Jim and his parents at the end. But the ending is great otherwise, with a wonderfully framed shot of the observatory, proving Jim's theory that the world will end at dawn. teenager would view it as.  This can account for the sequences which many would see as over the top.  I think the central theme of the cosmos presented in the planetarium show demonstrates how teenagers view themselves as the center of the universe.  Thus all the scenes concerning each of the three teens conflicts are equally dramatic. other people are afraid of - staring down death is just a way for him to kill time. But, he's afraid, something just isn't right with his life. And most importantly, even if he never really does connect with this ""typical town"" filled with ""typical people"", Dean does indeed connect - to anyone whose ever been young - and alone..... parents are a little overblown and too quickly resolved at the end. But the appearance of an ""emasculated"" Jim Backus (he wears an apron in case we don't quite get it!) is a sight for sore eyes. A little dated in the world of today but so far ahead of its time in 1955.9 out 10. Satisfying on many levels. anything but a moron. His actions provide an easy way for the director/writer to answer all questions about his character, and then to facilitate an ending which is tragic, but more than a little contrived.Despite what I feel is a cop-out ending, _Rebel Without a Cause remains a thoroughly powerful film.

Streetcar Named Desire, A (1951)	"a great adaptation that has been seized upon a great cast who deliver a collection of performances that deserve all the praise heaped on them, all directed with a real sense of atmosphere that really delivers a seedy and erotic film both for its time and today. I cannot think of an excuse for people not having seen this film. from a play, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is very talky. Generally, I don't care for films burdened with a ten thousand page script. But this talk-fest is an exception. Overwhelming what I would otherwise consider a weakness, the acting of Brando and Leigh alone are enough to justify a two hour investment, and render an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience. Hunter, Karl Malden. I don't think you could dream up a finer cast. Brando might have been the sexiest thing alive, but it's obvious that Leigh made this film great with some memorable help from some movie icons. Brando may have sent an Indian to receive his second Oscar, but Leigh used her second as a doorstop to her bathroom. agrees that she plays this Hamlet of female roles better than anyone because he felt she was quite like the character...sadly.If anyone is interested in great acting check out ""Streetcar"" for Vivien Leigh's Academy Award winning performance. The supporting cast is outstanding from Kim Hunter and Karl Malden (both Oscar winners for the film)to, of course, the iconographic T-shirt-torn Brando. of sanity. Marlon Brando embodies a sense of brooding masculinity that other men can only dream of attaining, while creating an enduring cinema icon and delivering one of the all-time great movie lines. From the raucous jazz score to the sleazy production design bathed in smoldering grey, 'Streetcar' is a class-act from beginning to end; sexy, brutal, and endlessly fascinating. "	8.0	1
Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering (1996)	"manages to keep things moving and even a little suspenseful. This fourth installment also has a very high rating on the gore scale as well with some rather gruesome killings. If you have not yet seen this one but have others in the series it is worth the time. However, all said, it is for hard core genre fans only. Gathering is a different kind of CotC movie, but almost all of them are different, that's one of the things i like best about this series, unlike Friday the 13th where every movie is exactly the same, you know what they say, Children of the Corn movies is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. to be. It didn't really have a thing to do with the other children of the corns other then the fact that the kids were evil.

It's a ""Children of the Corn"" sequel, so obviously it is not a flawless film, but it is well-shot and there are a handful of genuinely effective moments to be had, and the film paces itself well without devolving into schlock.

I have no interest in bugs, but if youre ready to be enlightened; this will do it for you. insects, insects make love to other insects, plants and vice versa, chrysalis change into butterfly, etc., etc. And did I mention tender snail lovemaking? :)There is whole new world under our feet. Everything so small and so amazingly beautiful at the same time. Don't let it stay unnoticed. Go and watch this film immediately (and see Winged Migration as well). watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however: the sound these insects make. With the camera-work, it makes you feel as if you, too, were a small object on the ground listening to these strange sounds.Obviously, this is a unique film and highly recommended. see another insect in the same way as before.If you read some comments complaining about the little-to-non-existent narration is because they fail to understand this ""documentary"" is not about getting the facts straight. It is an experience and as such it is to be lived not to be told.Sit on the grass, observe, and paint the daughter of the dragonfly. their appearances, movements, actions and searches for food.

Palookaville (1996)	"Taylor and writer David Epstein aren't making a tract, they're making a film about characters we can relate to, and while it lags at times, this is surprising, funny, and touching. Also, the performers are all good(this is an early look at the talents of Kim Dickens and Vincent Gallo).  One of the more under-rated films of the year. all the while chowing down doughnuts and brownies.  With this film, Parker creates a familiar oddball trio with, while not completely appealing personalities, an overall charming combination.  Forsythe's seriousness plus Gallo's wit and Trese's goofiness makes a film that made me laugh out loud and left me smiling, but in an independent rather that cheesy way. Definitely recommended. saw the year it came out. American indie comedy/character cinema at its best. The trouser sniffing scene almost got me ejected from the cinema for laughing too loudly. This movie is an absolute triumph. Around the same time I caught 'Big Night', 'The Daytrippers' & 'Buffalo 66' - all great films. If you liked any of them you'll love 'Palookaville'. roles I've ever seen for the kind of pets MY friends have in real life. My wife was so caught up in her identity with the lives of the characters, that she was at one point heard to remark ""Oh, no! Don't let something bad happen in this film!"" Almost made us want to go and live in New Jersey. I found it a well written (sharp yet real dialogue) with respect for it's characters  finding humour in their situations and approach rather than making them comedy characters.  Add this to some well pitched performances and it makes for a film that does what it sets out to do and does it better than many of it's ilk. "	6.6	0
Associate, The (1996)	"the best in its genre, and Dalziel's one-liners sometimes make you laugh your head off!

UK can certainly make my evenings a lot more fun. lot a scenes are shot in the West Midlands. There are now over 30 episodes and the early episodes also chronicle the progress of DS Pascoe's ( Later Detectective Inspector) family. An other regular, who has been absent for the past few episodes is DS Edgar Wield. The rugged Sergeant Wield is gay, but this is only occasionally referred to. books, whereas recently the writers have thought up original, and often superior story lines for the show. What really sets this series apart from other modern detective dramas is its gritty realism and complex plotting. With every episode of 'Dalziel and Pascoe' you are guaranteed an unpredictable and intelligent mystery, played out by excellent actors in atmospheric and realistic locations. considering the novel versions, the series is a cut above the standard fare in the UK, let alone the US, and is literate, funny, intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting, direction, pacing and scenery are completely credible and it is a treat to suspend reality to watch this - and the other UK coppers like Barnaby, Frost, Morse, et al. comments made by contributors to IMDb -- that once they ran out of Hill's stories the writing very well may have suffered. But does anyone know if more ever will be broadcast in the USA; and whether the DVDs (in appropriate formatting for the USA) ever will be offered for sale here? Please...someone help me.

Funeral, The (1996)	"make you feel that a more complicated plot would be absolutely unnecessary.  All the important bases of small-time mob life are covered here - God, family, revenge, lies, anger, etc.  If you can sit down and watch a movie that chooses atmosphere and character over action, then I highly recommend this movie.  You will be blown away. I wholeheartedly recommend it. If this is your first experience of Abel Ferrara and you enjoy it, I suggest the moody 'The King Of New York' (also with Christopher Walken) next, then his powerful 'Bad Lieutenant' (Harvey Keitel) and his difficult but rewarding 'The Addiction' (Walken again). Those four movies are his best to date, and not to be missed. pretentious and a little boring, it also contains many potent, unforgettable scenes, most notably those featuring Chris Penn, who I frankly didn't think could act until I saw this movie.""The Funeral"" is an unremittingly dark film that at times achieves a terrible beauty. I'm not sure that I would recommend it, but I am extremely glad to have seen it. but deep within you enter the souls of each character who question their values as they mourn the death of a family member. Each one carrying a dilemma to the very surprising ending. This film could have been set in any era as it deals with intelligent issues such as the complex male macho image as questioned by Sciorra's character. Tempio brothers.""The Funeral"" is a violent movie directed by Abel Ferrara with great characters that are developed through flashbacks along the main storyline. There are great performances and scenes but unfortunately, it seems that neither the writer nor the director knew how to end the story that has an unsatisfactory conclusion.

Single Girl, A (La Fille Seule) (1995)	"who's at a crossroads in her life. It's filmed in real time, meaning there are no cut-aways that skip time. If Valerie needs to get somewhere, we watch her walk to that place. There's no narration or ""traveling"" music. It's as if we are Valerie. What makes the film work so well is the wonderful, subtle performance by Virginie Ledoyen. though she has an attitude, is arrogant and acts a bit too wise for a girl her age, she remains absolutely fascinating throughout the film.The lack of plot hardly mattered to me, because it's compensated by Virginie Ledoyen's radiant presence. This is the perfect example of a film where one actor or actress completely makes it work.Camera Obscura --- 9/10 young, you worry for her, but she can take care of herself. In the end she seems awesomely, unfathomably self-sufficient.This movie seems to be about female power. A good pairing would be with Sautet's A Simple Story, about an older woman also outwardly ordinary (though beautiful) but with amazing contained power, a kind of integrity beyond any men she encounters. break and has got to get back!But everything that happens to Valerie is so very real and so very urgent because the film is shot in real time. This was a daring attempt by the director, Benoit Jacquot, but his gamble hits the bullseye. Of course, with Virginie Ledoyen to follow around with his camera, Jacquot could hardly go wrong. might smile into the camera, but its movements are deliberate and elegant, making the film's 'realism' seem very  contrived.  This wouldn't be a problem if the film had used artifice to recreate the heroine's inner life - instead all we have is a big modern hotel, a bit of talk, unyielding characters, and lots, oh lots, of corridors.

People vs. Larry Flynt, The (1996)	makes it rather limited.  I don't agree with Gloria Steinhem's contention that the film ignores his depraved side, but I think the film would have been more interesting if it had addressed the opposition he had from both the left and the right.  Still, this is a terrific and important film to remind us what freedom really is. least a few more emotional scenes with Larry, to explain his actions better. Overall, a very good drama. Recommendable to most fans of the genre, as long as they can stand what the movie shows them. If you have an open mind, you're not too easily offended and you're into autobiographical dramas, this is a good film to watch. 8/10 my mind, entirely repugnant. But if Larry and Althea truly had the sort of relationship portrayed they loved each other beyond all reason, and what he did makes him a great patriot. How many people would do what he did in defense of such an idealistic belief? Not all people who do great things for great reasons are great people. mainstream society to understand or relate to. Flynt is humanized and so are those who cross his path throughout the picture. The movie is not as wild and crazed as one would think. Instead Forman uses well-timed comedy with drama to get the major points across effectively. Overall one of the better films of 1996. 4 stars out of 5. character which make him whole person. instead of seeing what Christian-right zealots, or bleeding heart liberals, tried to force upon me, i saw the entire man and all he brought with him. granted this was shown primarily thru scenes written and directed by milos forman, however, it is harrelson who brings them to life and convinces me of their sincerity. 	7.3	0
Plutonium Circus (1995)	"full of heart and soul and the poignant humor that comes from recognizing our universal vulnerability to the human ability to adapt, even to what is essentially insane. Aside from the core message, it's a delightful foray into the world of Amarillo's fascinating and sometimes eccentric townsfolk - as local Stan Marsh says, ""it's the wind that makes us crazy."" that Amarillo has a population of 200,000! It seems like the creator wanted to create a cartoonish image of thousands of ignorant locals and an evil corporation that manipulates them. The documentary presents no evidence that this is the reality of the situation. I'm sure the good people of Amarillo consider the town portrayed in this video to be unrecognizable. a fair-sized city.I guess the film never made it onto commercially-available video, which is too bad.  I never heard any more about it after its initial run at the Dobie Theater here in Austin TX.  I vaguely remember hearing about Stanley Marsh 3's shenanigans landing him in trouble, and the film's release was tied up in the process. "	6.4	0

It is honest, and good for a laugh. fight against communism, and became a favorite of the extreme right, while alienating more moderate possible supporters. In this documentary, with plenty of footage of the campaign, neither candidate seemed worthy of anyone's vote, with it's footage of Robb dancing around direct questions and claiming he had never told a lie in his life, and North courting the hard right. it getting 45.6% of the vote to Ollie's 42.9%.

Even more interesting is how since this setback, North went on to reinvent himself (again) as a news commentator. movie becomes more interesting because the filmmakers obviously never thought Robb could win re-election.The great thing about this documentary is all of the scenes with Douglas Wilder. He was the first black governor of Virginia and ran as an independent in the Senate race for a while. The racial issues explored is the main reason why this is worth getting. "	7.3	0

I have always enjoyed it, and most likely will always enjoy it. opportunity of cuing up this film-- as well as the other `Panther' movies-- at will.  For a lot of laughs, take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers and discover what `classic' comedy is all about.  It never gets old, and somehow just keeps getting better with age.  I rate this one 9/10. in trying to solve the case. Standout scenes include Clouseau going to Charle's Lytton's home posing as a telephone repair man, a runaway vacuum cleaner a fantastic escape by Charles Lytton from some thugs. There are many great moments in this film, and I would highly suggest it not only for a lot of laughs but for the comedic story. gleaming with hilarity with a genius at play.The result is a comedy which has its obvious flaws but also one which has many, many memorable and rip-roaring laughs.  Return Of The Pink Panther is an irrestible treat and a must-see.  I'm just having trouble figuring out which is better - this or Strikes Again.  They're both great! very funny stuff, but not quite up to the standards set in some of the other films.For me, the sequence starting with Clouseau vacuuming Lady Linton's apartment is the best in the movie.  Our first meeting with Guy Gadua (sp?) is hysterical as well.Christopher Plummer is good, but Niven would have been better.  Too bad he was unavailable. 	7.1	0

I like to think of the film as more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all, wonderful. 9/10 slightly negative remark is that the story should have had a better, more explosive climax. Particularly because the first hour is so great, the ending seems quite tame. But, what the hell, this movie is a must for every film lover!

I am usually an action junkie, but these films just appealed to me as no other ever has.Even if you hate subtitles I guarantee that you will love this film, and an hour later you'll remember the characters speaking in English. No matter how tough you are, if your heart doesn't break for Jean, then it never will. I felt so much pain for a fictional character. The ""force of destiny"" (great sound track motif selection!) is nowhere as evidently crushing as in this movie.

Anyone who becomes a Beart fan is advised to rent Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud (1995).The two movies, prequel and sequel, work as a team. By virtue of its powerful denouement, however, Manon of the Spring is the standout of the pair. For the same reason, in my opinion, it is one of the very best films of the 1980s. end.

The graphic, fetishistic sexual encounters of Santa Monica Boulevard hustlers and their johns are merely clever sidebars to the main story of Monty and Jurgen's collaboration and romance.  HW is far too bizarre for mainstream moviegoers; a pity, as its themes are universal and their exposition right on target. One of the major drawbacks of gay films in this ilk is the acting.  So I'm not good-looking. Hey, we can't all be!  Anyway, aside from a few sick, sleazy moments designed to shock (but are mostly just boring), this is a much better effort than his earlier films.

Again, I think that must be the point. (The film's overall reason for existence seems geared toward a scene where LaBruce gets to suck face with a hustler.) The best scene in the movie is that with Castro and a baby in the bathtub, a scene that is essentially a rip-off (or homage) to ""Flesh."" 6/10 the German guy really gave me the creeps.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not homophobic and I like to see two guys kiss as much as any other red-blooded American boy but not these two...it really made me sick.

Dadetown (1995)	"one of many, but limited cultural markers of the late 20th century that successfully foreshadows the American cultural divide that we are still living with today. Dadetown was not widely distributed and because of that unfortunately, was not referenced in later and seminal works on American political culture such as John Sperling's ""The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America"" (2004). Dadetown highlights a problem afflicting communities and individuals all across the country as the face of business undergoes a change. We can no longer rely on our employers to provide for us. No jobs are safe. Whether in Dadetown or New York City, the bottom line worker is always the first victim of middle-management judgment errors and upper management selfishness. realistic performances from his myriad actors might probably be due to the reality that the film faces, i.e. the demise of the middle-class in America. Be afraid, be very afraid. But yuck it up at the same time. The film encourages us to laugh at the past, and move on. Also watch ""Wonderland"", a true documentry, that covers similar grounds. I could do it"" .  Still, this is a fascinating film if just for its concept and the acting by the apparently all non-actors is remarkably good and usually quite convincing.  Russ Hexter looks to have possessed a world of talent and a keen understanding of how documentaries, and just film in general, needs to and should look.  What is supposed to be poigant moments in a worker losing his job, instead becomes a futile attempt at sincerity.  They are clearly actors. No emotion. No caring.

The over-preachy socio-political mentality the filmmakers use to structure the dialogue make it difficult for the viewer to not feel like they are sitting in a women's studies course.

Three Lives and Only One Death (Trois vies & une seule mort) (1996)	"these varied, and interesting characters.It is a film not meant for everyone. The story is a weird and complex as anything put out by David Lynch. But for the lover of cinema, there is much to appease the appetite.

Much of what is happening today with Europe and the Euro was symbolically foreshadowed in the film.If you watched the film and didn't understand its underlying premise I suggest watching again. I am sure you'll experience an ""ah ha"" moment and will discover this crazy film of Mr. Ruiz's makes brilliant sense. too late and no real sparks fly.Whereas earlier Ruiz trusted intuition to take him to the place where ideas mean things, here he starts from ideas and structures as he goes on. It is all scaffold, elaborate, suffocating scaffold, with no edifice to support. Ideas cast adrift without anchor. Compare with the richness of his 80's films about sailing inwards. is as good as always. A tad confusing at times. Requires complete attention at all times. The ending is the best part, a very clever film. the same genre.  Great cinematography as well.  What the little chickadees do, you don't want to have done to yourself, I can assure you.. Funny and sad, and oh, so tolerant of sexual infidelity....a French movie, indeed.  And no offense meant to the wonderful French, without whom we would still 'be a dependency of England' (Gore Vidal). "	7.1	0

He was 90 years old when interviewed in the film, but seems almost childlike in his delight for his life-long passion.

He also narrates the story penned by Jim Carrol. Somewhat bleak, but never boring, this is a good choice for a second feature to bring home from the video store.

Far, FAR superior to Michael Mann's Ali, which lifted huge pieces from this documentary. While Mann's film provides much more for the eye, Gast's ""Kings"" is a superior example of pure storytelling. rein. It is almost comical when they show their shocked faces as Ali delivered the knockout blow. The best part of the film is where they play the song ""When We Were Kings"" at the end and show a montage of Ali's fights during his amazing career. You will look at these and realize how awesome this man truly was!!! Shortcomings of this film aside, I can watch it again and again, and cry every time.  And feel both shame and strength, and perhaps some hope, when confronted with Ali.  If I ever have children, they will watch this film, if only because I can find nothing else that I can say stands for what I believe in. is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa.

It's a portrait of some dark corners of America and shouldn't be missed. painted. Even with all this excellent work the film would be nothing without a knockout lead actor and Gary Sinise is that. He is totally committed to the character whether showing his bigotry or his humanity, a splendid piece of work. Frankenheimer's direction is sure handed keeping the interest level high as he moves through a most complicated man's life. really grow to hate the guy (granted, you don't admire him either). Another interesting performance in the movie is a very young Angelina Jolie as Wallace's second wife Cornelia.In conclusion, I don't know how good most of John Frankenheimer's movies have been, but this one is definitely worth seeing. Also starring Mare Winningham, Clarence Williams III and Joe Don Baker. Mare Winningham's perfect performance as Lurleen.  Like any Southerner, I'm more than accustomed to actors' ham-handed, mangled versions of Southern intonation and dialect, but Winningham was amazing.  She BECAME Lurleen Wallace.  At times you can be fooled into thinking that Winningham is lip-synching over an archival recording of Lurleen's speeches.  Everything about her performance is superb. 	7.3	0

I defy anyone to see this adaptation and not be moved by it; try and see in the cinema, where it undoubtedly has more power than on a small screen; and avoid the version dubbed into English.  'Le Retour de Martin Guerre' need to survive with its language and poetry intact. the ""original story"". That being said, the movie is not perfect and strays from the facts a great deal. Natalie Zemon Davis, herself, states in her introduction to her book that she was troubled by the film's creative license with history.Nevertheless, I recommend anyone to see this film yourself and make up your own mind. Better yet, read the book! rude but obviously not receptive to any kind of charisma and aura. With actors (as with people in general, right?) looks are not important. Whoever thinks that, should switch from watching films to watching models. There he can get empty beauty.My recommendation is: watch this film. You can hardly spend an evening in a better way. 10 out of 10. watch this movie.The casting is wonderful, especially the casting of Nathalie Baye as Martin's wife. Something in her eyes  perfectly reflects her character's sad life. She's beautiful. I imagine it's going to be very hard not to sympathize  with  her. Just watch this movie. I hope you'll be touched and enjoy it as much as I did. heartbreaker.  Every Depardieu fan should have a copy - in French, not dubbed.  You can't help but like the returning Martin, as played by Depardieu.  His talent at facial expression is wonderful.

This realistic style is very noticeable in TV shows today, such as ""Law and Order,"" and ""NYPD Blue.""As influential as ""He Walked By Night"" was, it is also a finely acted, finely directed, well-written, and intense police movie. It is being re-released on DVD under ""The Great Cops Movies,"" so don't miss it. also have given a few ideas to the makers of ""Them"" a couple of years later when they revisited the L.A. storm drains with their giant ants. Ultimately, Basehart's character remains an enigma. We never learn that much about him. ""He Walked By Night"" isn't a great film, but it's an enjoyable look at postwar police work and primitive forensics. drain must have inspired Carol Reed to put it in The Third Man where the idea got more notice.The lack of really big name stars gives this film a realistic approach. Look for Jack Webb in a supporting role as a police lab technician. I Don't doubt he got the idea for Dragnet from working on He Walked By Night. and scary villains I have ever seen. This is because he is NOT larger than life or obviously menacing. Instead, he looks like any other guy and can appear nice and harmless--only to steal or butcher without remorse. At the same time, the film is NOT overly explicit or gratuitous--it's just a wonderful portrait of a brilliant sociopath at work. "	7.2	0
Raw Deal (1948)	plenty of face-ripping and falling from burning buildings. That's not standard stuff, and if you can get into babe Trevor with light shimmering on her lips as she tries to figure out how to save her thug O'Keefe from the police, Burr, and the younger angel ready to steal him away, then you will enjoy hell out of this film. eventually fighting for their survival. There is one odd and highly improbable scene were they happen upon another criminal running from the police. It's good drama, but too coincidental, out in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. Otherwise the parts are strong, the story well paced.And the visuals just stunning. That's the biggest reason to watch. And get pulled away. joy to watch on the screen.Okay, so the story itself isn't the most original.  But with everything else this film has going for it, I HIGHLY recommend anyone even slightly interested, to go buy it NOW!  It's one of my absolute favorite film noir's. Oh...I almost forgot.  Check out Marsha Hunt in this film.  She's stunning. and deceived by basically everyone to some degree. Claire Trevor's struggle to come clean at the end is a moving and suspenseful section and the violent climax is curiously redeeming and satisfying.  Noir fans should definitely give this one a look- not as famous as your typical Bogey or Mitchum entry, but just as iconic in its own way. but with Alton's camera it ends up being essential for the film noir faithful.From the opening, where the credits show up on the background of prison bar shadows, to the no cop out-classic noir-ending, Raw Deal hits the mark. A film that's bleak and at times brutal, yet rich in emotional depth. A must see for like minded cinephiles. 9/10 	7.3	0

The larger than life film-making, combined with the sober subject matter, almost tip this one into the realm of the surreal, as Mann and Alton were basically too talented for such mundane material, as essentially the script serves their talents, which are considerable, rather than the other way around. Routine as the story is, this is magnificent film-making. and in good noir style the tension mounts before they too become informed on.Our good guys blend well into the criminal world in their performances. But the outstanding acting in T-Men is done by hit man Charles McGraw and Wallace Ford who is aptly nicknamed Schemer in this film. This is definitely a film for fans of the noir genre. to the general disquiet hanging heavy in every room. While his construction of the films most shocking scene, involving a steam bath, is so good its been copied numerous times since.Not as gritty as Raw Deal, which Mann, Alton and O'Keefe made the following year, but still as tough as old boots and cloaked deliciously with a shadowy beauty. 8/10 hard-nosed agent who slowly earns the trust of the bad guys while his partner, Alfred Ryder, is his equal as the sacrificing newlywed whose duty to his country comes before his duty as a husband. The film offers a fascinating look into the world of undercover work and intrigue and even has an opening segment from the Treasury Office itself. noir characters and some great suspense over the last 10-15 minutes. What you have to wade through is the boring beginning but staying with it will be rewarding.I thought the grim story could have used a little warmth, at least some wisecracking with some floozy ""dame."" But, no molls in this story this is man's gangster film all the way. "	7.0	0

As one of the commentaries makes clear, the film had special resonance with the summer of 1942, just before war broke out. That only adds to its heart-wrenching power.

Even if De Sica hadn't gone on to make ""Shoeshine,"" ""Bicycle Thief,"" and ""Umberto D"" he already had enough in this one little film to earn respect as one of the supreme artists of the 20th century. of course it was director De Sica who was to work miracles later with the child actors of SHOE SHINE and THE BICYCLE THIEF. The conclusion to this heartbreaking film is no less unforgettable than those of De Sica's better-known masterpieces. It is one of the most indispensable of movies from Italy's fascist era. And it is shamefully unknown today. is heart-wrenching. I cried when I watched it. {blushing}This film made me a fan of neo-realism.

Probably these were performers who appeared in vaudeville with Burns and Allen themselves. What follows is one madcap situation after another as Gracie turns their home into a hotel for unemployed actors and then decided to produce her own show.As good as Gracie is, mention must be made of George Barbier. A fine character actor who played fathers, his blustering reactions to Gracie's schemes are worth seeing the movie in and of themselves. money hound), James Burke (as the fake swami), Syd Saylor (a credulous taxi-driver), and Harry Holman (a disillusioned crony).As for the twelve (count them) vaudeville headline acts announced in the credit titles, we see only two (three if you count the fact that drummer Jack Powell is handed two bites), although five or six others flit by in the background. Edward Everett Horton!!! THE TEAMING IS SO GREAT & PERFECT in such a teaming that Burns is delegated to that of Horton's straight man assistant & You Almost Forget About Him!

George and Gracie come back into ""Love in Bloom"" now and then to do a few of their jokes... it feels like they found a script, and added themselves into it. It's OK, but it's no Shakespeare. Its a story of falling in love with someone from the other side of the tracks. two attractive young actors whose faces you probably will never see again. Burns and Allen command about 10 minutes of screen time, but it is a pleasant little picture regardless.  It's a nice old film, with a pretty typical old plot line, and worth a look.  Just be forewarned that George and Gracie are not the leads here. appeared here and there to do some comedy routines and sing--but the usual banter between George and Gracie was noticeably absent. Sorry, despite the generally good reviews and overall IMDb rating, I cannot recommend you see this one--it's just not good nor is it what you expect.

Although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers, Mr.Page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film. the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy. Only Fields demurred. He felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The Studio finally agreed and began preparation of Fields' first solo starring feature, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934). It's difficult to imagine how this routine worked from the distance of a stage. But on film it's a miracle of comic construction, timing, delivery and skill (yes he actually ricochets that billiard ball off the far end of the table where it bounces back and hits his forehead). The routine is hypnotic and hysterical, and perfectly pitched for film. is a road-trip movie that's absolute nonsense.Ruggles and Boland make you laugh at them, with them, and for them; Burns and Allen take silly to a new level; and Fields and Skipworth show up later in the game to round out this sextette of psychos. Fields' billiard scene (reworked from one of his earlier films) is not to be missed. going absolutely nuts trying to figure her Monty Pythonesque reasoning about the whole world.

I recommend it -- especially for those who have seen only black and white view of World War II and the typically American view of our adversaries in German. senseless most of the time. The symbolism of the stuck German after WWI and the boy with a drum that refuses to grow-up is obvious but the 142 minutes running time entwined with disturbing and nonsense scenes give the idea of the intention of raising polemic to be in the spotlights. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Tambor"" (""The Drum"") Tin Drum also contains some objectionable scenes of childhood sexuality and grotesque depictions of slithering eels being caught using a severed horse head as bait. The result, needless to say, is stomach churning.I found The Tin Drum to be absorbing and thought provoking yet, despite moments of brilliance, for me it did not add up to a totally satisfying experience.

Bad Moon (1996)	"Moon is an enjoyable movie. Especially the morphing technique (when you actually see him turn into a werewolf) is cool to watch. The story may not always be the very original, it still does the trick. The same for the acting. There is nothing spectacular about it, but it is very decent and believable. I give this movie a 6,5/10. enjoyed Bad Moon anyway.If you are looking for modern-day, high dollar movie with tons of CGI effects - then this movie may not be for you. Bad Moon uses ""old school"" special effects that I still love to this very day.This is one of those movies I would enjoy watching again on a dark, rainy night with popcorn in hand.9.5/10 even though he tries his best to control his urges, it is all to no avail, and in the end someone close to him has to end his bloody reign of terror. The acting by the principles was reasonable, and yes the German Shepherd, Thor, did steal the show, but again, so what? I would even enjoy watching it again! from threats. It's also admirable how they managed to get the dog to certain things for the camera, as I imagine that sort of thing wouldn't be easy. While this film isn't a great example of a take on the werewolf legend, it's entertaining and I reckon that people who like werewolf movies will find lots to like about it. shouldn't he have also turned into a werewolf himself like Ted did or are werewolf bites only effective on humans not animals when it comes to making then into beasts! The answer may be that Thor being a dog he can't be effected by any werewolves bites since he's, I know this is very hard to believe, a beast already? "	5.8	0

So on moral grounds, I would give this movie a 10.  However, the plot was inconsistent at times, the acting was cheesy, and this type of movie has been made so many times that you get tired of just hearing about it.  Overall, I can only give this movie a 4. direction are seriously questionable but this film is obviously about fight scenes and they are entertaining enough, from the moment we see Gershon's house is full of glass tables, flimsy bookcases and china filled cabinets we know we are in for a treat.Terrible, patronising attitude toward racial issues but, hey, its got a rocket launcher and plenty of flying kicks. but not enough to allow Gina Gershon to fall in love with the Asian lead. They had to bring in a totally pointless white character for that... Dee Wallace-Stone is one of the greatest actresses who has ever lived and she is so sadly underrated and underused. She's the only thing in this film that isn't a really funny joke. 	4.8	0

What is the truth, and do I want to know? free nation comes with a huge responsibility; to carefully consider who we elect and what we value, and to allow those debates to have meaning.  ""Bob Roberts"" shows us how easily we can neglect that responsibility, and how easily voters can be sold an offensive, exclusionary message, when it is wrapped up in something more attractive than what's real. this film presenting politics as it really is, crooked and disturbing. The screenplay is brilliantly clever brimming with brutal honesty about the political battle in washington.Robbins plays the right-wing politician perfectly portraying a crooked yuppie business man willing to do anything to get elected to the US Senate a must see film one of the best films of the decade. Bob Roberts is a Joe McCarthy/Rush Limbaugh for the 1990's. Although they might seem harmless on the surface, they do pose real danger. This movie is important and should be seen by all voters. It tries to teach people to look at the facts and the real issues and put the fluff aside. Ahh, if only that could be done. crazy stunt near the end to try to sway voters in his direction which I'm surprised no real politician has done. James Spader does an absolute perfect parody of a news anchor. A very funny movie, particularly the songs Robbins sings. Brilliant satire. The final shot in this movie, like the one in Robbins' Cradle Will Rock, is very powerful. "	7.0	0

That's when the much talked about ""gross-out"" aspects of the film seemed to diminish in their ability to shock.

If you love movies, you will get a kick out of it. very funny and entertaining, with excellent acting by the main actors/actresses.  I particularly like the sharp riposte that Carlole Bouquet serves up to Michel Blanc on regular occasions as she shepherds him through his problems.  The banter between those two was so well written and spoken that I had to go back and listen to it many times. more farcical scenes like these; the film takes a little too much time before finding its way.Philippe Noiret figures amusingly in a slight twist at the end of the film. More important, he gets to make a speech lamenting the sorry state of the French film industry, and that would seem to be the real point of this whole exercise. "	6.4	0
Delicatessen (1991)	there.Overall, Delicatessen is a sublime piece of cinema. You wont find imagination and inventiveness to the extent that it is shown here in most films, and that alone is reason enough to warrant this classic status. Delicatessen is everything I say it is and more; and overall the film is one of the true highlights of the 1990's. A gem. has strange humor. Jacques Tati would have loved Delicatessen.Julie's 'tea ceremony' without her glasses, the mattress spring test, Aurore's failing suicide contraptions, it's all funny as hell. I hope everyone who is even marginally involved in making movies gets to see Delicatessen and learns from its greatness. We could sure use a touch of genius in most of them ...10/10 the slender storyline on occasions; here, the more `grown-up' themes and less fantastic design go hand in hand.(A word of warning about the video release- the subtitles appear to have been written be a couple of Frenchmen who really ought to have concentrated harder in their English classes at school. Apart from that, I wholeheartedly recommend this joyously grotesque film.) oddball romance in the same breath with equal gusto and therefore feels horrific, humorous, and haunting all at once. Every frame is a wonder of detail and originality that reinvigorates even the most jaded and long-time film viewer with the sense of rediscovering the art form. This is film-making in the highest regard worthy of praise, awe, and multiple viewings. suicide attempt too - hey I said it is darkly amusing!! I would say that there is not a weak performance amongst the cast in this evocative tale of futuristic cannibalism!!

However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions. minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. ""Paths of Glory"" is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message. venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies. become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.Paths of Glory is one of the best anti-war films ever made.

If this doesn't sound like another day at the office, you might just find the workplace of ""The Grifters"" intriguing. Seeing it today, I enjoyed it as much as I did years ago, before I opened my eyes for a fresh look at the world. the clown portraits on black velvet.

You'll think about it for some time afterward, the way I thought about that blow in the ring. intense. Bening is suitably perky, slutty and malicious. Huston is a knock out as she delivers a chilling performance. The score is quite low key (usually a piano track) except during dramatic sequences. The lighting has been well done.

The cast is amazing, especially David McCallum as a police inspector obsessed with capturing Locke, and Ned Beatty gives a very credible and warmhearted performance as Joseph Locke (although the singing is dubbed). The Irish countryside is breathtaking--as is Tara Fitzgerald--and the story is great fun in the tradition of Local Hero and Eat the Peach. Fintan, a concert promoter, and the two of them ride through the Irish countryside in search of the real Josef Locke in an effort to convince him to return to England to perform.  When they find him, the Irish comedy really begins, and also the Irish singing.  The tenor voice is spectacular and when Jo sings, women weep....... Rumour has it ""Hear My Song"" will be re-released on DVD in the UK in July '09....but a US release is still delayed so DVD makers can press more boxed sets of ""Dog, The Bounty Hunter"", anime, and Hannah Montana(whose ""movie"" was actually directed by Peter Chelsom, who directed and wrote ""Hear My Song"") Still, this is a wonderful movie, little movie with heart, wit, and charm, definitely worth repeat viewings.

It is worth a watch, but beware of a stretching of the 'truth' when it comes to packaging. toward her dancing troupe. Nothing else about her is revealed, except for a purely mercenary streak of exhibitionism, hardly front-page news.

Aliens (1986)	"had the DVD version but I trade it for Blu-ray because of the better picture quality, better special features and the DVD cut scenes from the film away even the special edition did that. DVD did not had any special features at all. 10/10 my personal action, sci-fi, horror masterpiece war movie of all time I love ""Aliens"" to death! version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy. performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating: 10/10 accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show! better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see. "	8.4	1
Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The (Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il) (1966)	Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.  A++ It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!! satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10 that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything. waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made. 	8.9	1
Withnail & I (1987)	"hilarious as the dangerous but lovable Danny.This is a film that will never be tarnished by age, and neither is it limited by repeat viewings. It is a very accessible film, despite its largely English humour, and 'Withnail' remains one of the best films about friendship. Certainly a one off, 'Withnail' is a must see film that will not disappoint. My Guitar Gently Weeps', by the late lamented George Harrison, who provided much of the financial backing for this memorable film.This is a thoroughly entertaining 108 minutes of humorous entertainment, a few too many drinks, a convincing 60's atmosphere, superb performances from the excellent cast, and music to make your heart, and your guitar, gently weep. Thank you, George Harrison. in film history as far as I'm concerned. Paul McGann is also excellent, and there are lovely performances from Richard Griffiths, Michael Elphick and Ralph Brown. EVERYONE is good in 'Withnail' but it's still Grant's movie all the way. He is just utterly brilliant! 'Withnail and I' is one of THE great British movies, and comes with my highest recommendation. heard people say that they found the plot lacking...but I argue that sometimes it's just nice to sit back and get swept away by a good character study.  Interesting and thought provoking, sometimes referred to as a ""cult classic"", I say it's just a classic - period.  Oh...and great soundtrack.  The closing music always gives me goosebumps. one of the best British comedies ever made and it breaks my heart to see voter's lists where things like Four Weddings top it! The delivery is great and the writing is consistently outrageous and hilarious.  The only downside of this film is  that director/writer Robinson has never topped this wonderful movie and looks like he never will. "	7.8	1

However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now. however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience.

Lawrence of Arabia (1962)	"sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a ""silly movie"" Wow, I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don't know what he meant. I love this film. Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us, to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more, discover something new. When I was 13 I didn't understand much, but this film helped me to see that I wanted more, knew more, than my peers. I can't rate it more highly than that. the matchstick to the desert sunrise, ""nothing is written"" - others too numerous to mention).The point of this rather rambling review is this - a movie that can evoke such passion in its admirers stands by itself, beyond reviews or criticism. If you haven't seen it yet I envy you, because you get to experience it for the first time. actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. One of the best films ever made. performances by O'Toole and Shariff (a shame they didn't get the statuette), but also, the ultimately heroic yet tragic figure of T.E. Lawrence, contribute in making this the most visually and emotionally sweeping film of the last 111 years.Such a shame that Lean retired for 14 years after ""Ryan's Daughter"", there's no way to know where he would have gotten.

Clockwork Orange, A (1971)	is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers. for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.Lastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through. most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself. down just as fast because it terrifies you. the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad. 	8.3	1

It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.  --Shelly came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10 be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10 is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10 filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen ""Mockingbird,"" I pity you.

Apocalypse Now (1979)	would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novelMy all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style! and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten. much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.Is Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?

For me, it exists on a plane of it's own, it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded. preparations against Frank: the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame: Bronson's stillness and self-possession, the emblem of his righteousness: Fonda's eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head, denoting the waning of his self-confidence: the amazing super-close-ups of Bronson: and the weird brick arch, the only man-made intrusion into the entire terrain, and the focus of human depravity. unfolding in front of your eyes with no censorship or BS added for flavor.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)	"my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+ ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo! Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans. episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why ""Return of the Jedi"" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release. three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library.

Third Man, The (1949)	"Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War. disease. Yet somehow his ultimate demise in the sewers brings into play an incredible sadness and compassion that has absolutely no right being there. It remains for me one of my top five film favorites. I have always given it a ""10"" personally but hey, to be voted an ""8.6"" universally is a pretty fair vindication of my words here. sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins.  The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.This is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies. shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery. be a more fitting symbol of the underlying nastiness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call ""civilization""?

The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse! Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit. too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+ the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.

The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10 every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R.

I fell in love with Jean Reno in this film.   Unforgettable imagery, interesting premise, good chemistry between Arquette and Barr, and Reno is a joy to watch. Masterfully directed by Luc Besson and a film to treasure. only way the movie shall be seen. What a masterpiece! After I saw this movie, I rewinded it thinking that my only wish is that one day I get to take part on such an experience, being there, dreaming and sharing my dream with everyone who would like to share it with me. Perhaps one day, a beautiful blue day... full blast surround. This movie is the reason to buy one if you don´t have it! Believe me ! And watch it in the dark.Try to get the european full version of the movie. The american is not that terrible, the feeling is there, but it´s diferent from the original.This movie is a masterpiece ! ( in any version ) extremely good, and although for me an irritating character Rosanna Arquette put in a reasonable performance. The cinematography is another lush element of the film, with the beautiful locations and underwater sequences (especially those with the dolphins). Eric Serra's soundtrack is pretty good also, although sounds a little dated. As mentioned, this review is based on the ""version longue"". 5/5 Serra has done a wonderfully emotive score that almost interacts with the scenes along the way.Overall I'd give this film a 9/10, yet again awesome direction, acting and soundtrack, and definitely in my top films! just a shame i've borrowed it off a mate and have to give it back tomorrow, it's definitely something i could watch again and again!

Ran (1985)	"Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius out these scenes without the intrusion of the camera or the editor. Thus, the director prevents the style from eclipsing the already powerful material he has to work with. Simply put, ""Ran"" is a masterpiece that flows and develops like an opera, from its forebodingly peaceful ouverture to its bloody Shakespearean heart until its final, quietly subdued, and sorrowful denouement. be heard, but in my opinion, it's Ran's finest scene, and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors, none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora, Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede (a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda), and the strangely-named Peter as Kyoami. give forgiveness (a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view), this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute must-see, and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film, much like Throne of Blood, contains none of the language style used in the source. up the aging lord. His trail of murder and predation is not forgotten, the brutally conquered land still carries the old scarves of war and exploitation which now burst out again.The viewer can take this monumental work as a warning to the destructive power of war, which is even decades later at present and beset those who seed the violence.

Killer, The (Die xue shuang xiong) (1989)	for.Overall: I think The Killer is on par with Hard Boiled but there's maybe a little more focus on the story than action....but the action in that delivers too. A pair with Hard Boiled is a it's truly bad ass. My favorite action movie with Hard Target and Hard Boiled! I love them to death it get's a perfect 10! this was undoubtedly the highlight of his career - Psychadelic Cop anyone? Sally Yeh also gives her most memorable performance, and a surprisingly convincing blind character for somebody that had no real acting training. Shing Fui On and Kenneth Tsang have never looked better either. In fact, for almost everybody involved this was probably the high point of their career.9/10 AHEAD.The ending of the killer is possibly the most downbeat in the history of cinema and nearly brought me too tears(ah jong's eyes explode after being shot several times).The killer is something you do not see in modern day movies...a film with a true meaning this story is of ethics honour and redemption and thats what makes it a classic. cool incarnate. His effortless lead and the tension created by his playing off of co-star Danny Lee make The Killer as close as I have yet seen to the perfect action movie. I recommend it to any hard-core action fan and also suggest Hard-Boiled, though Woo's American efforts thus far have not been up to his Hong Kong works.Rating: 10  Some people dislike the final shootout, but the doves and the Christian symbology adds a touch that drives religious and heroic bloodshed to the minds of the audience.  On a personal note, I love it.  The last few seconds depict a man, perhaps Lee, playing a harmonica in front of the church for reasons I don't know. 	7.9	1
Psycho (1960)	"an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film. surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative. to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins. so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car... attacked, the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally ""screams"" at you.I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again.

They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time. resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent. but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see. beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.10/10 finest films ever made. This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola's second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part.

Full Metal Jacket (1987)	"us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!A final note: It's interesting to compare ""Full Metal Jacket"" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's ""The DI,"" made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp. a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles. visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10. film or I should say, two shattering films. The first part, the training, the intro is a masterpiece practically impossible to match up, so, the second part doesn't match it. But, still. A film-experience. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance even more powerful now, 30 years later. Enormous! The British skies over Vietnam is another reminder than an artist's eye knows no boundaries. player, 20 minutes later conversation has ceased and everybody is absorbed. Predictable Kubrick really, stunningly lit, musical soundtrack that is oh-so-right, and the cinematography -Jesusmotherofmary. Ten years before anybody had thought of picking up a movie camera and running with it, Kubrick had perfected the technique. War is hell? -it sure looks a vision of hell. Stunning in every way.

Wallace & Gromit: A Grand Day Out (1989)	1962, he ran against Wallace and had a good chance at a third term until he appeared drunk on a tv show on the eve of the election. Folsom forgot the names of his children and gave an extended imitation of a cuckoo clock. The performance cost him the election and ended his career as an important politician in Alabama. of a number of lower body functions, she tries as best she can to adjust. A whole lot is against it though in both her's and his personalities.George Wallace is a much better than average made for TV product, it probably should have gotten a theatrical release. It's a portrait of some dark corners of America and shouldn't be missed. painted. Even with all this excellent work the film would be nothing without a knockout lead actor and Gary Sinise is that. He is totally committed to the character whether showing his bigotry or his humanity, a splendid piece of work. Frankenheimer's direction is sure handed keeping the interest level high as he moves through a most complicated man's life. really grow to hate the guy (granted, you don't admire him either). Another interesting performance in the movie is a very young Angelina Jolie as Wallace's second wife Cornelia.In conclusion, I don't know how good most of John Frankenheimer's movies have been, but this one is definitely worth seeing. Also starring Mare Winningham, Clarence Williams III and Joe Don Baker. Mare Winningham's perfect performance as Lurleen.  Like any Southerner, I'm more than accustomed to actors' ham-handed, mangled versions of Southern intonation and dialect, but Winningham was amazing.  She BECAME Lurleen Wallace.  At times you can be fooled into thinking that Winningham is lip-synching over an archival recording of Lurleen's speeches.  Everything about her performance is superb. 	7.3	0

Apparently mercy towards your own countrymen was not a virtue that Henry saw particularly important.The films greatest attribute is its soundtrack, particularly the use of music in the scene following the battle of Agincourt in which the warring parties collect their dead for burial.All in all, a fascinating look inside the mind of a king. the arte of Shakespeare.

The story is better told and moves about at a much better pace than previous Shakespeare films. Branagh started an incredible trend with this film.

The film won for Costuming. live performance on stage - I was privileged to see him (with Emma Thompson) perform Much Ado About Nothing in the late 1980s, and that's still the best I've ever seen.

Amadeus (1984)	"and you think, ""Whoa! Where did this come from?"" This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozart fan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad at all. piu andrai farfallone amoroso, from The Marriage of Figaro.As I said, I'm a huge Mozart fan, so my rating may be somewhat biased, but what the heck, I gladly give ten stars to Amadeus. I watched it close to a hundred times over the years, and it still gives me a great pleasure every time I see (and hear) it. the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away.  The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10. they found were quite often apropos to their needs.Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king. choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozart is pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. You can just sense that Mozart's inspiration drove everyone on this film to perfection. A must see film for all! "	8.3	1
Quiet Man, The (1952)	McLaughlin is hilarious and ultimately warm hearted. It sums up the strange Irish notion that you have to physically pummel a man before you can have his friendship and respect.There are big scenes and little scenes, but every scene is a delight.This is a movie that can't and won't ever be made again. It's a movie that everyone should enjoy. there alongside Ben Hur, Gone with the Wind and Casablanca and rent it out for a great nights entertainment. Better still go and buy a copy 'cos once you've viewed it once like me you'll most likely be hooked and will want to watch it again and again (Even sometimes late at night, round Christmastime, sipping a hot Irish whiskey!) Man is an annual classic for St. Patrick's Day, the same way It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. At least in America it is. I've wondered if it is as well received in Ireland as it is here. I think John Ford, the former Sean O'Fearna, was hoping it would turn out that way.Mr. Ford, you got your wish. Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney).  A delightful and endearing motion picture, `The Quiet Man' is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best.

Once Upon a Time in America (1984)	will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10. by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director's version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see. just as they were.The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination. a break!!) Just what in the hell were they thinking? Saw it in a theater 20 years ago and then again on TV about 1998 and finally in its correct format(on DVD) about two years ago and again last week at a friend's house. Stirred up all those angry thoughts all over again... sorry about that, getting' old & crotchety. and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.  There is a shortened, two-and-a-half-hour version of the film released that is a disaster.  It is like trying to understand a jigsaw puzzle with half of the pieces missing.

Raging Bull (1980)	"that will be remembered as their most daring effort is ""Raging Bull,"" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top. scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10 and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro's shadow.Overall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing.....this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century! ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it's positively breathtaking.No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80's but is one of the greatest this century that's highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.10 out of 10 And who is the only director who could realistically bring this to life? We all know the answer.Well done, Mr Scorsese. Regardless of what the pretentious fools responsible for the decisions that the Academy makes, the people are fully aware of who the best director in town is.""Raging Bull"" is flawless and perfect. 10 out of 10, all the way.

Annie Hall (1977)	"for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.10/10 `Annie Hall' is like a fond memory, or a favorite old song  anytime I have discussed this film with others their smiling expressions are usually tinged with a hint of nostalgia, because one can look back on either their past or current relationship and do what precious few films allow us to do  relate on a personal level.--Shelly with charm and panache. There's something innocent and benign about his obsessions here, as this was long before the Woody/Soon-Yi fiasco and the days of grossly miscasting himself against younger female co-stars. Yes, Mr. Allen has been artsier (witness ""Manhattan"") and more satirical (witness ""Zelig"") but here, with Diane Keaton as his muse, he was never more charming or funnier. just how very little happens, and that, by the film's end, our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning. Nevertheless, Allen manages to say something significant about human relationships  they're totally irrational, crazy and absurd, but we keep attempting them because of what they give us in return. Or, at least, what we think they give us. which add to the complexity of the characters.  This is a highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie is not about romance in the way that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is.  Rather, ""Annie Hall"" is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny and heartbreaking and always classic.  ""Love fades,"" indeed. "	8.0	1
Stalker (1979)	"landscapes or wide-shots or simply peering into his actors' extraordinary faces - make this almost hypnotic.STALKER is a treasure: an invitation to go on a mental ride with a poet and philosopher. A film that makes you wonder more about yourself yet without making you anxious. The few existing films like STALKER are the reason why cinema is called ""art""! giving solid answers to the questions his films posed. He sculpted his stories so that viewers who had the patience and self-discipline to stay attentive all the way through could draw their own conclusions. If there is any specific meaning to ""Stalker,"" it is that we have to fully understand anything for which we are willing to alter our lives. time ago"".   The film is slow...very slow but it has to be to put you into the mindset of the film.  After the opening 30 minutes the pacing actually draws you into the film in a more personal way more than any Cyborg-post-apocalyptic-hell crap Hollywood could spew out. This film is truly sci-fi, and truly great sci-fi. but no need. because every person understand those things different like kafka's novels. and we just need to watch the movie with no prejudice but with open heart.i recommend this film to all the cinema-lovers. i recommend also not to try to understand this film. only leave yourself to this great poem and it will give you all you need. the tiny worm that dances head-over-tail down his hand.A beautiful, great and puzzling film.  But then if it revealed all its secrets straight off then, apart from the beautiful visuals and the soundtrack it would be pointless watching it again.  Great art only leaches out its secrets gradually and only to those with the desire to learn them. "	8.1	1
Boat, The (Das Boot) (1981)	being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get. shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films. great score (this film's lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down. When the sweat starts to dribble upwards you know it's a cockroach crawling up your body. And that Klaxon. 'Hunt for Red October', 'Crimson Tide'. They are just adventure films. (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately! 	8.4	1
Sting, The (1973)	"first viewing, never fear, the second time of watching, you'll enjoy it just as much but it will mean more. Certainly it's a film you'll want to see a second time. At least. Oscars rightly by the handful and nominations are full deserved to combine for a winning performance by all concerned. Definitely in my top fifty of all time. because once you know how the plot goes down, you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time, and enjoying the film even more for them.Why didn't Newman and Redford team up again? Certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in, but as Gondorff would have put it, only chumps don't quit when they're ahead. outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10. also forget another co-star in this film, the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era, scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president. Strange, but it actually works.The Sting still works wonders today. on art direction, brilliant supporting roles (most notably Robert Shaw, ya falla?), and the guiding hand of Redford/Newman chemistry make this one of the Hollywood's great films.  ""The Sting"" is a hallmark of the ""Golden Age"" of American film, and has molded not only countless films, but numerous genres, few of which have met the challenge of its master. "	8.3	1
Harold and Maude (1971)	"and obsessed with death, and an elderly person who is nearing death but is obsessed with life. What is revealed with this strange juxtaposition is that we can only learn to live life to its fullest by following the lessons of the dying. The message that I have taken from Harold and Maude is to live like you were dying! a happy man. This is definitely one of the films that (along with say, Fight Club, American Beauty and The Rocky Horror Picture Show) show you can be who you want to be, and you needn't let anyone oppress you. It's brilliant. Everyone should know a Maude. It has inspired me to buy a banjo and play Cat Stevens songs. and romance, making this in my opinion the most romantic film of all time. HAROLD AND MAUDE is also told very realistically, making the story unfold gracefully and the twist ending is both poignant and reassuring.HAROLD AND MAUDE is certainly one of the funniest movies of all time, but is also one of the most important human stories as well. story are unforgettable and the soundtrack with Cat Steven's songs is another plus. Unfortunately ""Harold and Maude"" has been forgotten in Brazil by the distributors and neither the VHS nor the DVD has been released in my country; I just have a tape recorded from the cable TV. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ensina-me a Viver"" (""Teach me to Live"") Cort has not starred in more things since this movie.  Oh well. This is a good Hal Ashby movie to start with, but if you get a chance you should watch as many as possible.  They are quirky, thoughtful and wonderful. ""Harold and Maude"" is a paean to life and love, even if it's in the weirdest places. "	8.0	1
Trust (1990)	of growth and awakening in a world that often does not present itself as being conducive to growth. The dialog is pure Hartley (if you are unfamiliar with his films I would recommend this as a good place to start). Halfway between John Hughes and Samuel Beckett. The actors portray their awakenings delicately and with precision. Please see this film! as any movie ever has in my life. Do a friend a favor, turn em on to this one, but don't tell them ANYTHING about it beforehand(need that really be said?), let em experience it for themselves. My next goal is to own this movie in some form or another one day. It'll be a welcome addition to my collection. Donovan truly does an outstanding portrait of Matthew, and perfectly manages to forge his paradoxal feelings of extreme anger and vulnerability into a fully working unit.A deeply moving story of two scarred, somewhat maladjusted souls manage to find each other, told in a low-key mood that doesn't get to you immediately. But eventually it does, and when it does...you're hooked.8/10 of the whacked out but fully human characters, Martin Donovan and Adrienne Shelly so young and beautiful. As the final, simple, beautiful, frame of the film disappeared and credits rolled I was left sitting on the couch in a state of shocked amazement at the effect this film still has on me. Hands down my favorite movie of all time! that more people don't know about this movie. It has a great story, brilliant acting and it's really funny.  This is like the best Inde movie ever.  But just see it for yourself and if you like it tell someone about it, because although it is a small film, it is great American art and should be recognized. 	7.5	1
Seventh Seal, The (Sjunde inseglet, Det) (1957)	Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.A masterpiece! quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.THE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema.  It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art.  More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn't just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks. you're not in the mood for soul searching), but one thing is for certain, an allegory on life and death is shown perfectly in the second to last shot of the reaper and his minions following in a dance across the field.  This is one of the most pure of cinema's masterpieces and certainly Bergman's best cine.  A++ link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.  I rate this one 10/10. side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time. Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on the screen. Not to be missed. 	8.2	1
Local Hero (1983)	who have seen it (or recall having seen it). The best recommendation I can make for this film is, when I find the world closing in on me, I watch Local Hero. I smile. I laugh. I even cry a bit. But most importantly, I come away knowing that I might someday find that very possible magic in my life. place where he belongs. The memorable scenes are countless:  the aurora borealis show, the eccentric beachcomber who offers to sell for a dollar per grain of sand in his hand, the injured rabbit, Riegert proposes to trade places with Gordon, etc., etc., etc. Mark Knofler's music is worth the price of admission alone. Definitely one of my all-time favorites. match perfectly the breath-taking scenary that the director, Bill Forsyth, has captured of the Scottish Highlands. Overall, I would have no hesitation in recommending this film to people. Every recommendation I've made has been met with the same response: a gem of a movie that simply cannot be ignored. Local Hero will be my own personal number one for ever!10/10 characters.I can understand why Forsyth didn't develop into a major moviemaker in Hollywood, in the same way that I can understand why some people find this movie boring.  But somehow, to me, keeping this movie alive along with all its' other fans is part of a cockeyed optimism about people that, these days, seems to be very much against-the-grain. a movie or thought that a big budget, lots of pyrotechnics and loads of special effects could cover up a movie's shortcomings - see this film. It should be required at all film schools as an example of what can be accomplished on a little budget but with good ideas and lots of talent. A perfect 10 - times 2! 	7.5	1
Terminator, The (1984)	not the special effects. T3 and T4 are especially over shadowed by the excellence of TSCCI have never gone out of my way like this to defend, of all things, a TV show for heaven's sake but, this show richly deserves the legions of fans it has created.If this show goes away, we may never see TV this good again. BS.......Anyways, Fox has since canceled the show in favor of Dollhouse, WTF? I look at that news like this, Fox are a group of complete idiots when it comes to TV anymore but...at least the show had a chance and lasted two seasons, most shows don't even get that..... Bravo Fox for killing another show and angering millions of fans. on to run for 7 seasons (and also spin-off Angel) - no doubt lining some executives pockets rather nicely.TSCC is another one of those shows that has struck a chord with it's viewers and developed a loyal fan base which continues to grow as more and more people discover it.One can only hope those smart executives are still out there. played by Garret Dillahunt is an excellent actor (you probably seen him in Last House on the Left). Important: The season finale of the second season was probably one of the best season finales I have ever seen in any TV show. It's definitely worth every penny, I really think you will be entertained, especially if you loved Terminator films. the universe even further in Season 2. The first season (which was tragically cut short by the writers' strike) showed a lot of promise and will hopefully only get better as the series continues. If you are willing to accept the fact that this is a different animal to the movies, you should be able to sit back and enjoy. 	7.7	1
Glory (1989)	"of South Carolina, these shots don't emotionally engage the viewer. Still, in the end, ""Glory"" isn't about big, noisy battles.

It's about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.""Glory"" is, indeed, glorious. own weight and leaving audiences more turned off about history. Glory brings the issues of the time - slavery, freedom and sacrifice - down to human scale. We can understand why the men of the 54th were willing to take up arms, and how tragic it was that they had to sacrifice their lives in order to be considered men. You will almost feel like a new person.All of this paired with a beautiful score by James Horner, Glory is simply one of the best war movies of all-time. Anyone who misses this film is missing out one of the most powerful, moving, and memorable experiences a movie can bring you.I'm so glad I found myself in history this year. Broderick completely surprised me with his performance, as well as Cary Elwes. And one cannot forget the likes of Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman giving great performances as soldiers weary of being the Union's lackeys. While the historical accuracy may not be perfect, as least this was a tribute to those who helped emancipate the slaves during the Civil War. mention Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washingtion, Andre Braugher, Cary Elwes, and Jihmi Kennedy. The characters of this film are wonderfully well-developed and the relationships between these men adds a dimension that is rarely seen in modern films. Each performance is Oscar-calibur, overall, this is a film that should now be ranked as a classic for all time. Simply amazing. "	7.9	1
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1990)	destiny. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's fate is already determined before the film begins. And although they play an important role in one of the greatest stories ever told, they are completely unaware of their destiny; they are merely victims of circumstance.I should also note that the constant banter between the two characters (specifically in their 'Game of Questions') is pure quality. Dreyfus).  Stoppard felt that the title characters, messengers in the original play, were under represented and so examines their possible perspectives in the tale by way of exploring their destiny and their lack-of-awareness of it.  Stunning and hilarious wordplay with excellent repartee between Oldman and Roth.  Refreshing and creative spin of the tale of Denmark's 'melancholy prince'. But why? R: Exactly! G: Exactly what? R: Exactly why. G: Why what? R: What? G: Why? Why what, exactly?) It's truly sad that this movie doesn't get the recognition that it deserves. See Hamlet... become familiar with the story line... and then see this movie. It is quite worth the effort. I give it a 10 out of 10. trust and that's what matters I think. Dreyfus is supposed to be over the top, and he complies.In the great Hamlet sweepstakes, many recommend seeing Mel Gibson and then Gwyneth Paltrow. I suppose that's a colorful route. But the real sense of what this is all about comes through with more real reward via Branagh and then this clever film. extremely well cast. Gary Oldman is hilarious as sweet, befuddled Rosencrantz. Tim Roth's angry, frustrated Guildenstern is the perfect complement. They make a great team.Stoppard's film has a sprightly step even when raising a few cosmic questions. It's the perfect tonic for some of the more pompous cinematic takes on Shakespeare, and even the Bard would appreciate its sparkling wordplay. 	7.5	1
Manhattan (1979)	nothing to dispel the popular rumour that New Yorkers are neurotic, self-obsessed and self-indulgent  at least that narrow social circle Allen so often writes about. If you don't mind that, though (and I'm English, so what do I care) you're in for a treat. As with the city itself, the memories of this film will stay with you forever. both senses) black and white photography floats across the screen.And finally underlying everything is the music of George Gershwin, whose exubertant melodies propel the movie forward at every turn.This is Woody Allen's best movie, a great movie, and an American movie in the best sense.  As an homage to the city of New York it will surely remain unsurpassed. style, however, the films are quite dissimilar. Unlike the highly-energetic 'Annie Hall'  which cut back and forward in time, visited old memories, broke the fourth wall and made conversations with passing extras  'Manhattan' boasts a more classical approach  quiet, softly-spoken and accompanied by a wistfully slow jazzy soundtrack, also relying heavily on the works of George Gershwin. done with a good reason, gives a little extra to the movie. Like I said Streep is terrific and so are Allen, Keaton and especially Hemingway (she was nominated for an Oscar). The monologues Allen had in 'Annie Hall' are still present, smart, interesting and funny. A great story, very intelligent, of course written (and directed) by Woody Allen himself. by the sleek cinematographic style of the movie. This movie is Woody Allen's valentine to the city he has such a symbiotic relationship with, and nowhere have I seen New York filmed as artistically as here. Mariel Hemmingway and Diane Keaton  give inspired performances around Woody's perfectly played character resulting in what can only be considered a modern masterpiece. 	8.0	1
Miller's Crossing (1990)	"of Film Noir, it has no equals (""The Usual Suspects"" would rate a close second).  Among gangster films, only ""The Godfather"" can compete, and ""Miller's Crossing"" features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks ""The Godfather's"" epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Touch of Evil"", the belated accolades it so richly deserves. ""Tom."" What has he sacrificed? Has he damned himself?Spectacular action sequences, beautiful production values, top-notch camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld, a haunting musical score, and the best dialogue ever written by the Coen brothers make this a great gangster film. The fascinating and complex theme of friendship, character, and ethics make it one of the great films from any genre. the very beginning on ethics and Tuturro's desperate pleas at Miller's Crossing are both powerful scenes, and Freeman commands the screen whenever he is on.My rating is a 10/10. The best part about this movie is that it gets better and better every time you watch it. Oh yeah...the Danny Boy scene is reason enough to watch this movie anyway. bit histrionic for my taste, but this is his style of acting, suited for the role of the crook, mean and coward, but cunning and dangerous as a snake.To summarize, in ""Miller's Crossing"" fun, drama, action, suspense, mystery are masterly blended with deeper themes such as love, friendship and human loneliness. This movie is splendid, magnificent, unique, don't miss it. through a hallway lined with goons. The third is the police raid on the Sons of Erin Club, in which Leo takes on the entire police force.I'll resist the temptation to call Miller's Crossing ""The Greatest Film of All Time""--because who has the right to say that? But I must say that it is my favorite film of all time. "	7.8	1

I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!! movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary. alone.This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever. teacher to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries may be.

Graduate, The (1967)	"that you are also part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate what we will be watching more and more.What a shame.... Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute. time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.It is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time. It has been a long-time favourite of mine, and I can scarcely imagine growing tired of it. age conscious Hollywood, but also to play so much against ""type."" The music, the clothes, the houses all harken back to when America was discovering not every one lived like Ozzie and Harriet, and that a stiff martini could certainly loosen ones morals. The sexual energy this movie projects oozes across the screen and makes one feel like a voyeur. perfectly right for the story. The Graduate is groundbreaking in more areas than the photography. The casting, writing, acting, picture and sound editing are all exceptionally good, and have influenced film-making ever since. I was very happy when I saw that The Graduate reached the 7th position in the American Film Institute's voting of the best American films in history. "	8.0	1
Touch of Evil (1958)	"about the popular conceptions of the U.S. versus Mexico (made more complex by the fact that Quinlan spends just as much time south of the border and Vargas seems to spend a lot of time north). But as for being annoyed, you're more likely to become infuriated with Quinlan, who becomes more and more deliciously despicable as the film unfolds. a cat and the intelligence of a fox has been reduced to an insignificant mass of tissue, who's ""instinct"" is having a knack for finding evidence that he himself has planted. And while he may be revered by the local officials in law enforcement, he's acutely aware that he is a fraud and petrified that Vargas, has seen him naked. an actor.  His powerful vision drives the film, from the single-cut opening sequence to the cat-and-mouse finale.I suggest watching the 1998 restored version over the original theatrical release, but regardless of which version, ""Touch of Evil"" will have you stuck in your seat, questioning your views of morality until long after the last credit has rolled up the screen. afraid you'll just have to watch the film with your eyes and your mind open instead of shut to ""get it"". Pay attention to what's on the screen instead of the smart, cynical, hip comments you can make about an actual work of heart.Well, what the hell. Joan Didion said it best. Film criticism is petit point on kleenex.Raoul Duke tries hard but ends up looking too much like a documentary. I don't think that directors today use this medium enough, too many rely on colour and the efffects that can only work in colour to get them out of trouble.

You'll want to watch it again and again. from a hard- nosed hysterical animal to a real lady. It's also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a ""cleaner,"" a role he made famous four years later in ""Leon: The Professional."" The DVD provides either easy-to-read subtitles or a well-done dubbed version. If sound is important to you, you'll hear better stereo with the subtitled version. it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile? (Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over, when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau's enigmatic character.) Otherwise, a must-see, and one of Besson's best films. Nikita does not have the feel of an action film, but rather, feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak, and spiced with just a tad of hope. Parillaud's multi-layered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film. "	7.4	0

It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none. 	8.2	1
Chinatown (1974)	"stood up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great, with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script.

Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme (water). None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together. Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos (Burt Young as a driver, Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene), and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making, and arguably one of the greatest in the crime/mystery genre. knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why. From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay, this is a cinema treasure. gets involved with Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the murdered man who appears to want to get to the bottom of the mystery but during the course of the movie demonstrates that she is not telling the whole story and has something to hide.Everything in this movie works from already mentioned tight editing down to the costumes and sets.Nuff said!10/10 "	8.2	1
Day the Earth Stood Still, The (1951)	her. All in all, another flop of a remake. This actually makes the War of the Worlds remake shine.I saw this movie in IMAX - if you're going to see it, find an IMAX theater. Lastly, am I the only sick of seeing the same old New York back drop? I love New York City, but come on! Be original! where mostly everyone will leave feeling under-stimulated. It has its fair share of compelling and visionary moments, but a distinct lack of development, coherency and substance stops The Day the Earth Stood Still from being one worth remembering. Light sci-fi with a dash of social intrigue that mildly entertains, but never reaches its potential.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net) It's so stupid, it's laughable. I was reminded of Ed Wood's horrible sci-fi stories in the 1950s.I will say some of the special-effects and the surround sound in here is excellent. It was the highlight of the movie. These are good visuals and good audio, and a nice film to view on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the story got in the way. some claim it to be. I was therefore ready to accept a remake and the few new ideas offered by the 2008 movie made me painfully aware that a remake could indeed have been interesting, had it been put in better hands or, if I dare say so, in much better hands. So, to me, it's another sadly missed opportunity. root of our environmental problems. Yet, here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence. For that reason alone, I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless (and hapless) films of the year. We're essentially doomed so I say you can take it, Klaatu. Earth is all yours. We clearly don't deserve it. 	5.5	0

It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties... depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watching--we start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.A magnificent film--one of the few great screen tragedies. whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do. Mexican character actor Alfonso Bedoya of course steals all the scenes he appears in and delivers his classic ""Stinking Badges"" line. (what person would dress up as a Bandito for a costume party and not want to look exactly like Bedoya's Gold Hat character?) This film probably should have been a little higher on AFI's top 100. A must see! scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I can't dismiss the similarities (to me anyway).The plot was an interesting one, one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching. I really enjoyed `The Treasure Of Sierra Madre' certainly a must see' film...highly recommended. "	8.3	1
Bad Taste (1987)	it was a demented, gruesome, funny film, so maybe the teen crowd is the right one for Jackson's brain-eating, vomit-spewing, chuck-up-a-thon, or maybe it's also for twenty-somethings after a night on the lash. Either way, Bad Taste should be seen as an example that if you want to make a movie and know how - there is usually a way the boys take on extra-terrestrial buggers who've come to Earth in search of meat.  The plot is also a little hard to follow the first time around. After watching Bad Taste many times however, I have no idea how he was chosen to direct the Lord of the Rings (which rocked).  So, Peter Jackson, for that...I salute you. budget over a period of four years,using second hand equipment,and produced by and starring all Jackson's friends and work colleagues.The amount of bloodshed in this film is really high,but the gore is presented in such a way that it just makes you laugh hysterically.There's vomit eating,brain eating,exploding heads,flying guts and even exploding sheep.A must see for horror,splatter and gore fans! but again, it doesn't in any way detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. All in all, if you're a fan of gore movies, alien romps, or just good ol' fashioned black comedy, then you don't want to miss BAD TASTE. Just make sure you have the stomach for it, or it might just get torn out and eaten! GET STUCK IN YOUR HEAD!!! The entire film has great pacing, never slowing down for one second! This is also a great film for those, like myself, who want to get into filmmaking. This is one of those few films you never get bored watching, whether it's ten times or a thousand times!!! This is a must have for everybody!!! 	6.7	0
Duck Soup (1933)	"gets in on his share of the gags, which are always dominated by Groucho and Chico (my personal favorite).Fantastic dialog makes this version one of the best of them all. There are just tons of funny (and, yes, very dated) lines in this movie and having Duck Soup out on DVD making the sound clearer helps, too. Lots of laughs. time was the satire of society, manners, government, the military, the bureaucracy (including Roberts Rules of Order). I can't recall any other comedy I've seen that satirizes on such a grand scale.For Marx Brothers fans this is a must see.

The Brothers simply deflate the pomposity of the whole deal.4) The fact that Zeppo is actually given something to do.Anybody who thinks the Farrelly brothers are the last word in comedy should be strapped to a chair and shown Marx Bros films over and over again, until they concede. and when you add in the entertaining musical sequences (which again are particularly good in this one), it is a feast that never stops.Any Marx brothers fan has seen this one several times, and does not need to be reminded what great fun it is.  If you have never watched one of their films, give this one a try. playing the straight part against Groucho's antics.

Highly, highly recommended. - Paul seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done. The Shining is a sublime, hauntingly intriguing and endlessly watchable film that shows Kubrick at his best. that her husband is a madman.

That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast. my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10 of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.

Stand by Me (1986)	"yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, ""a great time""I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough.

Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting. close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film.

There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all. Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King.

He perspires with momentum and rapture. This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer. Isn't this what movies are supposed to do? superficial and a waste of time to continuously state. M, as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved. This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us. of invoking our incredulous sympathy... 'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight... through torture, ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless, out of this comes a towering performance of a small, wild-eyed criminal in the midst of an extremely well-told and unpredictable mystery story. In short, if you don't know what you're in for when you hear that whistle, those several infamous notes, you may not at all. "	8.3	1

Sadly, we'll never know. to turn themselves in or face freezing to death in the outside.How much that cold weather influenced what happened, and a number of other facts, such as why 50 people were killed (orders from Hitler) make this a decent documentary. It's nice to know, too, that much of the movie is not made up, as so often happens in films. the atrocities committed during that time.While the Great Escape was brave, daring and heroic for those involved, it just may not have been worth it as this documentary sheds light on the facts and doesn't glorify the events as the much-celebrated film does. If there was ever a Great Escape remake, this is the story to tell. The true story. from the interrogation of the German soldiers who shot the escapees.

Deer Hunter, The (1978)	"will break your heart, it certainly broke mine and Christopher Walken is absolutely riveting. How strange to tho think that Michael Cimino, still a young man, is nowhere to be seen. Is still a punishment for ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Indecent Exposure"" or there is something else we don't know about. The Cimino behind ""The Deer Hunter"" is a true master. (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I've seen; it makes the end of ""Reservoir Dogs"" seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting. A unique classic...it is not surprising that Cimino didn't have another movie in him after something this wrenching. devastated characters of the three who went to war (and the relatively unaffected personalities of those who stayed behind, like Stanley).The strong points of the film are the outstanding performances of nearly every actor in the movie. Yes, there are technical deficiencies in the sound, but it hardly matters. This is nitpicking compared to the overall construction of the film. My willingness to try older films, any films, was because of this picture. Movies are like these are why film lovers should really give older movies a shot. I suggest the AFI's top 100 films as a starting point. The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema that explores the human condition in a way few films do today. edge to it. Immense performances from all concerned, and if i had to say, i believe i have not seen Christopher Walken in a better role. One of the very few films i deservedly give 10/10.

But even today, you should see it just because it's a great movie. have an odd relationship with the singer in question (Wilhelmenia Fernandez), as well as a strange art student cum shoplifter (Thuy An Luu). Nothing is straightforward in 'Diva' but it is consistently watchable. Keep an eye out for Jean-Pierre Jeunet regular Dominique Pinot as a cool looking punk thug, and also the outstanding motorcycle sequence. A very good movie. Recommended. to mention a certain shoplifting technique, or the coolest chase which started in the streets of Paris and ended in the subway's car. The most fascinating thing for me is that Diva was released about twenty years ago in Moscow, I remember the title - but I never saw it back then. Better later than never. Highly recommended - 9/10 - everything is so rundown it's gorgeous. The music perfectly matches the whole film. The performances are not ""realistic"", but they are not meant to be.This is obviously not a piece of cinema verite and shouldn't be reviewed as such.

Unforgiven (1992)	"his head.One of the greatest Westerns ever made?  Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary.  In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man.  Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style. it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.Rather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud. is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"", and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an ""anti-Western"", I think that with this movie, Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. ""Unforgiven"" is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 10/10 so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren't capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism. knows this genre so well, having been its sole flag bearer for practically 25 years, and learning from his peers, Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark, an incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema. 10/10 "	8.2	1
Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)	"and poorly written plot twists changing and damaging the dramatic resolution. This version is inferior in almost every level (the only exception is the acting). It is less powerful, less edgy, and less intelligent.Fortunately for Demme the original picture is not as well known as classics like 'Casablanca' and this will allow his film to find a moderate positive acceptance.  There are some loopholes in the current film's plot, and I do love the cinematic style of the original film more than this one. But as I was only a kid when the first film came out, this film has a slightly stronger emotional impression on me than the other one. I only hope all it stays science fiction! a bit too much fun on camera with someone she finds quite attractive -- don't we all? -- in real life.On its own, the 2004 remake is fine cinema. But the problem with all remakes is the inevitable comparison with original. And sadly, as much as I like the 2004 version, my vote goes with Angie Lansbury and Laurence Harvey. of President Kennedy , directed John Frankenheimer a producer for its realization, appeared excited Frank Sinatra with a script of ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" which could have a role as an officer of the bunch of prisoners Americans, Sinatra was formed as co-producer and introduced the idea before the president of ""United Artists"" , this film was rereleased theatrically in 1987. Demme and his writers cop out with a pointless and weak denouement. That gunshot you hear is Demme shooting himself in the foot.It's almost as if they gave in to appease some mindless preview audience or dimwitted studio hack. Or, maybe they envisioned it just like this. Given my admiration of Demme, I'd like to think otherwise. Hope I'm right. "	6.6	0
Pump Up the Volume (1990)	"Green also makes an appearance that I am sure he would rather forget, his acting is fine it's how he looks thats the problem !!This film is dark, funny and brutaly honest. If you are under 20 and still hate the world this will kill a couple of those boring 'too old to play to young to drink' hours.Highly recommended. message remains the same and I think that's what has made this movie stand the test of time.  Along with ""Heathers"", this is some of Christian Slater's best work ever.  His performance alone is enough to reccommend this one, but that combined with the message, make it a cult classic.  They don't make movies like this anymore. pirate radio station as an anonymous student at the high school, and shares his feelings about the school, he gains a large following of students who feel the same way he does, but then trouble starts. This is a truly great film, with great performances, this is probably the ""Rebel Without A Cause"", for our generation. ***1/2 out of ****. hormones prevents most from truly enjoying the experience.I want every teenager to watch this film, I want every person who looks back on their teen years with regret to watch this film, I want every person who's forgotten what its like to be a teenager to watch this film. I think there's room in just about everyone's heart for it. fact she shows a bit of flesh makes the movie highly genuine, yes girls do get naked with boys whilst at high school.

If you happen not to have seen this before, stick with it for the first few minutes, until you arrive at the home of Cary Grant's two aunts, and then things will take off quickly.If you enjoy morbid humor, ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is an absolute must-see. innocent guilt and laughable situations, other movies like What's Up Doc, Marvin's Room, and even Lake Placid (with its moments of ignorance and bliss) have all stolen moments of Arsenic and Old Lace. No one but Cary Grant could have starred in this movie. A delightful performance and an over the top comedic talent was showcased in this comedy classic. but there are so many beautifully crafted, hilarious moments that I can't rate this movie as anything less than a must-see!  I would go on and on about which scenes I found memorable, but I don't wanna spoil it for anyone.  Just see it for yourself!  Trust me, you'll die laughing!My score:  9 (out of 10) self-referential one where Mortimer (a theater critic)is describing ""bad plays (and movies)"". If you watch the background action, and pay attention to the dialog, the ironic situation is brilliantly realized. This film also has my personal favorite quote, said by Cary Grant as Peter Lorre frantically tries to warn him of impending doom; ""Stop underplaying - I can't hear you!"" the homicidal brother, Peter Lorre as his sidekick, and Jack Carson as the dense police officer truly stand out. They and the others play parts that seem tailor made for them.Over fifty years later, Arsenic and Old Lace will still fracture the funny bone in you.And I wouldn't bet we've still not seen the last Roosevelt in the White House.

All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! "" may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III. raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics. terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart. more.The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels.

While it is rare that dialogue directly addresses the heart and nature of their relationship, what that is becomes clear quickly and transcends the plot of the story to become the real unifying element in this movie. That neither was recognized (in the conventional way) for their performances is unfortunate (which is an understatement). "	7.7	1

This was the last movie he saw in a theater.  He had served under Patton in WW2 and said that Scott had nailed Patton's character and mannerisms so perfectly that halfway through the opening speech, he expected Scott/Patton to look down and say, ""$@%#$@, Sears, get a haircut - your hair's too &#%#$%@ long!"" good particularly karl Malden who plays general Bradley a calm experienced soldier with no dreams of glory, the perfect foil to the maverick Patton, the combat scenes are well shot and are never more than is necessary to support the narrative,the film rises above being very good to excellence due to  George c Scotts intuitive grasp of the character. a clue, and even if it is completely false, I don't care.  I've never been about writing history papers based on cinema experiences.  All I know for certain is that Patton is a very entertaining and well balanced movie that holds up very well thirty years later, and it's a film that can be admired for its craft. like myself, have Jewish blood, or who were otherwise marked for death by the Nazi state, all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his pivotal role in destroying that state.  And yet, had he been born German, Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side. I'm glad he wasn't.Rating: **** out of ****. "	8.0	1
Down by Law (1986)	Perhaps the epitome of a cult movie, this one goes down like a cool beer on a hot summer evening (and as with all cult movies, it is best seen with an audience that already knows and loves the film).

But I think this film has held up pretty well three decades after its release, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking to explore Jarmusch's work. this to get your complete attention. You could probably speculate a lot about the meaning of the movie; to me, this seems highly unnecessary. Just let it unfold its atmosphere.

But if you can skip over these points and see the overall genius of Akira, you may just appreciate Akira's place on the pantheon of modern culture. think of the film as the pipe dream of one who predicted such tragic events as of September 11.

It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie.All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone.  Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides and judge for yourself.

Egregious just isn't a big enough word to describe it.The sequels are best viewed as being entirely separate from the original. If you haven't already seen them, be prepared for a decidedly tepid experience.But Highlander itself  ah, there's a real movie. Sit back and enjoy! 9.5/10 intentionally muddled structure is slightly irritating on the first viewing, but with repeated viewings it becomes more comprehensible, even clever.

Even the series didn't do that.

Unfortunately, a good idea was taken and flogged to death afterward. film, and sometimes it tends to fall back on genre stereotypes but the overall effect of the film more than makes up for it.

Still, this has to be considered one of the best ""comedy classics"" ever. is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee. The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film.

Ben-Hur (1959)	"(at least to me) the ultimate film epic.

This Is Spinal Tap (1984)	"St Hubbins and Smalls which is even funnier than the movie itself. In fact it's the most entertaining DVD commentary track I've heard to date. This movie is a comedy classic, and easily the sharpest rock'n'roll parody ever made. If you haven't seen it before you're in for a treat! Absolutely essential viewing for all rock'n'roll fans, metal or otherwise! I finally saw the movie.  Every aspect of the music world is lampooned; arrogance, absurdity, backstage crybabies, has-beenism, volume, even the Beatles.  This movie is quoted like the Simpsons, which isn't always good but certainly proof of legendary movie.  It's dry, deadpan humor and it may take a day to sink in but this movie is hilarious. kind of slow down nearer the end with the bands falling apart (i.e., the plot gets in the way of the documentary), but there was never a scene in the film that didn't have something hilarious. I have to give this film 10/10. This Is Spinal Tarp, er, um, I mean Tap is one of the funniest comedies ever made. as well. Directed by Reiner (his debut) with accurate depiction of super-inflated egos, pompous hangers-on and hilarious intimate moments with great dialogue thanks to the improvisations of the trio who reportedly worked from no screenplay. Best moment: Spinal Tap trying to find the stage. And I personally agree with the keyboardist's philosophy of ""Have a good time, all the time"". where the band plays on a Stonehenge stage is a classic, very memorable.Writer Christopher Guest recently wrote and starred in 'Best in Show' (2000) and 'A Mighty Wind' (2003), two hilarious and terrific fake documentaries, the so-called mockumentaries, but 'This is Spinal Tap' stays the classic example. He and his co-writers, including director Reiner, have created the ultimate cult classic. "	8.0	1
Some Kind of Wonderful (1987)	Mary Stuart's character is the most interesting and emotionally sensitive, enough that she'll bring tears to your eyes. This is an excellent film. It came out at a time when there were a lot of teen movies (Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, etc.), but this is a story that never grows old and is a pleasure to watch again. doesn't sound commerical like in other Hughes films. The music really suits every scenes it shows up in (especially the end credits that feature Lick The Tins take on 'Can't Help Falling In Love'). Molly Ringwald reportedly turned down a role in this film, but it's good that she did because I couldn't picture her in this classic. Great film. terrific too- she went on to great TV fame. But the strength of the film is the fine acting. Stoltz has the harder more thankless role, and gives it a depth and charm that are a relief to see, and Masterson all but steals the movie. Together they are John Hughes best couple, even though he didn't direct this film. being sickly sweet.  It delves into family relationships, friendships, and romance.  Most notably, it tackles something that the current teen fair seems to lack, social consciousness.  It's not afraid to break stereotypes or point out social injustice.  Not to mention, it has one of the best soundtracks of the '80s.  I give it an A++!!! since lost touch and I have been looking for him. Guess the first time I seen this movie, I liked it just because it was SUCH a good movie but a few years later seeing it, it really hit me in the face and to this day I always watch it whenever I get the chance and remember my friend... 	7.1	0
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)	"non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment. Brody with as much befuddlement as Connery does his role.  And who can blame him? And the FX: there's so many you lose count.  But don't bother, just sit back, relax and get swept up in the moment.  You can't help yourself but to get into this ""Crusade"".Ten stars.  A classic Ford with a bright Sean. a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have trouble interpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages will enjoy. to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures. They're an absolute blast and if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, please take the first opportunity you have to watch it, it's a great movie.10/10 "	8.3	1

More than that, however, this film is historically fascinating.  Taken as a whole, the movie, the book, the behind the scenes intrigue, the place it holds in the careers of the Stars, the writers and the directors, makes this an exceptionally interesting and enjoyable film. Chauncey's love for TV and the fact that it is his reference point for his existance. (Such has when he tries to click a remote to thwart off muggers). But there is a great deal more to Being There. It is a Top 10 Selection of 70s, Hal Ashby's best film and Peter Sellers greatest performance. **** out of ****. physical comedy that Sellers made was not only timeless but funnier than most of the comedy we see in film today. Second to maybe his role in Lolita and in the Pink Panther series, Sellers is not only funny, but gives his best performance in Being There. A terrific story with interesting and real characters, Being There is a delight. on the apex of the pyramid of ""Rand's"" mausoleum during the funeral scene. Pretty powerful stuff--makes Being There all the more an important and revealing work--as well as spiritual. Like the protagonist, Chauncey Gardner, there's something about this film that makes you feel better about life and , yeah, even about death. Kosinski's, Ashby's and Seller's gift to us all. "	8.0	1

But as a young and unappointed ambassador, I felt it my duty to bow my head in that country which is a microcosm of the whole planet. Thanks to this film, `Gandhi', Attenborough and Kingsley have said just about all there was to say.< For men may come and men may go, but Gandhi goes on forever > the preceding year's Academy Award winner, Chariots of Fire (where he played the Scottish sprinter-missionary, Eric Liddell).This movie won eight Oscars, with Attenborough, Briley, and Kingsley all earning honors.  No other film biography I ever have seen works so well.  It will stand the test of time and inform multiple generations.  One doubts remakes will be necessary. Ben Kingsley! Without a doubt his portrayal of Gandhi is one of the best performances of his career, if not THE best. Playing the pacifist Indian lawyer-turned-leader couldn't have been an easy task, and I don't think anyone could have pulled it off as well as he did. This movie deserves all the praise anyone gives it and more. Excellent. a firm believer in the value of non-violent protest, and have tried my best to apply that philosophy to most situations in my life. It has worked wonders for me, and has really changed how I view the world in terms of human nature and so forth. Like I said, VERY few films can do something like that to me. "	8.1	1
Unbearable Lightness of Being, The (1988)	these people's lives.  This film is deeply erotic but in an intelligent and adult way that puts most other film's treatment of sex to shame.  I thought it was beautifully handled by all concerned, and if I ever want to cry, I only need watch the scenes with the dog and the final scenes, both pulled off superbly. on screen. The young Juliette Binoche is adorable, shy and emotionally powerful but also plays it off very subtly. Lena Olin is overwhelmingly seductive and crafts a sense of freedom unlike any I've ever seen. These characters are all very human which means they have their fair share of flaws and the performances capture every essence of them so perfectly. That is the art of his game. Lena Olin is outstanding. The scene in which she complains about the music is, I feel, a classic.I love this film, and thats what it is, a film. Not a book. This Film seems to tap into something truly moving and touching. Thank you to all the crew involved. A Classic of Cinema. have time to develop. By concentrating on the three central characters, this film blossoms past what the novel ever achieved (although the novel is arguably more historically important). Philip Kaufman and Jean-Claude Carriere also add a couple of beautiful scenes that weren't in the novel, including Tomas' and Teresa's wedding, which is one of the most beautiful scenes in filmdom. a provocative analogy, nothing more.  But as the essay becomes an object of obsession to the Communists, we see Kundera's definition of vertigo come into play.  It is not the fear of falling, but the soul's defense against the desire to fall.  Tomas wanted to fall.  Why?  Watch the movie, and find out for yourself. 	7.4	0

Even the minor characters get their moment in the spotlight, and the plot isn't dumbed down for the audience.  If this isn't what happens at M.I.T. and similar institutes, you wish it did...and that you could sign up.

Had me laughing out loud in many places - rare for a modern version like American Pie. Lots of tasty 80s musical montages scattered throughout. Something really likable and positive about this movie, leaves you feeling really good at the end. Highly recommended - really hasn't dated at all. An enjoyable trip down 80s memory lane! music soundtrack and funny performances. William Atherton is perfect as the self-important, snobby professor, and another highlight is Robert Prescott, who plays his butt-kissing, nerdy assistant ""Kent"".A movie that asks the question, isn't life experience just as important for education, as classrooms and books?  A very funny, fine film that is up there with ""Animal House"" in my opinion. "	7.0	0

The people that have guided and taken care of them while they grew up, often take away their ability to happily and normally function on their own.  And the album and film's lesson is for not only the people who drove him to his wall to back off, but for him to pull himself out. only ahead of its time, but timeless.The Wall is a masterpiece of storytelling, but not in the traditional sense. One must not watch this film expecting everything on a silver platter. Symbolism and metaphors abound, leaving a great deal of interpretation and adaptation to the viewer.

It is brutal, cynical, and disturbing, but it has moments of flesh-tingling beauty and an uplifting message in the end, if you persevere. I recommend both it and the album to anyone who enjoys a powerful movie. In my opinion, ""The Wall,"" along with a few other albums, represents the pinnacle of rock music. beyond even the concept of the bestselling album that this movie is based upon. He has crafted a surreal essay on the madness and self-destruction that lurks within the human spirit.

It is, to itself, true. The cast are great. To this day, despite much, I like Kevin Costner. My sole concern is, why the hell can't I buy ""Shoeless Joe"", the novel upon which it was based and which I read in the late eighties? It contains much more background and is, in itself, an absorbing read. Dave Marshall pick it apart and attempt to show the world my ""field"" of brilliance. All I will say is this is the kind of movie Hollywood should be reeling out more often, a tiny masterpiece that lets others be refreshed in their faith and believe in their crazy little fantasies. Ray Kinsella did, and now, so do I. Rating: Four stars. positive movie.As some reviewers have noticed, some suspension of disbelief is required.A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message.

Some of the details of his life are altered in the movie; cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Graham. he throughout the film makes no sense of what it he is looking for.

This film features perhaps the greatest ending to a movie ever made. You will never forget it, and you will wish that you had a friendship as strong as these two individuals. their love and respect for each other transcends their faults, even their lives, putting the film's final scene, as a physically crushed Carnehan leaves his 'bundle' for Kipling, into perspective.

I praise this movie, 10/10 of all he let Robert Redford and Paul Newman do their thing.

They are just so many laughs, many fun action scenes and of course Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Sundance Kid' was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were other attempts or experiments made like this but I don't think that they succeeded.

The only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses. dramatic closers to scenes (e.g. ""We are dealing with a demon!"", then a cut-away to another scene.) Overall, ""Dracula"" is a good film and is worth seeing for its visuals alone. It is not, however, the strongest adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel; given the hype surrounding its release in 1992, the completed effort is rather lackluster in the story department. seamlessly, Coppola has taken his film, not only to the zenith of the horror genre, but beyond.  It's a journey into the regions beyond the known, wherein the forces of darkness thrive and survive; a cinematic experience you'll not soon forget, courtesy of Coppola, a superlative cast, and the magic of the movies.

Mention should also be made of the excellent performance given by Ernest Thesiger as Doctor Pretorious. I've been interested in movies since I was 4 years old and have ""Bride of Frankenstein"" to thank for that. Superb. And who came up with the hair. It is one of those things like the monster's neck bolts, that has become such an icon for our culture. These early Universal films deserve to be judged as major movies. Just because the subject is horror, doesn't mean they should be dismissed. James Whale was a great director with an amazing vision. "	7.9	1

And above all, I LOVE how the movie ends. Although it's predictable, it was VERY welcome. Movies with sad, creepy endings that leave you with a shiver always work for me. creepy Chauffeur driver and the foggy lighting and lens effects really stuck with me. And the last scene was terrifying. I'm much older now but when revisiting this horror classic I'm reminded of that night in the backseat of my parents car...I still get chills. I also had the same experiences with ""Seizure"" ""From Beyond the Grave"" and ""The Sentinel"". you on your toes at the same time. Much better ending than from the original novel. (listen to the commentary with co-writer William F. Nolan)-Burnt Offerings is truly a HORROR CLASSIC. Brace yourself for a creepy ending. Karen Black is stranger than usually. If you like scary old victorian houses with mysterious goings on, Burnt Offerings is just the flick. in other parts. Watching Bette Davis dying was, eh, a bit unsettling. She really looked like she was dying, the poor old woman. Good but not great. I really love the idea of the house ""shedding"" its skin. If you've seen THE SHINING and not this film, watch it, you'll be more shock about the similarities than the movie itself. performance from loving wife and mother, to the caretaker of the ""old lady"". Betty Davis comes off a bit aloof, but that also work well in the story. And the scene with the house ""shedding"", very creepy. Now for the ending. One of the best I have ever seen.

Candyman (1992)	compliment for a truly adult horror movie. No dear, you won't find happy teens in pastel t-shirts having slumber parties and discussing trendy scary movies, while some rap star tries to sell records on the soundtrack. This is a grown up film for grown up people. There is a reason horror films are for adults, and that reason is 'Candyman'. of losing its focus. The music in Candyman adds a mysterious mood that matches the dark, dismal atmosphere of the lone apartments in Cabrini Green.All in all on my horror movie scale, I give Candyman a 10.  To me, it was purely artistic and absolutely enjoyable.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone even slightly interested in horror movies. say it's definitely a film to watch late at night... alone.One of the clever horror films (if not the best) of that disappointing decade they call the '90s for horror films. If you're looking for a serious horror (before Scream's imitators made a mockery of the slasher sub-genre), I highly recommend this provocative slasher that doesn't cop out the audience.  above all  incredibly frightening voice. The legend behind his character is staggering and it's beautiful to see how director Rose plays with the realism and surrealism of Barker's basic idea. Not many horror films of the 90's decade come with my highest possible recommendation, but this one definitely does. And don't forget, the Candyman CAN...rip you to pieces! Todd's acting. The supporting cast particularly Vanessa Williams and even the young kid who Helen interviews while in the neighbourhood-also deserve an honourable mention for giving their characters such a realistic edge.I would recommend this movie it is chilling, frightening, intriguing, compelling, sad and wonderful all in one. One of the best movies I have ever seen in this genre 	6.6	0

Strongly recommended. through your body. This is also one of DeNiro's most underrated performances and deserved more attention at the time of its release. Its also great to see some of the actors from the original version show up in cameo roles. If you like horror films and thrillers, you will most likely enjoy this. ***1/2 out of ****. A recommended viewing. acting standout goes to Joe Don Baker as a hired private investigator.  But make no mistake....this is De Niro's film all the way.  He has some of the best lines as he harasses the Bowden family, terrorizes the Bowden family, and strips the Bowden family of all civility, pretense, and dignity.  This film is definitely a keeper! Sly Stallone's action movies.  I mean that at times it felt like the movie was talking down to the audience. Still, it's an interesting movie in its own right.  Not badly done.  But I wish they'd stop pushing out remakes of classics.  Leave well enough alone because otherwise you're liable to find yourself in Dante's Purgatorio. ""democracy."" When it came out, this movie was reviled by critics, especially by effete yuppies like Terence Rafferty at GQ and VANITY FAIR.

Cape Fear (1962)	know perfectly the man is real mean and deadly. This surely was one of Mitchum's best appearances in his long film carrier.The 1991 Cape Fear version with Robert de Niro -although a watchable movie- is not as good and thrilling as this one where evil doesn't appear clearly till the end but menace is always there.A very good thriller indeed! We don't know: and this uncertainty is worse than any precise knowledge.I doubt I've said enough.  `Cape Fear' is riveting from first frame to last. It's well shot, the acting is excellent, and Bernard Herrmann gives us his usual fitting score.  It appeals to the intellect as much as to the pit of the stomach.  Great stuff. manages to be powerful and thrilling despite the censors and is a really good drama.  However it is totally carried by a monstrous yet subtle performance by Mitchum.  De Niro was good in the role but once you've seen this you'll realise that menace can be acted subtly and not just by sneering and getting tonnes of tattoos. waste time on the elaborate feint towards Peggy instead of pursuing his real victim.  And how can it be that Cady can defeat three ruffians single-handed, overwhelm a police bodyguard with ease, yet fail to defeat Sam, even when armed with a stick?Verdict - Allowing for the improbabilities, this is a well-made thriller with a magnificent performance by Mitchum. police were therefore helpless... But his very presence, the tone of his voice, the look in his eyes as he turned them lazily on Peck's attractive wife and adolescent daughter showed with unmistakable and cumulative menace that he would surely take his revenge... Peck planted his wife and daughter on a safely moored houseboat to tempt Mitchum into a trap... 	7.8	1
Carrie (1976)	"with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmed... Sissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge... Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance... from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for Carrie'  9/10. ""The Devil's Got a Hold Of Your Soul"". Carrie is campy nostalgia. It really is a time capsule of that era in history. The polyester, the gym shorts and knee socks, the afros and farrah-hair just take you back to 1976. Where else can you see the stars of Welcome Back Kotter and Eight Is Enough in the same movie? MGM. Despite a rich premise, the film was an artistic failure.  DePalma had nothing to worry about. The sequel (retread might be a better word) lacks everything that makes DePalma's original so good. Rent or buy the original, on tape (in pan-and-scan or widescreen)and DVD (widescreen)and forget the sequel, even if they give it away.**** out of 4 stars at me. If there was one complaint I had to do about the movie, it's that it took too much time to get to main scene and the prom went on a little too long, but other than that it's a first class horrror/thriller that any horror buff needs to see.My rating: 8/10Rated R for nudity, some language, and blood.

Cat People (1982)	"the top as it leads you to expect, and certainly the film's very literal depiction of fantasy elements will not be to every taste. But if you have a hunger to walk on the wild side, CAT PEOPLE (which is rapidly gaining status as a cult film) will suit your need as guilty pleasure.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer it very well, and I certainly didn't have the visual and overall aesthetic appreciation that I currently have. Now, I think it's a masterpiece--perhaps one of the better films of the 1980s. It's worth checking out at least once, and if you've seen it awhile ago and think you didn't like it so well, it's worth giving a second chance. that soundtrack Giorgio Moroder and Bowie crafted must be one of the strangest in the history of film. Starting off on a campy note, the music over the reddish desert of the first scene ought to make a person either laugh or weep but it does get better.

In spite of an ill-defined supporting cast, Paul Schrader's assured direction, the bizarre script (by ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" star Alan Ormsby), those lush New Orleans locations, and the chemistry between Kinski and McDowell keep ""Cat People"" afloat.

It is rated R bloody disgusting slasher movie ever. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 favorite slasher horror film. number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval hair make their debut in this film as well, and though his character is about half a million miles away from Captain Jack Sparrow, the raw talent is still very much in evidence here. This remains the best movie of the Elm Street series, with a few good sequels and some really crappy ones. But Freddy is always worth watching. extremely scary just for the fact that he's so confident in knowing that he will kill you. He's ruthless, scary, and clever and he's coming to kill the kids in their dreams. A Nightmare on Elm Street is such a great film and I highly recommend it, Wes Craven is an original genius who spawned a new type of terror.10/10 interpretation of the scene, but one that feels like a cop-out. The scene that follows, and where the movie ends, is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsily-made final two scenes come close to ruining the movie, and it is a testament to the film's many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings. 	7.5	1
Nosferatu (Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens) (1922)	"Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of `Nosferatu.'  A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.  This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10. it's difficult to tell the difference without them.My copy is marred with some hilarious inappropriate sound effects (such as a massive ""BOING"" when the gates of the castle open on their own accord) which I've learned not to hold against the film itself.Thank God that Florence Stoker did not manage to completely wipe this film of the face of existence. Schreck's weird character, creating an atmosphere full of constant strangeness, uncertainty, and foreboding.It's unnecessary (and probably impossible) to make detailed comparisons among all the film versions of the Dracula character and legend. ""Nosferatu"" stands perfectly well on its own, as a unique and skillfully done adaptation of the story, and as one of the memorable classics of the silent era. as a subtext to Nazism or anti-Semetism, at it's core, it's simply the tale of a monster, who brings ruin and death in his wake. That such a tale has managed to survive it's era, considering the obstacles that could have totally removed it from view, is the gain of all who have seen. Eat your heart out, Bela Lugosi. of outside forces on a young couple, as well as being one of the key early horrors in its portrayal of Stoker's anti-hero.This version of the Dracula tale remains one of the best, although all have some different perspective on the novel.  On the strength of 'Nosferatu' alone, Murnau deserves his place as a true innovator of silent cinema. "	8.0	1
Omen, The (1976)	The haunted performances of the actors, the creepy-crawly musical score, the insinuation that doom is slowly creeping into the world with the birth of one lone child, all succeed in making THE OMEN one of the truest  horror films. Sometimes it's the knowing that something is going to happen that is more frightening than actually seeing it happen ... and had a memorizing awe as Damien. Although, Peck deserves more credit really, as he brought such devotion to his character that we honestly feel the pain and confusion that hits home.One of the true benchmarks of horror, along the same lines of 'The Exorcist', but for me it beats that film all ends up. Expect a devilishly good time! are, as usual, fantastic. Billie Whitelaw is pretty much flawless as the evil nanny and Harvey Stephens, although he doesn't say much, is very good as little Damien.The last thing that makes the movie scary are some of the most bizarre deaths. The most known of them is a decapitation which is one of the scariest deaths in horror history.5/5. classics of the '70s and often underrated. The sequels to this were simply not memorable and not worth your time. I don't know about the re- make that just came out, but it would be tough to top this film. I think I'll stick with this one and I won't wait another 30 years to see it again. Maybe tonight!! goal is to grow up and take over the world for his unearthly father.

Albino Alligator (1996)	but I especially enjoyed Fichtner's redneck sociopath and Mortensen's mysterious French Canadian who may not be the average joe he appears to be. Both actors have been favourites of mine for some time. 'Albino Alligator' is no masterpiece, but if you want to see some good actors do their thing I suggest you check it out, you won't be disappointed. Gary Sinise, Faye Dunaway, or Viggo Mortenson.The film is also a classic tale of inhumanity, on how far people need to or will go to save their own skin, on choices. It sounds cliché, but the movie doesn't come across that way in the least. Overall, I recommend the film for a lazy Saturday afternoon, like it was for me. loose cannon. Gary Sinise doesn't  have much to do. The ensemble cast is good under Mr. Spacey's  direction. John Spencer, Skeet Ulrich, M Emmet Walsh, Joe Mantegna,  Melinda McGraw and Frankie Faison are effective in their roles.  A film to be seen as a curiosity because it marks Kevin Spacey's film  debut as a director. Dillon, Dunaway, and Sinise.But the movie suggests Spacey should learn about reading scripts next time. The movie harks back to films like PETRIFIED FOREST, but is little more than a clone of them, and writer Christian Forte often falls back on obscenities to substitute for character development and plot.  And some of the scenes strain credulity, like the ending. and immediacy which accents character development and showcases each actor's individual talents.  Beautifully written, directed and acted, it's worth a look, and a look again.  Most notable is the character of Law, portrayed by William Fichtner, whose electric intensity keeps the nerves raw and the eyes riveted.  Kudos to Kevin Spacey for a deliciously original directorial debut. 	6.1	0

She is terrific! As for the actual storyline of the movie, it is somewhat predictable in its final outcome, but the routes it takes along the way are always interesting.

A very delightful romantic comedy! for dating, of looking attractive to men, and of the fact that we face ourselves in the mirror - and so do we face ourselves honestly or lying to ourselves?

However, he is exaggerating, too: which man can act this untruthful and affected?! In the scenes from Streisand's and his marriage his character is almost eerie - may this be good or bad for the movie... more importantly, they learn that in the end, anything truly worthwhile, sometimes you have to take risks for. Unless you are really that jaded, you can not leave this movie by it's end without feeling,(even if just a little),good!

Breaking the Waves (1996)	takes the already-great material to a new level and shows how inspired von Trier is, starts with a moment of sad irony and then leaps to the skies with an image that fills the most atheistic person with questions and the more religiously spiritual people with hope. Here is a film that reaches for the stars and makes it there. serious physical and emotional discomfort. I had rented it, and actually had to stop it at several points and give myself some time to recover before continuing on. I'm not sure it's a film that I'd ever want to see a second time, but I believe it is a true work of art and am grateful to have seen it. camera, lack of artificial lighting, grainy photography, and lingering close-ups can try the patience. The movie is also long, clocking in at about 2½ hours. But if you see it through, the final half hour will blow your mind, and you will have seen one of the best (and most emotionally powerful) movies of 1996, maybe even the whole decade. even a jaded cynic like myself was surprised at how effective its spiritual theme was. To me 'Breaking The Waves' is a much better more than von Trier's better known 'Dancer In The Dark', and Watson's performance makes Bjork's look like that of an enthusiastic but not very talented amateur (which of course, is exactly what she is). Highly recommended. love.This is a love story, but not like one we have seen in a very long time. I don't think we will see anything similar to this again. It will be hard for Hollywood to emulate such raw talent, groundbreaking direction, and life-changing story.

And Brad Dourif is perfectly cast as the creepy duty doctor, his knowing performance raises a smile.The film has enough to keep you watching to its conclusion but will leave you disappointed at not being able to fully deliver on what could've been a very affecting thriller. Brad Dourif playing a weird autopsy doctor, the other is the uncredited John C. Reilly, who is still one of the most underrated great actors in my opinion! All in all director Ole Bornedal has made a well done remake, which is probably no revolutionary film , but in comparison to Gus Van Sant´s awful ""Psycho""-rip off a real masterpiece!!! and some light touches of humour. The look on McGregor's face, when his buddy scares him nearly to death in the morgue is priceless. Despite all it's flaws, this is worth a look.

""Nightwatch"" is a watchable horror/suspense movie but it's hard to take seriously at all due it it's very predictable and unconvincing story and the killer is so obvious that you can easily spot him well before the movie reveals his true identity. this is the first film in a LONG time that, well it scared the crap out of me. Amazingly written, cast, and filmed, I felt it achieved an ingenious atmosphere similar to that in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which is imperative to the effect of a good suspense/thriller/horror film.

The ending turned me off a bit with the overt plug for astrology, but is a happy one for all parties and at least leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.In all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography. Maybe because I have grown more of an appreciation for classical music in that timeframe. I really don't understand how I could have missed the outstanding portrayal of the nuturing/stultifying father-son relationship, or the moving way that David can only express himself via the piano (notice how he speaks in virtually only apothems).

Nevertheless, it's enjoyable and doesn't deserve any harsh comments.Note: Because of the abundance of Christmas-related content, it's best to watch this around Christmas time, or you may feel slightly embarrassed.*** out of **** (especially her mother) were also very enjoyable. Sometimes I just need a break from the mayhem and violence and this is a sweet, uplifting, old-fashioned Christmas pleasure I try to watch every year. If you like Denzel, if you like Lionel Ritchie, if you like Gregory Hines, and especially if you like gospel music, please give this movie a try. by thoughtless people who should know better, he pulls off some great moments in the story. Unusually too the children are well cast, not too sugary or given scene stealing lines, they complement the adults rather than displace or ridicule them. This is a specialist type of film, a romantic, unrealistic dreamy story, and must be judged in that light. of David and the Lion, which captivates the Bishop's entire household, down to the all-business secretary (not to mention the audience!). In TPW, we are made to be moved by the beautiful music; and as such, I guess we might as well just buy the soundtrack. TBW reminded me that special effects are only as good as the movie itself. deliver through this tired direction and uninspired script.  Nothing really works in the movie (unless, perhaps, you never saw the original),  the Preacher is not sympathetic enough, Whitney isn't at full strength as the title character, and even Gregory Hines can't seem to make the villain seem like much of a baddie.A thorough waste of time and celluloid! 	5.5	0
Ridicule (1996)	"Obviously, the movie doesn't lack ironical humor: when the king asks to a courtier: ""I hope it's not a pun"" and the courtier replies: ""no, Sir, it's a play on words"". Play on words and pun mean the same thing.At the end, a brilliant movie rightly awarded in France where it won the Oscar for the Best movie in 1997 is usually not the case) are excellent, inventive and faithful enough, while comfortably brief, to have been done by a professional translator instead of by someone handy who is passably bilingual.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!) not to want to bed Ardant, and even more a fool to trust her. The love affair between Berling and his deep-diving sweetheart is amusing and endearing.The film is sumptuously mounted. The dialogue is so clever a knowledge of French might be in order, but the English subtitles do a superb job of conveying the witty, cruel, self-serving word play. Sometimes I hoped that I could see the lives of the other people in the plot, like that little deaf/mute boy, Paul or whatever happened to the abbot? Overall, I must say that the film is beautifully shot, funny in a very literary, upper minded way and a sheer delight. Not for those with a taste for low-brow humor however. one, or Beaumarchais l'insolent, Marquise, or Cyrano de Bergerac.  By the way, I'd like to tell Thefan-2 of Detroit that the Ridicule of the title don't mean Ridiculous. In the Renaissance French language, it means Hard. And that's what is facing Berling, when he wants to get in touch the king to help the poor people of his land. "	7.5	1
Crucible, The (1996)	"end (won't give that away here).It wasn't just the awesome acting that won me over, but the authentic Old English dialog, the somewhat grainy cinematography (which provided an uneasy feeling in viewing the town of Salem), and wonderful sets and costumes that really made this a classic for me, and my all-time favorite movie. Highly recommend it! A perfect 10/10! Allen leaves an indelible impression of marvellous acting. I was in tears in the scene where she and John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) fall in love all over again. I sincerely hope that The Crucible will be shown in schools/colleges in years to come, to remind us of the horror that occurred in 17th century Salem. A work of cinematic genius. they may be endangered.An excellent cast does the play justice.Daniel Day-Lewis gives a powerful performance (I say God is dead!)that few of his peers can equal.Wynona Ryder is efficient in her ambiguous part.Joan Allen gives a subdued but moving interpretation.Paul Scoffield personifies the inhuman law with authority.Bruce Davison (""Willard""'s hero ,1971).All in all, a magnificent show ,thanks to all concerned. take what we can from the material without too much flair in the way. Overall this is a fantastic version of the play  it is intelligent, well acted and very moving and involving.  It may have the occasional weak link but those are pretty minor.  Anyone with a passing interest in very good films should watch this. of those who invent it; the same cause as the `reds under the beds' phobia of the 1960s and 1970s, today transformed into `Islam Terror' around every corner. The clothing is different, but the mentality producing the phobias is not. `The Crucible' in this excellent adaptation make this poignantly clear. My vote is slightly higher than the present IMDb average. "	6.8	0
101 Dalmatians (1996)	"delightfully over the top, with more ham than a bacon butty. If you liked the cartoon you'll love this version as well. The only thing I wondered about in the whole film was how many takes it took them to get some of the animal shots,  this certainly contradicts the old adage of not working with animals and kids.  Bless her.This isn't the kind of movie that can be successfully analyzed.  You either like it or not, depending on what kind of tolerance you have for kiddie slapstick.  I like that, so I liked ""101 Dalmatians"".Seven stars, plus half a star for Close's diabolical work...and a half star more for the donations from the animal world. excellently employed. Virtually seamless integration of live action and computer animation. And also, the hosts of animals (live and animated) in the film do NOT talk (a cloying and sentimental habit too often indulged in by Disney Studios et al).The film is an adult's movie that children should also enjoy! The VHS version was good, the DVD version even better. it all together is the casting. The characters were brought to life in a totally believeable way--from Jeff Daniels as the Dalmatian-loving, Cruella-hating Roger Dearly, to Ms.DeVil herself, played to perfection by the unbeatable Glenn Close. All of the actors fill the shoes of their characters, the comic timing is just right, and everything about it spells a Disney masterpiece. Shrapnel who is perhaps best known for his role in ""Gladiator"".The fun and perhaps also a bit underrated musical score is done by Michael Kamen.

I Can't Sleep (J'ai pas sommeil) (1994)	"crime portrayed according to the usual formula, this film can be confusing at first glance.

It abandons the sensationalism created by the media to bring us face to face with a real situation. bear false witness""). One can't explain why it seems right, but everyting certainly does feel just right - the film is conjured from single notes that together comprise a whole score. There is what seems like extraneous stuff in there. You wonder how it fits, what it really means. Yet, it nevertheless feels right once the whole has been digested. for sexual predators. Exploitation of these immigrants continue as it was in colonial times, except this time is not so overt. The illusion of freedom is thin. The impossibility of communication thick. Interacial affairs doomed, as are their children. Pretty bleak, but portrayed with sensitivity by Denis who shows us the underside and post effects of colonialism in contemporary Paris. on, and in fact, there are a couple of coldly frightening scenes of calculated murder. I found myself not being attracted to nor empathizing with any of these characters. I merely observed with some interest. The general viewer response will depend on personal preferences. All in all, I found this ultimately to be a very slightly above average film work. of people.  Although a serial killer is loose in Paris, this film is not a classic thriller, in the sense that the viewer does not feel on-edge, and actually might feel comfortable with the killer as did I.  I would recommend this film as a good peek at what it is like to be an outsider in Paris. "	7.0	0

This is truly Willis and director Renny Harlin at their best. more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2 (appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of the genre. like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!Rating: 4/5 or 9/10 series.  It helps (but not enough) that the character realizes he's basically in a sequel.  There are some minor variations in the formula, but basically the movie relies on the Bruce Willis' charisma and humor, and elaborate action sequences.  William Sadler is okay, but no Alan Rickman (or Jeremy Irons in #3).  It's still enjoyable, though. 	7.1	0
Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)	"learn to appreciate the unique attributes that make us human ...

Definitely see it if you are truly interested in taking a philosophical journey into the essence of what makes us human. mother ship (ID4)when Will Smith is making his escape run). All in all, the ingredients of good character development, believable conflict, and hard science make this movie the true precursor to Star Trek: The Next Generation. Unfortunately, Star Treks III, IV, and V avoid the hard work this movie required and depend on the silly antics of its maturing crew. limitations, the demands of the studio, and the many demands of the Star Trek Bible that qualified the creation of the movie. I am pleased to see that other reviewers here have come to appreicate this movie many years later. I encourage the skeptics to find the time to relax and watch it on the biggest screen you can find. Picture received three Academy Award nominations, for Best Art&Set Direction, Best Visual Effects, and Best Musical Score. The special effects never overwhelm the telling of a good story which is the primary mission and best asset of the original television series and its successors. If you're not a Trekkie before seeing this film, you may be come one upon viewing. battles.UPDATE: I recently watched the Director's Edition DVD. The sound effects are fixed, and the film has been re-edited to tighten the pace ever so slightly. The changes made are not on the level of the Star Wars special editions, but they do make the movie more watchable. It's a little more coherent now, and I like it even more. "	6.4	0
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)	"loathsome presence. I would rank Chang below Khan and the Borg Queen, but far above all the other Trek villains. There are some tacky anachronisms typical of Meyer's style, and the usual amount of discontinuities and canon issues; but that's inevitable, and I can accept it if it leads to a good story. Trek VI is a good story. 9/10. script has just the right amount of self humor, which was dreadfully lacking from the fifth movie (e.g.: Spock: 'If I were human I believe my response would be ""go to hell."" ...If I were human.' All in all, a remarkable sign off for the original crew of the Enterprise and one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. gosh this is really different for a Star Trek film. It had so much suspense and conspiracy, and so much mystery that this was one of the best films in the collection. The acting is great, the action and the effect are superb, and the music is very good! I recommend this to all Star Trek and sci-fi film fans! Trek great is in this film: action, great one-liners from McCoy and Chekhov, the peace message, the Klingons, Spock's logic skills, literary quotes and celebrity cameos makes ""The Undiscovered Country"" a worthy send-off to perhaps the most celebrated ensemble cast in entertainment history.

A story that would give you a glimpse to a possible future and make you think about philosophical matters such as life, friendship, god, racism and others. If this is why you watch Star Trek I believe you will enjoy this film. is good but has too many quiet moments. Check out the hidden and brief ""comic reel.""At this point in time, I do rank Star Trek V above Nemesis, mainly due to that movie's bad continuity issues but just barely. Still, it is Star Trek and if you like the characters, just sit back, don't expect much and enjoy the show. awful. This film kildly leaves out the awful hippie music of the original episode and focuses solely on the plot instead. I often wonder if Shatner wrote this film to make up for how bad The Way to Eden was. So, to sum up, watch this movie as you would watch an old episode and you'll enjoy it much more. What an embarrassment.The Final Frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.* unless it's an episode with Troi's mother in it. beginning to end, and I do not even know how it was possible that such idiocy was actually carried on. The special effects are within what has been done in the previous films, the performance of the actors was not particularly inspiring, but what really put the film to waste was the plot with such absurd ideas.

This film exhibits the best cat and mouse battle in my mind and its well worth your time.Go see this movie. unreleased footage brings the whole thing together in an even better way (no spoilers, sorry!). The regular cast are at their best but Ricardo Montalban steals the show as Khan.

There are some good action scenes which go some way toward redeeming ""Batman Returns"" but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. psychopathic terrorist, killing random strangers and blowing up everything in her path when she was thrown out of a window and revived when cats tried to eat her.

Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie. film may be slightly cheesy but there is just so much to love about it, especially the soundtrack and dance moves!

I overall give this movie 7/10. is quite entertaining and I like it, and I certainly do not compare it to the first one as it is a whole new different movie and storyline.So if you haven't seen Grease 2 before because people say it's crap and that it's a waste of time, at least give it a chance and watch it, it might surprise you. adds to the general malaise.

Marked for Death (1990)	"fantastic and the dialogue is second to none, in fact for those IDM fans out there Luke Vibert sampled some in 'screwface'. Other than Segal and the platoon guy the only person I recognised was Danny Trejo, Hollywoods default Mexican criminal. This is an action classic folks, watch it or Screwface will give you a thousand deaths worse than mine. and their voodoo practising leader SCREWFACE...Que violence galore!!Expect bone breaking violence from this film, as Hatcher and Co. shoot, beat and tackle their way through the posse in order to save Hatcher and his family's lives-who have been ""marked for death"" by the gang. I would say this is one of Segal's most violent movies, and that is saying something. the action department he kicks ass. Keith David, a regular supporting actor, gives a good performance and overall the cast do a good job.Unfortunately Seagal's days of high class movies are gone and will probably never come back. But his body of work in the twentieth century will satisfy me, it's the twenty first century Seagal I'll mostly skip through. movie, where he's invading the Jamaica-man bad guy's base is especially entertaining. In this movie, he has one of the best comments of all his films:""One thought he was immortal, and the other one thought he could fly. Both were wrong"".

Who knows........ in for a very boring time, and you'll probably agree with the lowly rating that this movie has on this site.

However, when all is said and done, the viewer may wonder why they bothered watching as the story just begins and ends with no apparent reason being; no moral, no message, no lessons, not compelling or thought provoking and difficult with which to empathize. Likely to be of most interest to those who like ""all in the family"" relationship films. original play,even adding major characters that did not exist in the original.The basic story remains, a Jewish Publisher and his slow decent into dementia brought on through his loss of control of the company to his son. But there it ends. The messages in this film are very clear,but the execution,direction and scripting destroy the impact of the original play. It would have been so easy to make his character sympathetic & saintly -thankfully, Jon Robin Baitz doesn't fall into this trap. Only one criticism - could have done with a little more back story, for this viewer. Anyone who wants to know why the Shoah isn't over for many, many people could do worse than watch this film.

Under Siege (1992)	attempts by costume designers failedFACT 6 - Conflict between Lee Jones and Seagal aroze due to Lee Jones' obsession with calling Seagal, Seagull or Mr Seagull whilst leaving fish around his dressing room.FACT 7 - Seagal followed a strict diet of 9 medium raw eggs a day during filming as recommended to him by De Niro after filming Raging Bull but he looks a lot fitter than his recent films where he lumbers about, in his earlier films he actually seems in some sort of shape and actually looks tough.Overall this is an entertaining film, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are in scene stealing form as the bad guys and Seagal is at the top of his game. 8/10 and nothing but 'B' films after that.The first part of this movie is far better than the second. It gets out-of-control by the end, as most of these action films do with the violence overdone and with little credibility. But watching the three leads, and ogling Eleniak, always make this film fun to watch for a little while, at least. by the considerable time that is spent establishing the villains, who I've already noted as being the best Seagal's had to tackle. The sequel to this one was quite a letdown but still fun on its own, but in my opinion the original is Seagal's best and a great choice for those looking for some good old fashioned action heroics long as you know what you are getting into  it is not great but it is certainly one of the more enjoyable Seagal films and does manage to be a good entry in the genre and it was no surprise to me that Seagal came back for me in a less successful but equally as silly and enjoyable sequel. 	6.5	0
Terror in a Texas Town (1958)	and white. If it is a B-movie, then it is by far more unsettling than the vast majority of cheap and cheerful productions made in that budget. I cannot imagine what its intended audience must have made of it. Am I the only viewer to find myself drawn as much to the cold-blooded, isolated 'villain' as to the nominal hero? film. Hayden's take on a Swedish accent and speech patterns bounces from realistic to annoying to non-existent, but his performance is excellent, as is Cabot's. The story is riddled with moral dilemmas that give it surprising depth. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another B western. This movie has a quality that is difficult to describe. Strangely great. Award winning screenwriter Nedrick Young gives the film's best performance as Cabot's vile hired killer.Entertaining from start to finish, this is a really compelling low-budget movie that really knows what buttons to push, especially as Hayden tries to get his neighbors to break their fearful code of silence.The final showdown, glimpsed in the opening scene, is both memorable and exciting last film from western and crime movie specialist, Lewis. It`s the complete opposite of what you would expect from the title, a slow and character-driven film, beautifully shot in high contrast black and white. Cabot is especially good as a complex and troubled baddie. The final shootout comes as a complete surprise (I won`t tell you.) Recommended to Western fans.  It's hard to tell what the main interest is:  the Swedish hero; the leather-clad Bogie-inspired villain; the brave young Mexican; the callous, quick-tongued fatcat.  The cinematography is stylized yet subtle.  The dialogue is trenchant.  Then, of course, there is the unnerving harpoon showdown.  There is no movie quite like this one, folks. A must-see. 	6.8	0

The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster. those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him.

Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you.

Jaws 2 (1978)	"film takes place on land, it's sometimes slow-moving and not always interesting.  When it's on water, it's often exciting and tense, with suspense that sometimes equals the original.  It's definitely not as great a thriller as Jaws, but it is a worthy sequel and certainly is better than the likes of Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda, and Lake Placid. film. The main mistake the filmmakers made - which they wouldn't do today, was that it was too slow for too long. That, and the fact that the area residents apparently had a short memory; unrealistically short.Anyway, the shark looks more realistic.....and if you can hang in there, you'll be rewarded with some good escapist entertainment in the second hour. is. But if you want to be scared, Jaws 2 will fulfill that need just as well as the first and better than any film that has come out in the 90's.And finally, has there ever been a better tagline in the history of motion pictures? Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...... Brilliant. the victims like a horror villain should.Now of course Jaws 2 may not match up to the original film but at least the people who made this film actually tried to make a good film with a decent story. I enjoyed it and I highly recommend it, it's one of the many underrated sequels that should be given a chance. touch silly but if you think about it the ending to the original was no more silly. In the end ""Jaws 2"" is a decent but not great followup. For those that truly dislike the film I invite them to watch ""Jaws 3"" or ""Jaws: The Revenge"". Those films make part 2 look like the classic the first one is. "	5.7	0
Jaws 3-D (1983)	decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound. out there is a bigger one out there.  There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater.  This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it. nominated for a Razzie award ¿?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.This movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D, the movie was totally fabulous. But, furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it? here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone. This isn't the CHEAP red/blue anaglyph 3-D. The film used the best technology available to put you right in the movie. Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., and the other actors did a fine job. The cinematography is fantastic and shows great footage of Seaworld. 8 stars five for the film and three for the 3-D camera work. Nice one guys. 	3.6	0

The casting is good also the supporting roles from Jon Heard, Dan Aykroyd, Wilford Brimley and Lauren Baccal.All in all it is a very entertaining film, witch I recommend to anyone who is seeking for an evening of letting all tensions gliding of you and having many good laughs.On a scale 1-10, I give it an 8. like the characters in the movie. 3. None of the reviewers have said much about the ""king among the commoners"" theme. During their cross-country trek, the two former Presidents find out who their ""fellow Americans"" REALLY are - illegal immigrants, homeless families looking for a job, gay security guards, etc., etc. That's what this movie's REALLY all about. -Earth Mother a hat!"".  Beats me why he isn't in more movies.As I said, the laughs are there, and if you demand nothing more from a comedy than to laugh, you'll want to do your political duty and rent ""My Fellow Americans"" - the one movie that insults both parties equally.Seven stars, plus one extra for putting up an excellent ""fakade"". reporter, has about two scenes, and Ben just pops up out of nowhere.It was extremely funny. Its raunch mixed in with tries-to-take-it-serious humor: ""Now, if you'll excuse me, my salad's getting cold.""

Mars Attacks! (1996)	doubt he worried much about the question whether Mars Attacks! would become a success or not. He told his tale and he clearly enjoyed doing so...Why wouldn't you enjoy watching it then? Note: This review is dedicated to Mailen. A great regular user here on this site and I know for a fact that she adores this film as well... can't justify it in any rational sense, but it all just works for me. The wry wit, the blatant social and political commentary, I find it all immensely satisfying.My confession's over, I'll do my penance. But I have to also say that my granddaughter's opinion of it has never wavered. She considers this movie as evidence of my incipient senility... and social status that they spoof themselves. The special effects are also a funny part, because some of them are very well achieved and some of them are really cheesy: that's their purpose.Anyway, much more shouldn't be said, since Mars Attacks! is one of those films that you have to see for yourself, and ultimately evaluate. 9 ou of 10 of their desire to bring the famous TOPS story to the screen.  In an age in which Hollywood either promotes lavishly expensive, high-tech scripts or promotes artistic plot-driven storylines, _Mars Attacks!_ finds its own place and does not put on the facade of being something other than it is, an homage and revival of the classic '50's sci-fi B-film. as senile (Sylvia Sidney's role) is mean-spirited; Rod Steiger has the stereotypical war-mongering General is getting tiresome and the obvious politically-correct role for Jim Brown also went overboard. All in all, however, this is about as entertaining a film as I have ever found, nd one that gets more enjoyable with each viewing.....which is why I rate it so high. 	6.3	0
Citizen Ruth (1996)	"Ultimately, I was blindsided by the film's astute message, which was not even about abortion itself, but the selfish nature of the two sides arguing it.  Payne will undoubtably move on to make compelling films in the future that take advantage of higher budgets, etc., but ""Citizen Ruth"" deserves a place amongst the best first features in any genre. the movie, I did not recognize her. I believe she was not indicated for an Oscar due to the polemic theme of abortion. The performance of the cast and the direction are also excellent. My vote is seven, but maybe this movie deserves a better ranking after watching it for the second time.Title (Brazil): 'Ruth em Questão' (Ruth in Question') in this bitingly satirical look at the abortion issue in America. Dern makes an excellent centerpiece for this award winning comedy which mocks both sides of the life/choice controversy with a vanguard of comic stereotypes. ""CR"" should be an enjoyable and fun watch for those mature enough for strong language and not so brittle as to personalize the issues involved. help of Alexander Payne's brilliant direction, she nimbly walks the wire between comical hero and tragic pariah.This gem clearly demonstrates that, even though the production budget may be lower than a republican's principles - when great talent and artistic enthusiasm couple, a work of genius is likely to be born.Cheers, AB  a staff member of Prospect Point Productions, Inc. to take advantage of somebody's lack of knowledge for your own gain, or is it even okay to try to change somebody's mind?

Jerry Maguire (1996)	"noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. ""Jerry Maguire"" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind. movie finding the right balance. Renee Zellweger starts by loving Tom Cruise from afar, then gets him, then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.JM is fun to watch. The characters, though flawed, are sympathetic. We enjoy watching them succeed, fail (sometimes in funny ways), and try to discover what they really care about. It's complicated, thoughtful, and surprisingly subtle. the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent fine-tuning it to perfection, and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like, I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your self-awareness questioned once in a while. why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic. "	7.3	0
Raising Arizona (1987)	"but that just raises more sympathy for them. It also helps that they all express themselves through some razor-sharp dialogues. I could barely make out the lines because I was too busy laughing at the previous lines, you wonder where these keep coming from. This movie just isn't like anything I've ever seen. It's astoundingly funny in all its weirdness. of humor is a bit on the dry side and you love fancy camera work and Fellini-esque characters, it's your kind of movie.Trust me.Ten stars and a complimentary pack of Huggies for ""Raising Arizona"", the best Dadaist head trip film with kidnapped babies, exploding bunnies and Frances McDormand in the desert you'll ever find...that has a fight in a trailer. 'Raising Arizona' I could be here all day pointing them out. Just see for yourself. There were lots of lousy movies made in the 1980s, the Spielberg/Lucas/Simpson/Bruckheimer/John Hughes decade that dumbed down mainstream movies forever, but there were also thankfully some wonderfully inspired ones like this, 'Blue Velvet', 'Brazil', 'RoboCop', 'Repo Man', 'Eating Raoul', 'Beetlejuice', and 'The King Of Comedy'. extraordinarily serious crime. But this film makes you enjoy every minute so it's easy to forget the seriousness of the base story.While I'm not a fan of Nicholas Cage, I thought this was a perfect vehicle for him. Holly Hunter is always excellent, IMHO. Their attention to detail in crafting their characters was on point and thorough.""Well alright then."" :) somewhat crazy escaped convict. Cage and Hunter have so much love to give, they steal a baby from Mr. Arizona himself. A modern day (80's) fantasy that chooses an interesting setting to tell its tale. The hilarious innocence is non-stop as Raising Arizona showcases relationship, friendship, vanity, ignorance, and the search for peace and forgiveness. Who knows....maybe it was Utah? "	7.4	0
Tin Men (1987)	"watched this movie again recently I came up with an hypothesis regarding its lack of real success, or longevity. It's quite simple, and when you first say it, feels lame. But the more I think about it, I believe it may be true: Like most great movies that are under-appreciated, they aren't trying to impress us. They don't have to. because it brought ambiguity to that question.  When DeVito and Dreyfus spot a new business opportunity: Volkswagens, we realize these ""tin men"" are irrepressible!  They won't be stopped despite the new regulatory environment of the modern world.  For my money, this movie is Barry Levinson's best by far.  (Excellent soundtrack by Fine Young Cannibals, as well.) sweet and yes, believable final sequence.  This movie came out during a spate of late '80s blockbusters and never really found its audience, I think.  But it is one of the few late '80s movies I rewatch every couple of years and find more to appreciate with each viewing.  I would rank it as Levinson's best film. 5, Suite 414. As I walked the halls, all I could see in open offices were the Tin Men of 1963 at it again.The movie crackles and sets off sparks. You don't know who to root for, and for good reason. This is not a buddy movie, but I suspect a remembrance by Levinson of people he knew growing up. her life. All the supporting cast is excellent. I love the diner dialog which is reminiscent of Barry Levinson's previous film ""Diner."" The background scenes of Baltimore landscape add to the realistic atmosphere of the movie. Overall, I think this movie is vastly underrated. I'd love to see a sequel with Dreyfuss and DeVito as partners in a VW dealership. "	6.5	0

It's a hugely entertaining piece of the nineties. And Robert Redford has done nothing better since. that thought is not too farfetched.Talking in movie terms, this ranks as one of the better ones that center around computers.

But it is also a fine piece of filmmaking, and something any true film lover should see. you can't help but feel uncomfortable, given the age of Jena Malone at the time. I know it's 'only acting' but the scenes are very realistic and graphic for a young actress to endure.The film is one that ought to be shown to any single mother tempted to jump into a relationship with a hot-headed young man with questionable intentions. symptoms of child abuse are highlighted throughout the movie and the effect of everyone's participation documented as fair warning to the viewer.I can't praise this movie enough. A film like this raises my awareness and compassion level and makes me want to reach out to help in any way I can. It exceeds expectations in just about every way imaginable. sister.The relationships between the characters were fully developed. While I cheered when Bones' stepfather was beat up, I still had a hard time hating him as much as I should. Bones' mother, although a sympathetic character who loved her babies, I may not forgive, at least from the time she carried Bones out of the hospital.Altogether a ten star movie. astonishing.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a wonderful, heart-felt performance, and at times you just want to slap her and say ""wake up!"".  The greatest performance in this film though is by Jena Malone.  Wow, I've never seen such an intense performance by any actress let alone a child actress.All in all, a great film. *****/out of 5 "	7.4	0

Even after the nurse returns to say she is sorry and still loves him. His pride kept him from forgiveness, and presumably was responsible for his suicide in his early 60s.  Overall a fine film about young men and women and their roles in the war, and its aftermath. The photography is beautiful and the dialog unifirmly well-structured. He falls in love with a nurse and a woman who is older than him. This would be a normal love story but when you know that it was a real life episode it is better. However, things don't work out well in the end. Life does not have happy endings always. Good movie if you want to feel sentimental time.Despite of the boring beginning, the film is worth watching. It is a thought-provoking and touching love-story. Moreover, it is based on the real events. So we can get some details about Hemingway's life. If you want to create your own clear impression of this story, I would recommend you to read a book ''A Farewell to Arms'' at first. a few times and others that are familiar with ""A Farewell to Arms"" found the film to very moving. Also, it's a pleasure to see a film that is made for adults without being trashy.

Marvin's Room (1996)	"things. The scriptwriter is smart enough to realize that. Touches of humor keep this from becoming an oppressive Bergmanesque angst-fest, and its patient character development steers it out of obvious soapy (ie. ""Terms of Endearment"") territory. Although the thing has a sort of TV-movie aesthetic in the staging and the scoring, the writing and acting are everything you'd want. Beautiful. character remains a focal point. And Verdon's comic relief pairing with the younger son is a real highlight. She also manages a poignant moment or two in a her scenes with Keaton. This truly is an ensemble piece, and it wouldn't have been without their talent. Why I don't yet own a copy of this sweet film is a mystery. in this tale of hopes, emotions and intense feelings. Keaton, on the other hand portrays her best performance ever, and Leonardo DiCaprio proves that he has talents besides being a heartthrob. This movie really moved me, not because of the story itself but the acting was very realistic....I believe that they all should have received an Oscar nomination. Well done! good time girl who finally is about to graduate out of beauty school and is having trouble dealing with her sick sister, her dying father and her whacked-out teen son.  Definitely worth a view if for no other reason than to fill in the missing Keaton and/or Streep movies you may have missed.

I'm waiting! with so much weakness and guilt that sometimes you have to look away. Brilliant! Johnny Whitworth, carrying his pain with shame and confusion is an amazing revelation.

Shirley Knight (Heavenly in ""Sweet Bird Of Youth"") and Brian Donovan as the deaf brother are two characters I would've loved to see more of.

Where else will you get Dave Letterman playing former Motley Crue roadies turned drifters? ""wood"", or another scene where a man asks the pair ""have you got a match?"" ""Yeah,"" replies Butthead, the slightly smarter of the two, ""my butt and ... uh ... your butt"". It's childish, but it made me laugh. Not the most subtle exercise in wit, the film is still a worthwhile, and, by it's own small ambitions, successful picture. go on a long journey to some of the country's most famous locales. The authorities always seem to be two steps behind in this film that has a comedic life of its own. Interesting voice characterizations by Judge, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Cloris Leachman and the golden-voiced Robert Stack all match their animated alter-egos perfectly. 3.5 out of 5 stars. though she was one of the bad guys. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure gut-buster to all you fans of the ""BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD"" TV show who have not seen the movie. You're in for a lot of gut-busting laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. "	6.8	0
Scream (1996)	the dialogues in this movie, I love Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker in here.10/10 Scream deserves a legendary status it is my personal favorite horror slasher film from Wes Craven in the franchise. I have the whole collection on Blu-ray discs and I have the first three movies on VHS tapes. I love this film to death I love it! and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade:  A- is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend  a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask, the one-liners, and the unique self-awareness when it comes to horror clichés make Scream a true original  accept no imitations. cast being filled of up and coming faces (including Ulrich) makes it even more thrilling when the `wrong' people get killed, technically all the cast are `unknowns' who usually make up the body count, so really anyone can potentially get offed.Overall funny black comedy, scary thrills and gory excitement.  A rare treat  a really good teen horror movie will keep you at the edge of your seat. A movie that you'll rewind and want to watch again and again. And after the 50th time you watch it, you'll say, just one more time. So, if you have good taste, or are looking for something original, watch this film. And get the trilogy DVD set. It's a screamer! 10/10 	7.2	0
Last of the Mohicans, The (1992)	"echoing that brilliant piece of work. I am a very very huge fan of Hans Zimmer, but I doubt if even he could have done a better job.I have seen the movie eight times to date. And I will definitely see it again. The climactic scene is so moving that I have lost count how many times I've seen that. the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10 nature, and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated. The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid. This is a film worth seeing, one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy. Grady Harp for the events that take place.  Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi, Dances with Wolves) draws in a fair amount of empathy.The Last of the Mohicans is a marvelous, visual adventure that thoroughly reveals the horrors of warfare, the wildness of a chaste frontier, and the fated and ill-fated romances of the characters involved. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe. Wes Studi is mesmerizing as the ""bad guy."" If you liked him in ""Geronimo: An American Legend,"" you'll like his work here.If you are fairly young and only know Michael Mann through his crime movies like ""Heat"" or ""Collateral,"" please check this earlier film out.

Michael (1996)	"of jhclues who echoes my feelings about the movie so much that I feel it would be redundant of me to restate, probably poorly, all that they have already committed to page.It is also interesting that so many people really hated it. I wonder if they weren't just put off by the ""less than traditional"" view of a religious subject. everywhere, but the plot isn't the point. Just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way. There is nothing to dislike about this movie, unless one is searching for something profound. I wish there were more movies like this. We need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical. won't go into details. Michael isn't about a complex plot anyway. It just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip.John Travolta's performance as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky?Watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time. Highly recommended. Michael, an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels. And you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to ""Chain of Fools"". I love this movie more and more every time I watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from John Travolta. a puritan is different from being good. Michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.Funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy. Watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. "	5.7	0
Evening Star, The (1996)	"and the trials of a non-traditional family. Paxton plays a nice role in this film adding a little flare to the shadowing plot of Shirley MacLaine's character getting older. Nicholson's return, although brief, helped this film round itself out. See this one only if you see Terms of Endearment first.Best Scene: Nicholson and MacLaine re-living the past on the beach. Juliette Lewis does another of her typically strong turns, and never has Marion Ross been given a better opportunity to demonstrate her surprising range.  Still, credible acting and an 11th hour appearance of (an embarrassed-looking) Jack Nicholson can only do so much for this contrived mess, and one cannot help but wonder why they couldn't leave well enough alone. ""The Evening Star"" is that it tries to hold true to the book and the first movie. Perhaps most importantly, it shows how important Hector and Rosie were in Aurora's life. As a fan of both the books and the first movie, I was happy to see how well this movie brought them all together. It's one of my favorites. actors making walk on appearances. Overlong and underwritten, the film misses the interest of the original, not to mention any inkling of James L. Brooks' involvement. There's no Danny DeVito, and no Jeff Daniels (which is very odd considering he was the father of the three but is omitted from the film). Nowhere near as good as the first.Grade: C- did a fabulous job. Miranda Richardson as well, Juliette Lewis, Mackenzie Astin, everybody. I think they all did a fantastic job. Jack Nicholson was a small part in the movie, yes, but the beach scene is what really brings it all to life. I love that movie just as much now as I did the first time I saw it. "	5.8	0

All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it. want to jump out of my chair and start applauding.Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience.This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling, brilliant acting,and incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one. "	7.8	1

Oh and if the soundtrack sounds vaguely familiar it may be because it is by Bill Whelan of Riverdance fame. this is a brief moment in a film that`s preceeded by polemical opinion which screams "" Britain is entirely responsible for the troubles "" and finishes with a caption giving the names of the ten IRA/INLA hunger strikers . I guess it would have been too much to print the names of those murdered by these particular hunger strikers ? attack and subsequent capture of Higgins and Quigley. The scene involving the IRA's retaliation murder of the Maze prison guards happens far too quickly for the viewer to understand what is going on. And let's face, watching people starve to death is not very exciting.I still gave this movie 6 out of 10, because of the fine acting and music.Irish44 on their lives, yet they must find ways to overcome and affect what positive change they can.Some say there is not enough ""action"" in the film.

This film is about how episodes of moving history effects everyday people's lives. last names between the two women -- it's unfair to expect Yanks to pick that up.

I found the date scene to be a little too long, and the Mrs Robinson sequence should have been almost completely eliminated. It is a painfully bad gag, and the humor of it is something that can only be appreciated by those of a certain mind set. Don't worry, I'm not insulting you if you like it. banana at Reynolds when she questions why women leave him. And when Brooks and his brother fight over Reynolds like she was their mistress. The ending is a little too pat -- I don't think sons ever resolve their conflicts with their mothers, or even understand them. But it's Brooks' best film after Lost in America. And that ain't bad. plays Carl in the movie and he's very good.Mother is a terrific movie that combines comedy and drama in a fine way.It's mighty funny when John makes his room look like exactly the same it looked like when he originally lived there.I think we all should take trips to the past every now and then.Maybe we learn something about ourselves. using it as a backdrop to a wider story, the film chooses to pursue limited ambitions, and there's a level of contrivance necessary to support this narrow focus: while, at a micro-level, the film is perfect, the overall plot makes less sense, and the ending is a little pat. Not a great film; but one guaranteed to make you smile. "	6.9	0
Thieves (Les Voleurs) (1996)	"are finally getting married! They invited you to come along as well! Well over all I do recommend that if you're looking for a cute family film, this is a good one, I just preferred Return of Jafar a little more, but it's all good, this was still a worthy sequel and a good finish to the story of Aladdin.6/10 returns he has a gag every ten seconds, but most of them land pretty well. The songs are quite good, and the characters are really quite fun. The animation is not that great, but it works well enough where you don't really notice it. I recommend this finale to the Alddin trilogy.My rating-*** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G. the Genie and is as hilarious as ever. I don't care if he was over done or not, he was very funny and vital to the movie. The songs were much better than people make them out to be. This movie had a great story and was a fitting end to the Aladdin story. Thumbs way up on this one. made some fine direct-to-video sequels. Most are pretty good. ""King Of Thieves"" is worthwhile. Disney's first made-for-video picture was ""The Return Of Jafar"" (the first ""Aladdin"" sequel). ""Lion King II - Simba's Pride"", and ""Pocahontas II - Journey To A New World"" are others. I recommend all of them.Give Disney some credit. These are great additions to my Disney Library. has a totally different approach. The result is a very, very decent soundtrack! Nice songs, though not impressive. Animation has some flaws, but all and all very well drawn, too! The new characters are fun, I just love Cassim!!!

The extras were neither overly good looking or freakishly ugly. They looked like anyone you would see walking down any given street.The cinematography is splendid, and it's hard to beat the soundtrack.It's an 8/10 for me. for the talented composer; a tribute long overdue, if you ask me. Excellent casting! Excellent effects! Excellent movie!To quote TIME magazine, ""You must see 'Evita.'"" Yes, you must. Some of you will love it, some will hate it. But I hope that you all agree that Lloyd Webber is a genius. He is the true star of the film. 10/10 too, and did again, genius work.  He is a stage actor, so of course he played Juan's intensity just right.  All three of these actors deserved AT LEAST Golden Globes, and Madonna deserved an Oscar, along with the director who blew your mind with the movie, making you laugh and cry.  This movie is in one word...phenomenal. voice and screen presence. Pryce's performance is a triumph of the actor's craft. Banderos is a perfect Che, although, in my view, he shines as a tertiary star behind Madonna and Pryce.See Evita, if you haven't already. If you've seen it ten times, see it again. There is still more pleasure to take from this wonderful film with each viewing. did a fine job. Banderas was simply fantastic. Most of the naysayers (and there are many), clearly don't care for Weber, or for musicals in general. Of course it isn't ""deep"", it's a musical!

They are backed by a solid cast of major actors in minor roles, all adding to Isabel's complex societal tragedy.Portrait of a Lady, particularly this film adaptation, is a remarkable example of how stories may stay the same, but their meanings change over time.Related films include:  Washington Square (1997), The House of Mirth (2000), The Buccaneers (1995)(mini). color to her story, even after repeated viewings. And her Isabelle Archer (beautifully realized by Nicole Kidman, in possibly her finest performance to date) is as fully tested and tried by life's moral and epistemological ambiguities, and as fully responsive to life's promise, on film, as Henry James's heroine is, on the printed page. One could hardly ask for more. Isabel.  But as someone already commented, the most worthy element here is Martin Donovan as Ralph, Isabel's sickly cousin in love with her, and whose advice sets the whole story in motion.  He doesn't play for sentiment, but earns it instead.  The ending also keeps its power.  Still, this is quite a missed opportunity for Campion. prefer to know that their hero/heroine is ""safe"" at the end of the story.  Here, who knows ?Production values are good, and the film is quite stylish with interesting use of camera tilt, lighting, and angles.  It's quite artsy.  I am glad I saw the film, but acknowledge it's not likely to be everyone's cup of tea. Age of Innocence' (1993)(qv). I am expecting great things from Ms Campion: she is not yet 50, and in the world of art 50 years of age is but the threshold to maturity. But with `The Portrait of a Lady' she has already reached such heights of perfection that it is seemingly impossible to go much further. Or can she? "	6.3	0
Walkabout (1971)	"it is time for the industry worldwide to wake up to the fact that a wealth of film exists outside of Hollywood, and that the viewing public may actually welcome some variety.With the release of the director's full cut in 1998 both the DVD and the video are unusually available for the UK as well as the US from Amazon. in juxtaposition with the hardness and neuroses of society, not as WHITEMAN BAD but as society, modern society makes us very neurotic by taking away our innocence. Roeg makes an brilliant point and stylizes a mostly nonverbal experience by letting us journey with children all on the cusp of some new stage of growth. This movie is a small masterpiece!! can end it when the two children get back to civilisation. But does the story end there?

Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival (1996)	"Morrison (both of whom died just after the festival) as well as numerous other pop, folk, and rock artists make this film wonderful just as a concert video. Even more revealing, though, is footage of the festival's production and management, including riots, rebellious patrons, break-ins, and mordant commentary on why rock festivals don't happen anymore.  Beautifully paced and edited. the Who being edited in for one more song each. An uneasy truce is reached but when Rikki flashes a double peace sign at the crowd he only succeeds in looking like Richard Nixon.

It will not insult many viewers' intelligence for starters. While not 100 per cent original, it is a very well-made film that rests on a solid plot and direction. assigned to the case, with White House security personnel limiting the detectives with classified information which may be useful to the case. Lucky for them, a dedicated Secret Service Agent (Diane Lane) reluctantly helps.Although it gets predictable at times (especially at the end), it's still a fun little thriller. It really gives you a deep feeling of paranoia as well! years ago, is on hand as a senior Secret Service agent and Dennis Miller has a small role as a fellow D.C. detective. While MURDER AT 1600 is not a first-rate action film -- for one thing, it is chock full of tired plot devices -- it is certainly watchable. And it beats anything Snipes has done since going STV. background music is very manipulative.""Murder At 1600"" comes across as your typical big-budget, high profile film right off the Hollywood assembly line. It's got visual pizazz and lots of ""action"". But the story lacks substance and depth, the characters are stereotyped, and the dialogue is vapid. It's just one more example of how Hollywood throws production megabucks as substandard screenplays. Benzali is ominous as the head of Secret Service. Snipes asks him what it would take for him to see some White House records and Benzali dryly answers, ""Oh, not much. Just an act of Congress.""

I wont give any of the plot twists away (there are a few) but I will say, go and watch it. Its not funny, its not action packed, but it is a good movie dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his dastardly role well. Do not look for humor in this film, there is none. It is real, savage and gritty to the last, and to the sensitive I'd say bring a box of tissues. But movies as great as this make you wonder, why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of? tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break, and there are certainly few light moments.Will never be able to view Nigel Hawthorne the same again. He came across as a very twisted individual, and I found myself disliking him more each time he appeared.Totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments. between Hawthorne and Lou Gossett are equally notable.Arthur Penn directs, this his last film. Penn is famous for such films as Bonnie and Clyde (1967), ""The Miracle Worker"" (1962), and ""Little Big Man"" (1970). The current film shows his heritage from his work on Playhouse 90 which this film more represents that the wide screen films he is famous for. 90 minutes of people being tortured by a sadistic colonel(Nigel Hawthorne), with no real depth to it. It's all presented in a rather cold fashion too.

It's also nice for an Aussie to see Bille Brown making his big screen debut as the terrible right-hand man Neville.Overall, it's an above average piece of writing, directing and performing that gives you a laugh. Perfect for a night in. 3 1/2 stars out of 5. playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch.Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix. it would be in the soundtrack department - i just didn't think it was as good as it could have been - but this makes little difference to the overall flow of the film, and I have no hesitation in awarding it 9.5 out of 10, and recommending it to anyone that enjoys a well made and endearing, quality comedy. I'm gonna have to see it sometime. The humor is excellent; black, crude humor at its best. All in all, a very good comedy if you don't mind some tacky humor. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors, fans of tacky/crude/black humor and even fans of Monty Python, since both members involved in this are great. 7/10 bursting with witheringly literate putdowns and rejoinders, performances given just the right amount of push over the edge, and someone's best-laid schemes unraveling in hilariously improbable fashion. Kevin Kline oozes handsome, clueless yuppie smarm from every pore; John Cleese plays a take-charge-but-eventually-beleaguered Basil Fawlty variation with his usual timing mastery.A should-be comedy classic that doesn't get the praise it's due. 	6.4	0

I particularly enjoyed the way the camera shots were laid out so that viewers get an ""animal's eye view"" throughout the movie.Unlike many ""art"" films, this story at least makes sense, shows people (including children) doing worthwhile things and being nice to each other. Another plus is the use of minority actors in non-stereotype roles. up the sky with their fireworks.  The kids are great too.  But, a movie like this needs a worthy villain.  Although I never heard of Arnold Vosloo before, he does a marvelous job playing Oil Can Harry to Steve Guttenberg's Mighty Mouse.  Sure, it's far-fetched.  It's supposed to be.  Just relax and have fun. with the Goth look, you have no clue about teenagers, she came across as a typical one. The animals were good too and all in all it was a nice easy to watch movie and I'd rather watch it 10 times than have to sit through ""Big Momma's House 2"" and it's ilk just the once. 7 out of 10. saw it, and it cheered me up. Silly - in the best possible sense of the word. Guttenbuurg and Arquette are ideal as the parents; the kids are perfect; the villain is fun; and the dolphin is beautiful - but Zeus, the dog, really steals the film. Watch and enjoy with any kid you know - especially your boyfriend (tee-hee). annoying, but very appealing. I usually watch mysteries, but ""Zeus and Roxanne"" is a very pleasant change of entertainment atmosphere.

Underworld (1996)	"weapons and unload on the bar, the bartender... and finally the outright hilarious shot of the scariest of them putting a gun to his head: they shoot each other.Yes, it's terribly violent; yes, it's not for everyone. But this is the one of the most fabulously overlooked films ever! Awesome!Check it out, but ignore the section you found it in. funnier, quirkier, and slightly less hard boiled version of Pulp Fiction. Again NO it's not the Godfather or Goodfellas, and is not a ""classic"" It is a minor gem that deserves far better than the lousy 4 point something it gets here. Check it out and decide for yourself! for fans of the genre you won't be wasting your time. reality is nonsensical, long, boring, self important crap. No police are involved, even though gangland assassinations are taking place on a schedule that makes Al Capone look like a small time hood. The dialog is repetitive nonsense that has nothing to do with what is on the screen. This is a totally failed film that should be avoided. - MERK it.I read a review which compared the film unfavourably to Pulp Fiction, it is unfortunate that title was mentioned on the back of the DVD, don't blame anyone but the marketing dept. Underworld has more in common with The Two Jakes than Pulp Fiction. As you can see I loved this film, it gets a massive thumbs up from me. few aesthetically pleasing moments of lighting and direction that might surprise you.All in all, if you're a strong fan of either Leary or the modern crime genre, it's worth a look for only it's hour and a half run time. But if you have something better or just not in the mood, this film isn't going to turn any heads. "	4.9	0
Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)	"more to offer than jokes involving head and groin injuries. Perhaps his choice in films were poor but to don't deny him the recognition of his talent is unfair. Watch the movie and you'll see Farley display all the qualities of a great comedian: intelligence, timing, pathos.  He was a tremendous talent and I will miss him very much. this film for Chris Rock. Rock's performance is perfect, despite being too small of a role. Farley's performance is perfect as the bumbling but good-hearted ""Great White Ninja."" Even the chicken's performance is perfect. If you find the concept of a fat, white ninja involved in an Asian gang war mildly provocative, check your brain at the door and enjoy. so much time reviewing it. Don't see this movie hoping for a great story or accurate ninja fighting action, or compelling drama like some of the commentors here seem dissapointed with. Take the stick out yer bum and relax. Just enjoy Chris Farley at his best. Few movies have ever made me laugh harder. I'm not an aged 8-14 male. a fifth degree black belt (godan) and on many occasions have felt as goofy and clumsy as Farley's character in this funny gem.  I truly love this movie, except it really saddens me to think Farley is not with us anymore.  This guy was great.  Rest in Peace big fellow. Thanks for this great, silly, funny movie. children. Beverly Hills Ninja, however is appropriate for most children 10 and over. Pretty mild by today's standards.One of my favorite performances in this movie is the work of supporting actor Robin Shou. He is a great straight man and shows great martial arts skills as well as comedic timing. Chris Rock also has a small roll in this film. "	5.5	0
Metro (1997)	"narrative in Metro is very much serious and the standard cop thriller we'd come to expect.Overall, Metro is not a bad effort and the action sequences are well executed. Murphy gives a surprising turn and performance as Roaper and thus it makes a change to see him in an almost completely non-comedic role, which he does well in.Not bad indeed. good performances from the whole cast. Murphy, in what I think is one of his better roles, gives us his comedic touch, but this is more of a dramatic, serious role for him. I saw not Murphy, but Scott Roper, throughout the whole movie. A sure sign that an actor is doing his job quite well! - Murphy is superb. he´s complaining too much. If he dies in ""Metro"" or not, I´ll let you figure out for yourself. Back to ""Metro"" now. If you don´t expect any clever ideas, just some good action sequences with a silly plot, it´s not that bad. But on the other hand, not that good either.* * ½ out of * * * * * bathroom mirror searching for something. The music swells. She starts to close it and what does the viewer expect? To see the face of the killer when the mirror closes. But nada. Those are really refreshing bits.Murphy's performance is quite solid, the story is what to expect from an action movie and refreshed, as I said, by the bits above. HILLS COP movies, but he sure seems a lot like him. It also steals elements from some of his earlier films. In my opinion, this is a guy movie. The women will probally be bored by the non-stop action and the fact that the only woman in the movie is Eddie Murphy's girlfriend, but action fans will LOVE this movie!!! "	5.5	0
Machine, The (1994)	"""Welcome!"" cheerily.  The HUD from the machine's point of view displays 1P and Hi Score.

Dig in. kinda adds to the charm.Final word goes out to Mr Dourif, who steals every scene he is in. He's funny, creepy, pathetic and totally manic. I have a feeling Norrington just let Dourif go wild in the role.TTKK's Bottomline - If you like sci-fi/horror mixed with a bit of cheese and some laughs, you can't go wrong with Death Machine in various movies (Alien : Resurrection, The Prophecy III), series (Star Trek : Voyager) and even a game (Myst III : Exile), all in which he put down a fantastic performance, even when the movie or series wasn't upto much good. (Voyager, Alien 4 and The Prophecy 3 for example) If I had ten thumbs, I'd put them all up! imagination. There ARE some fairly bloody moments but I don't think this film really deserves the 18 certificate, I've seen worse in 15-rated movies.The film remains constantly engaging, has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other low-budget sci-fi horror movies. Great fun. get you ! If this movie reminds you of some other classics , namely –Hardware , Alien , Carpenter's movies ,you are on the right track , as all the actors even bear the familiar names ,e.g. Scott Ridley , Yutani , Carpenter etc. Briefly , still fresh , amusing , and above all, hardcore , and utterly bleak !

Stranger, The (1994)	"the best role in here, in my opinion. Reed did a nice job of acting but I didn't care for her persona.

It did read ""R"" on my VHS tape. film too. becomes, Reed shines, easily gathering in acting honours with a subtly layered and credible performance, and O'Quinn also acts well, especially in light of his written dialogue. Richard Leiterman's cinematography is expert as always and fitting underscoring is contributed by Joseph Conlan, but the scenario's collapse into nearly total incongruity and odd character metamorphosis becomes too great of a handicap. The woman's drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce.At one stage Pierce is innocently making ""vegeburgers"". The husband enters. Pierce resumes making vegeburgers. The husband then assaults Pierce. Little chunks of half-eaten vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome.

The reasons for this were never clear to me as a paying film-goer. I recommend this heartily to all.

Eliott G only has little face time. Yet Narrates through-out. The ""older woman/kisser"" is way hotter than Michelle P.I count nine, so far.

To add to the incestuous overtones, Gainsbourg is Birkin's niece, and first gained notoriety duetting with her legendary father Serge on a pop ditty titled ""Lemon Incest"" while barely in her teens. The layers continue by Birkin casting his own son Ned as the younger cross-dressing brother. This is a very strange and beautiful movie. Highly recommended. set in the sixties or the nineties. The overall feel is one of banality, lethargy, and a total absence of passion or vitality. Perhaps it's only in a situation like this that the relationship Jack and Julie have can flourish, and Jack can transform from a petulant, self-absorbed boy to a responsible, loving young man. Strange atmosphere, but very rewarding. the cross-dressing younger brother, and his sub-plot is not developed, which is probably just as well since he exhibits little talent. I suppose this is included to emphasize the point that in a family untrammeled by conventional moralities, each individual is accepted with whatever modus operandi ""works"" for him or her. Not an altogether bad idea when one considers it... the acting. I think some who have found any serious fault in the production are just trying to justify their uncomfortable feelings about the subject matter.Anyway, read the other comments, choose for yourself whether or not you care to watch it. But, if you are not put off by the subject matter, you will find a beautiful and sad story. "	7.2	0

It's good escapist fare, and that's all. It's worth two looks. lava? The answer is yes but just barely. Dedication means that you stay with the truck and the NASA signal device for at least 2 or 3 days until someone can drag you out and also get the family you were trying to save. Then you can go sea fishing after your compound fracture heals. This is a great movie. having enough integrity to make an entertaining film within the boundaries of scientific accuracy. And face it, you don't go to a movie like Dante's Peak to see insightful drama, or peer deep into the human psyche. The people and the volcano play off each other very nicely. It's not often you get a film with both chemistry and physics. bass sound effects.It's not a life-changing film by any means, but as disaster movies go it's one of the best, has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog (more original) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character. lacking in substance too and almost condescending to the viewer. But, as I said, not all the writing is bad: an example is the excellent delivery of a reference to Pompei by one of Harry and Paul's colleagues and another's excitement over Rachel's regular coffee deliveries.In the end, when this movie is bad, it's bad, but in general it's good. 	5.9	0

It's just too bad that he never made a funny film after ""Back To School"". The fact that he co-wrote the screenplay to this movie does not help his legacy. He made a wise move by not appearing in ""Caddyshack II"" (1987), but somehow his fate with future movies was not as well-thought- out. it was a funny movie,and a few scenes were very funny. it's never boring or stupid. there are a few,and i do mean few scenes that are unfunny,but not stupid. the plot holes are the only thing that keeps this movie from a bulls-eye,but it still has a number of laughs. i give meet wally sparks **1/2 out of **** priceless!

Amos & Andrew (1993)	"Montgomery bone-chillingly brings to life in one of her best performances, burying her Samantha Stephens image forever. Strong support is also provided by screen veterans Dorothy McGuire, Pat Morita, and Ray Walston but it is the Emmy-nominated performances by Douglas and Montgomery that are the main selling points here. It's no CUCKOO'S NEST, but it is an entertaining second cousin. a few. The best scenes in this movie are between stubborn ""Amos Lasher"" (Kirk) and ""Daisy Daws"" (Liz) who butt heads more than once.  Dorothy McGuire gives a touching performance as a lonely woman who falls for Amos.  Not only good drama but a movie with a social message as well regarding the treatment of our senior citizens. good to see that these folks still had it no matter their age, and to see the big screen's most famous gladiator meet the small screen's most famous witch (and she's a REAL witch here). Also starring Dorothy McGuire (of ""Gentleman's Agreement""), Pat Morita (of the ""Karate Kid"" movies) and Ray Walston (Mr. Hand in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). after you! watch older folks get beat up?Amos isn't the best senior-cast film I've seen, and in general, I watch a lot of them. It's meant to be exciting-and at times it is-but all in all, it's mostly sad. You're better off renting films with younger versions of the stars, unless you go in for depressing old-people movies, like Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. "	7.1	0

In both ""Prefontaine"" and ""Silkwood"", the message to the rest of us ordinary mortals is: don't underestimate your life; do your best; and make each day count.  You never know when ""fate"" may intervene. so with this film. Pre emerges a gifted, young, confused but determined individual who inspires not through his athletic performances but through the strength of his character and what he did for amateur athletics. The ending doesn't so much jerk tears from the viewer as it allows them to flow freely and copiously. An underrated, lost gem of a film. run. If memory serves, the release also had a woefully limited marketing budget.An athletic apparel store in Boston has a glass case which displays one of Steve Prefontaine's running singlets. It made me pause to see it there, an inanimate object which once clothed someone so highly animated. This film does a decent job of bringing life to that persona. is just a backdrop, a supplement to my race against myself, my own times, and my fellow runners.  They push me, I push them, like Viren does Pre.  This movie captures all of the aspects of a race and the qualities of a true runner. If you run for fun, your drive to strive will reach unfathomable levels. embraced challenge and competition, propelled himself to the top, and then his ultimate fate.To measure a movie's success, I take note of my thoughts the following day. Anyone watching ""Prefontaine"" in 1972 run the 5000 could not help but be inspired. And now in the late 1990's, the movie ""Prefontaine"" refreshes that inspiration.

Tickle in the Heart, A (1996)	the movie is in black and white. I don't see the point. Color would have added so much more to the picture.

Guantanamera (1994)	"(or just to hear the Cuban dialect, with its dropping of esses). But anything looking at people's individuals lives and how policies have affected them gets praise from me. We see how people have to abide by food rationing, among other things (of course, this is mainly due to the US blockade against the island). So I recommend this film. humour with the corpse, near the end, really grows an uneasy feel on you. All these lines are perfectly integrated by a well managed road trip, and a good adaptation of an eternal song, which incidentally is an avatar for the cuban soul.This is like an Italian post-modern ""sweet"" film, but better, because it is more meaningful.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com in daily Cuban life.The Director went beyond official parameters and adopted a critical attitude before the difficulties faced by people in actual Cuba.It is like Gutierrez Alea tells us: ""let's laugh of our disgrace."" Gutierrez Alea earned two things with this movie: the laugh of the audience, and the ire the President of his country in one of his speeches mad because he fears he won't be able to realize his time schedule. His character is good for a smile.The Cuban film Guantanamera` wants to be everything: comedy, romance and a satire on the communist system in Cuba. It's half-baked but ... nice. And I was surprised about the actors: they did a good job and obviously they enjoyed it. road and the jauntily resigned renditions of the title song, which makes for good but not very provocative entertainment. The film seems to look back more than forward, with a pervasive sense of quiet nostalgia and regret about it, although there's also a gentle postivism that things can be overcome (with no thanks to the political infrastructure, it subtly suggests).

When ever I want a good laugh this is one of the films I watch. from beginning to end. Bruce Campbell of course makes this worth seeing by himself, but the rest of the cast hold their own. Tom Arnold usually is seen as a bad indicator of quality, but his cheesy dialog has its moments. Rent it, buy it, just watch it, and judge for yourself. It will not be a waste of time. so I've no point of reference with regard to how accurately this film captures the atmosphere of the show, but somehow I can't believe it was as lame as this. If it was the film would never have been greenlighted.Do yourself a favour and do what everyone involved in this mess should have done: give it a wide, wide berth. I'm glad that they had Ernest Borgnine, the original McHale, as Cobra.And, last, but DEFFINITELY not least, Tom Arnold. I used to watch Roseanne, and always liked his obnoxious humor.

Setting the story against the backdrop of the approaching Velvet Revolution emphasizes Louka's spiritual growth.

Kolya is singing before and during the closing credits.  The vintage film footage of Kubelik conducting Smetana's Ma Vlast at a concert at the end of the Russian occupation is a wonderful touch.  Although I'm sure many other Czech films deserve Oscars, I am glad Kolya was recognized.  I hope this film is released on DVD soon.  Kolya's funeral for the puppet, and the lump-in-the-throat moment when Kolya tries to call his babushka in the bathtub. Give that kid another acting job!  A beautiful film.

Well played out by theactors/actresses.....a memorable one being the piano player/hotel owner with his songs. awkward at times with low end production value and relatively unknown actors. However, factor in some side characters and an ample helping of vintage pop love songs and you have a mildly amusing little flick with some heart which should make an okay small screen watch for those in the mood for romcom fare. Keep expectations real and enjoy. (C+) better slicker films are the norm. HOTEL DE LOVE is a cute idea with some money behind it, and very good looking young actors, but it lurches into amateur constantly, one dreadful downside of the writer also being the director and the enterprise needing a strong no nonsense helm.

It's one of my all-time favourite movies. that she is a star and can carry a movie (or at least half of it) on her back. Perry brings a great sense of comedy to the movie.

The rest of the cast provide adequate support.The movie is full of light and delightful moments. Though there are certain aspects of culture clash, it is all presented in a humorous manner. Supporting the movie is a wonderful soundtrack, some fine location shots and the funny screenplay itself (which is predictable but doesn't spoil the fun on the way). Matthew leaves (and is brought back by Salma with her underwear down around her knees) is particularly delightful. I laughed so hard at the scene where Matthew is brought home full of cactus and says ""Lucy you've got some explaining to do"" that my wife came in to see if I had hurt myself.All in all a very pleasant experience. plays.

Janeane Garofalo, Lolita Davidovich and Gina Gershon) adds color and texture to the story without detracting from the quiet chemistry going on between Skeet Ulrich and Bridget Fonda. When Ulrich says without grandeur that he believes in God and miracles, you don't even think twice about it - you believe every word he says at face value. A rare performance. Zerbe and Tom Arnold especially, are excellent, too. Arnold, in particular, brings an amazing zeal and perfect, inadvertent humour to his portrayal of a slightly militarist, born again, religious fanatic. Certainly the movie raises more questions than it answers, and it is not quite as spiritually provocative or deep as Bigas Luna's Renacer, but it is certainly well worth watching. 	5.7	0
Absolute Power (1997)	comedy. Nevertheless, it does tap into the feeling that many Americans have had, ever since the Watergate affair, that their Presidents cannot always be trusted to tell the truth. It is significant that the hero of this film is a burglar by trade; the implication is that such a man may be less of a crook than a politician. 7/10 antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today's comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.A curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don't understand why he didn't cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge. implausible for my taste. PARTING IMPRESSION--Solid entertainment. This rating denotes that. Sure, won't win any Oscars, but that's not why you really want to see a film like this. We all root for these high stakes take-the-money-and-run type finales and here we are satiated in the chicanery, the likes of which could only emanate from D.C. Seven out of ten. make his way through a nicely structured scenario. Although the action itself is ageless, one sign definitely links the movie to the 90s the blatant lack of respect for the person of the US President and the undisguised criticism of political corruption. Maybe a way to exorcise the scandals that have been plaguing the White House over the last decades... its compactness gives the whole endeavor a choppy feel at times.ABSOLUTE POWER is a film you really want to like. There is considerable talent involved here, and the movie's heart seems to be in the right place. But like that one photo we all have in our album, this one didn't turn out as good as we would have hoped. 	6.7	0

Then TRY to remember something significant that the cat in the new version did.See, you're learning! on. And although I'm not a kid, I don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids?

On this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself. It was just nice to see Dean Jones even if for just a cameo appearance, he was a regular on the great old Disney's films. I cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie. with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap Disney re-make aimed at very undemanding children. I could watch Ricci all day so I'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you too are a Ricci fan, a cat-lover, or very small child, I doubt you will find this very entertaining.

Vegas Vacation (1997)	"Vegas, and I love this movie. When my wife and I fly to Vegas, we always kid about going to the bathroom to join ""the club"" like Clark and Ellen. Numerous other things remind us of the movie when we are in Vegas, and it has made those trips even more enjoyable. Just wish Chevy would do another ""Vacation"" movie. inane, if scenarios are too illogical for words, and if not everything really comes together by the end, at least you have plenty of funny material to laugh away at, and that makes for a jolly good outing, when you find yourself laughing consistently throughout the film, which warrants a solid recommendation for ""Vegas Vacation"".

Based on many opinions, here is the order of the Vacations, starting with the best and ending with the worst:1.  a tie between ""Vacation"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" 2.  Vegas Vacation being a fair third, and 3.  European Vacation being a very distant fourth.  Hope this helps, all. little too easily too. There are, however, enough scattered good moments here to make the film possibly worth a look. The return of the blonde in a convertible (from the first film) is a nice touch, some dam wordplay surprisingly works well, a sun-roof incident is quite funny and what a way the film depicts to obtain a fake ID! experience. Still can't figure out how the daughter grew up Latina but Marisol Nichols is so cute, who cares?  Sinatra imitator very funny, as is the seemingly five minutes of silence they hold on the Quaid/Newton bit.

This is the kind of subversive edge that the great screwballs had, right down to including a pompous wannabe politician and a gold-digging second wife.Bravo. If only they'd make more like this. How about a sequel or the same team coming back together for another project? any good but i rented it anyway. Boy was I wrong because this movie is so funny especially Bette Midler and Dennis Farrina as a two people who love each other that much that they hate each others guts. And there is more romance, I willl not say between who.... but its so cute. Rent this movie  IT'S FUNNY!!!! awesome overall. I might just be naive, but this film kept surprising me all the time, and I can't recall the last time any movie has gone by so fast. There is not great depths in the plot, it's just plain old 'feel good have fun' hour and a half !Worked for me, went straight into my top ten ! extreme, yet how true to life in some moments. It grows on you! Needless to say, when I like a movie that much I go and buy the video too. It's an endearing comedy to lighten your day, overall entertainment, and everyone does a fine job with their part in this ""over the top"" comedy. Try it, you'll like it! who are both fantastic, but watch this movie for Paula Marshall and Danny Nucci.  They are both hilarious and sweet.  This movie may not be the most popular one, but I'd rather watch this than many of the romantic comedies that have come out recently.  Rent it, especially if you're a romantic comedy fan!

Lost Highway (1997)	featuring greats like David Bowie, Lou Reed, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor and more - which fits and enhances the images on screen perfectly.As far as I'm concerned, this is Lynch at his best.

David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it.  Having watched it 13 times I can pretty safely say that my theory of the plot is set, but I still love to ponder exactly why. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes, but I enjoyed how well-made it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films, rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 10/10 	7.6	1
Rosewood (1997)	"the color of their skin but by the content of their character"" in the words of the great Martin Luther King JR. PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE!! If Americas can take the violence that is in video games and stupid horror movies they should be able to take the true portrayal of man's inhumanity to man in this most wonderful film!! to grow which makes me mad.Stop being idiots! There are some very touching moments in this movie.There are moments that may bring tears in your eyes.Acting work is brilliant in the movie.Jon Voight and Ving Rhames do very powerful role works.During Rosewood I had many feelings inside me.One of them was anger.I'm white and not always so proud of it. his whereabouts. The film's harsh subject matter is so vividly realized by director Singleton, and acted with such great conviction by its cast that the film is deeply unsettling and at times unbearable to watch. If you can get past that, which is no easy task, you can appreciate what a sharp, well-crafted historical drama that this really is. *** is not a movie that many will be able to digest easy. It's a long and brutal picture. But one that is masterfully done in almost every respect and one that should brew a healthy, informative conversation soon afterwards.Starring: Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Bruce McGill, Loren Dean, Esther Rolle, Elise Neal, and Michael Rooker.

Donnie Brasco (1997)	"such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing. it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it. it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film. I don't know how much of it is true.Overall, this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition, especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie, as it shows a more somber side to this way of life, and I recommend it unequivocally. this is a ""based on a true story"" outing.Engrossing and eminently watchable, with first-rate lead performances and able back-up from Michael Madsen, this is an overlooked and extremely worthwhile film. The only complaint? Depp's first scenes, wearing the most fake-looking moustache in the history of the movies. But it detracts little from what is a highly skilled picture. So Fergeddaboudid! "	7.8	1

But if you're looking for big laughs, no matter how raunchy and profane, you will have a blast!  Don't leave this call on hold!My score:  7 (out of 10) fan of outrageous trash talking and completely random lines (""Was ya gonna wait till I turned into a butterfly?"" and ""You need a cigarette to bring you down?"" LOL!) then this movie is a must see. Otherwise stay away as this is going to offend and bore you.10/10 for some, and a 3/10 for others.  Watch at your discretion! because of that, the humor of this movie is universal. This is one of those unbelievably rare comedies that is funny all the way through. Not only that, there are so many jokes and gags, that you will probably miss some of them because you're too busy laughing at the last one. Excellent movie to rent for a ""stay-at-home"" date. show. He has some really funny, memorable lines, and is adept at physical humor. Even though the material is of an overtly sexual nature, the message of the film is definitely that monogamy is cool. A real over-achiever of a film. Was probably made on a shoestring budget, but delivers more laughs than any high-priced Eddie Murphy comedy. A must-see! think there are some very good quotable scenes in there as well. However, if you are actually expecting to see any nudity, there isn't any in there.  Excuse my stereotype, but because of the vast amounts of (not so subtle) innuendo and profanity, most women that I know would probably not find this movie as hilarious as I did. "	5.4	0
Boys Life 2 (1997)	"Philadelphia, and Chicago.  These films show the absurdities which gay people are confronted with by clueless straight people, and one film shows a glimpse of something most gay men never get to experience: the opportunity to actually date guys as a teenager.  These films are up-lifting and should make all audiences smile and rejoice, whether gay or straight. Life (I'm watching the series in order), which surprised me because reviews trend the opposite way. Maybe it's because the three great films in this set are about and for adults, more intelligent and creative than most. They don't fit too comfortably under the ""boys"" banner, though. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the series plays out. moving and realistic. Besides being moved, I found myself a little shocked to find myself feeling a little like the subject matter is dated when it is so obviously not.  Each of the four movies in the collection moved me in a small way, but Dadshuttle's the first thing I've seen in a long time that got me choked-up. short subject.  It's about a very young kid coming to grips with the fact that he's gay.  It's funny, moving and has a very uplifting ending.  A real winner.So, the first and last are the best segments.  The second is good but dark. And the third should be avoided.  Pretty good batting average I'd say. "	6.7	0
City of Industry (1997)	"of crime seemingly function within their own sect of society.  It's a part of life many would just as soon deny in reality, but as Steve McQueen said many years ago in `Bullitt,' `That's where half of it is.'  And a film like this is not about to let you forget it.  I rate this one 8/10. Night associates have deemed ""Keiteling"" (the mandatory Harvey Keitel emotional and physical meltdown, e.g. the church scene in ""Bad Lieutenant"") it doesn't get any better than this.  However, the film is quite violent, and I have not met many women who like it.  Still, ""City of Industry"" belongs in the collection of any fan of revenge-based action thrillers. ""City of Industry"" to settle a score with fellow thief Dorff in this surprisingly entertaining but gritty and violent action/drama from the same mold as ""Reservoir Dogs"". Janssen plays a babe (what else?) caught up in the vendetta filmed in just about every seedy part of Los Angeles. Good stuff for crime buffs and Keitel fans into violent gangster-type flicks. ethnic mix, with both Chinese and Black gangs playing a part as Roy hunts his man. Hutton, Stephen Dorff, Wade Dominguez and Famke Janssen contribute solid performances, and Lucy Liu is also to be seen. The movie may descend into too much mayhem for some; and the sunny epilogue seems out of place; but this is a must-see for thriller-lovers. can make it through the violence (it is brutal like ""True Romance"" - but not overly gratuitous - the violence is there for a definite reason}, i promise you that this film will leave an indelible mark on your mind and that you will never forget this film ever!  it is, without a doubt, a movie to be remembered.

Best Men (1997)	(and not so lovable) vibrant characters from nerdy little Teddy to Billy, the classical romantic hero, to Buzz the top-notch soldier with a heart of gold to Sol the lawyer you don't want to trust. Why had I never heard of this movie before?!? This definitely deserves a place on the shelf for anyone who loves comedy and good writing. draw you more into the story and Drew is believable as the bride to be and has a friendship with each of the 5 male stars. I seldom recommend movies, but this is definitely one I plan on seeing a few times just because it was written so well I know I probably missed a few things the first time. really liked this movie.  It isn't a vehicle for Drew Barrymore, if that is what you are expecting, but her part is one that she does well in.  Dean Cain also turns in a worthy performance.  I think most will be surprised at how touching and even moving this movie is if they give it a chance. the plot comes from the inevitability of the scenario, which in turn comes from the characters. If the resolutions are a little trite, its because its basically a tragedy played out on an action comedy set and there isn't time to beat about the bush. If you liked the wit and love of life in Strictly Ballroom, you'll like this. Shakespeare are extremely well chosen and just right for the movie. This, by the way, encouraged me to read Hamlet.The role of Drew Barrymore is small, but significant. It was quite funny seeing the whole public against the FBI. The ending was quite unexpected.Anyway, I think that this is a beautiful movie and should be seen with an open mind. 	5.7	0
Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996)	Kama Sutra, mind you the ART not the positions. Anyway, the film setting is gorgeous and the acting is superb. You'll recognize Sarita Choudhury as Tara if you've already watched Mississippi Massala. Indira Varma does an excellent job in expressing her revenge, regret, and mystery in Tara's character. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE did an excellent job in this film. The costumes and sets are really well done.  The cinematography is richly textured, with India as the exotic backdrop, and you are transported back into time... and into the lovers' experience.This movie can take you through a full range of emotions, see it with your significant other, and expect it to effect you for the rest of the night. and a good plot. I was captivated by the lovely erotic scenes.  Although there is a love story in it, the film isn't entirely an happily ever after affair. However, the ending retains the feeling of hope and the fact that love (though not necessarily the lover) survives all things.A sad, yet hopeful movie.  I highly recommend it. the historical setting, the costumes, the sets, the interaction of the characters, the dancing and the love story.  I also can't help thinking that Indira Varma is probably the most beautiful woman alive.  I found this film stunning, enjoyable and moving, and I highly recommend it to audiences who don't mind a little sensual nudity in their films. whole film just left me with a great feeling. I love Indira Varma, she is so beautiful and such a talented actress. The role of Queen Tara portrayed by Sarita Choudhury deserves mention also. I would recommend to anyone with an open mind. Though I was very young when I first watched it, it is for the more mature audience. 	6.0	0
Private Parts (1997)	"itself I guess).Overall this plays like a rude Woody Allen film (funny narrative voice-overs) and it has a certain charm to it that towers over the smuttiness to make it feel a much nicer film than it is.  Even if you don't know who Stern is (i.e. most people outside of America) this is a very funny enjoyable film. make some questionable decisions in his life, he always stood by those who stood by him, and for that, he should be admired. Whether you are a fan or not, check this movie out, and see if you don't come away from the experience with a smile on your face, and a respect for the self-proclaimed ""King of all Media""! cool 80s music and a damn entertaining comedy that will never tire out--""Private Parts"" is DEFINITELY worth seeing!!  If you're not a Stern fan, I'm pretty sure you'll be croaking more than a sick frog, so don't start preaching your blasphemous thoughts on Howard.  We really don't have the time.  My score:  8 (out of 10) guy who can do some outrageous bits. Some bits you like, some you don't.  The two thoughts that I was left with leaving the theatre is 1) he is devoted to his wife and family, 2) he is a success story despite so very many obstacles.  Love him or hate, all but the most prudish will enjoy this. It delievered on all fronts: writing, directing, and acting were all top notch. It left me dumbstruck that a movie with such lowbrow humor could hand out a solid emotionally driven story at the same time. I feel this has much to do with the mix of Howard Stern's raunchy humor combined with Betty Thomas' female touch. A terrfic film. "	6.8	0
Love Jones (1997)	and the dialog? Hmmmm, so stimulating. Makes me want to find love like that........ as those films explore desire and passion through words in addition to physical attractions. Recommend this film to the scores of filmgoers who missed its limited theatrical release -- better yet, serve it up as a first course conversation starter during your next gathering with friends.  It's sure to spark equally passionate discussion, and that's always a good thing. time I would watch it everyday it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do. Also, the character Savon could not had been any better dealing with the subject of marriage. We would all like to find a Darius out there but most of us just settle for watching this movie. My vote is 10/10 and crazy stories and philosophies on life. I love nights like that. To add to it, who WOULDN'T want to have the type of relationship that Nia and Larenz endured? Good or Bad...it was so sexy and warm and black and beautiful...Definitely a keeper, and PACKED with unforgettable quotes that ALL can relate to. Definitely somethin for the movie collection. As a matter of fact all of the actors/actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic-comedy from them. This movie can be compared to most any well-written, romantic comedy. If you have not seen this movie already I strongly recommend that you do, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love. 	7.5	1
Saint, The (1997)	is a delight to watch them realize that their skin deep attraction goes much deeper.  If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, the Saint is a fun movie.  Despite its flaws, the Saint is a guilty pleasure to indulge in when your own life is lacking in explosions, gun fights, and sudden, passionate romances. the story, well...I didn't bother to check for anomalies, I knew I'd find plenty. I only have two more things to say:1. Elisabeth Shue is absolutely stunningly beautiful in this film.2. The cool car that we only get to see a few seconds is a Volvo C70, a worthy replacement for the Volvo P1800 that Moore's Saint drove around in. interesting role that shows off just how good he can be; he's observant, yet unobservable; seductive, yet not a cad; confident but riddled with insecurities. Moreover, in the early stages of the film, British students are no longer misrepresented as drunken, whoring lay-abouts, but as attentive learners who actually show up for lectures. Impressive stuff.Yours Sincerely, A Proud British Student. so long enough to get a good plot, some twists & turns and yet not bore you. There will always be people that pick plot holes in movies and just love proving that it's road kill. If you're one of those people, maybe you should stay away, but if you want a good entertaining popcorn movie it's worth a watch. overlong though entertaining.

Billie is the Danish's best director, an expert on intelligent dramas as ¨Pelle the conqueror¨which took the best foreign-language film Oscar , ¨Twist and shout¨,¨The best intentions¨, ¨House of spirits¨, and ¨Les Miserables¨.

Despite its weaknesses it remained watchable throughout. It confirmed my view (based on 'Pelle the Conqueror' and 'The House of the Spirits') that Bille August is a highly talented director. 7/10 has to say the line ""There is no Mr Lubing. I am the bride of Jesus"", which just cracked me up, even though I think it was supposed to be a serious moment.P.P.S.--The absolute highlight of the movie is a little speech Smilla gives about numbers.

Jim Carrey's great comedy acting skills were a crucial element of this film, but they are not the only redeeming value of the movie itself.

Quiet Room, The (1996)	"are both.There is nothing cutesy here. The girl, a seven year old, has decided not to speak because of the conflict between her parents. That's essentially it. But there is so much in the honesty of the child's monologue that resonates with any person who has been a child trying to understand the irrational world of grownups.This film is brilliant. etc. This movie took me right back to those times, like it or not.I liked how none of the characters had names and also how small the cast was. The movie works because of how simple it was. I'm curious to see more of Rolf's films now, too bad none of the rental stores here carry any of his stuff. none of her parents understand.I was very touched by this movie this is a very great piece of work by Rolf, a classic, I'm looking forward to see ""The old man who read love stories"" and more of his work in the future.I'd recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, be warned though you have to be more patience while watching. child!It was great to see life in a not so harmonious household from the child's point of view! So many things I've heard myself say to my own child, the mother in the film said and I swear I will always think before speaking to my kids!It's a very original and thought provoking movie - I recommend it to everyone! like this?(This film is Australian made.)

Make full use of what you have and take your chance. That's what Selena did. She was loved by her friends and family and won the hearts of millions. Strongly recommended. Selena's mother, although she did have to deal with the question of appearing to age 15 years. Every cast member seemed right for their part, and everyone did very well. The film seemed well-directed, in that I never thought about the director at any time during the film. Overall, the movie was very sweet, with obvious tragic overtones. Highly recommended. played Selena's husband Chris Perez did really well too.After watching the movie and hearing Selena, (Jennifer Lopez was lip-synching to Selena's voice. I thought that was good too.) I am going to get hold of some of Selena's music. I hope her memory will live on forever. Selena, the movie is highly recommended. Whether you're fan or not, see it. super (as usual) as her tough-nosed father.  The rest of the cast is adequate, but the show is shared between Lopez and Olmos.  The screenplay is a little sappy, but fine overall. Director Gregory Nava is always focused and this keeps the film interesting throughout.  A fine film all the way.  4 stars out of 5. The actors playing her family are all great, too (especially her father). Ms. Lopez also has a sweet, natural chemistry with Jon Seda as Chris. Their relationship is so real because they were friends first...friends who fell in love.Ms. Lopez also does a great job lip-synching Selena's songs, and the ending will bring tears to your eyes.

Devil's Own, The (1997)	"story moving at all times and stages the action well.  Despite all these pluses, I constantly felt uncomfortable at the ways in which the script tried to manipulate my sympathies.  While it's not quite enough to make me downgrade the film on an enjoyment level, it loses big points from an ethical perspective.  Shame on you Tinseltown. a disappointment, despite its two major-league stars and its major-league director. This was the last film to be made by Alan J. Pakula before his tragic death a year later in a road accident. Pakula was responsible for some excellent films, notably ""Sophie's Choice"", so it is a shame that his career did not end on a higher note. 4/10 moralistic, cutesy-pie, boy scout character style which he seems to hide behind, and it's just ridiculous, and reflects really lazy acting (see: ""Air Force One"" and ""Patriot Games"", to name two). It is truly irritating and disappointing, and brought this movie way down in my view.I had trouble swallowing the premise, but Ford's performance just made this cringe-inducing to me. in Northern Ireland which do not dodge the politics and have sensitivity, but none of them have been made by US production companies.  'Harry's Game' is by far the best example, devastatingly accurate closely followed by 'The Children of The North' and the black comedy 'Divorcing Jack' more recently.  See these and give this Hollywood rubbish a miss. proposed such a story to the studio would have been turned down, and that would have been fortunate for all involved.In fairness to Pitt, he did try to walk away from the project, and in order to save face, ridiculed the movie before it hit the theaters, which suggests that he had more sense than anyone else on the set.

Otherwise, it'll just make you tired. Probably not everybody's cup of tea, but it sure is MINE!  An enthusiastic 10/10 stars! P.S. Did you know that Scott Bakula can sing? He sure can! wonderful film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh, likes cartoons, or Scott Bakula.  This is a charming film that encourages chasing your dreams, no matter how big they are.  As T.W. said, ""They can break your cookie, but you'll always have your fortune.""  Isn't that the stuff dreams are made of? voice cast is excellent. Other definite pros are in the surprisingly consistent and mature scripting, the inspired story, its constant sense of fun and the glamorous and irresistible choreography. All in all, despite the decent enough rating on IMDb(though I personally think it should be in the 7s) this is a very underrated and almost forgotten film. 10/10 Bethany Cox are animals) are drawn exaggeratedly and that fits perfectly for the theme and tone of this movie. ""Cats"" is a funny, wild ride for children and adults.  If you like animation and/or musicals and/or clever comedy, you'll love ""Cats Don't Dance"". It's a shame this great movie isn't more popular.  Hopefully good word-of-mouth (and word-of-internet) will change that. ultimate favorite scene was in the last number ""nothing's going to stop us now"" when they were in the ""venice"" scene...i thought it was the cutest, even if it was only a few seconds long! but it definitely was a cute movie, and my favorite of all time. this was a great movie. everyone, of all ages, should watch it.

B*A*P*S (1997)	on IMDB & other sources, is that the writers think that it has set back the clock for black actors etc.  It was directed by an African-American, which I may add, never received his just props in Hollywood.  In conclusion, if it makes you laugh, which the fine actors in this movie achieve whole heartedly, it's all good. with their heart and compassion for the man portrayed by Martin Landau. I took it as a modern day rags-to-riches story and I'm glad Robert Townsend gave us B.A.P.S. Some may have been insulted but I viewed the story without shame or indignation. Life shouldn't be taken so seriously that you can't find the humorous side of your own people. put together and has so many scenes that just make you want to smile through the whole rest of the movie, which I did, even if I was crying, and to this day, I have loved it ever since my first viewing. If you're not racist/sexist like a lot of IMDb, you can enjoy this movie, otherwise, just back off. proved that they were really Black American Princesses. And besides I love most of Robert Townsend's movies and this was just one of them. Halle and Natalie acted those parts out like they were actually living Nisi and Nikki's lives and I thought that was just outstanding. It may not have been a big hit, but it was to me. and the scene in the line for tryouts in the music video is nothing short of a gut-buster are only a smattering of the laughs you'll have.  It is a heart-warming movie that you can watch over and over.  PLUS, Halle Berry is such a BABE! So, lighten up and watch it... it beats the copycat 'Booty Call'. 	4.4	0
Love and Other Catastrophes (1996)	"Radha Mitchell. Set in a Melbourne University, Connor takes center stage in a tale of unrequited love and missed glances. The comedic element is often tempered with dark touches which makes a change from the usual limitations of romantic comedies. The end might be a tad obvious but it gels in well with the genuine feel-good nature of the film. best friend is gay, as I think would happen in most American films. The film student satires are a bit heavy handed, but on a whole it's a cute, funny first-time movie casually made.

Unlike the first film, this movie follows the rest of the series, it is set in the same universe with the same people, with the same sets, with the same suits...(Unlike the first film in which everything was different).Personally I highly recommend this film ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY to Power Rangers' followers, NOT to the general audience. that I provide ten lines.  Right, that appears to be nine, (ignore this, it displays differently when you're typing it in) so I'll just extend it a little bit more...............  OK that should be ten! No - They don't like that either so - What is an Egyptian King's favourite chocolate?  Pharaoh Rocher.  (Ben, aged 8). a scene explaining their new powers, but they cut that part out after David Yost's unpleasant departure from the series.To sum up, probably wasn't worth it to pay six bucks to see it, but it's definitely a must for any hardcore Power Rangers fan (especially since you kind of needed to see it for the TV season to make sense). the cars go together to form a giant robot. They then proceed to hit the guy once. Once with the sword. That's all it takes, and he blows up. I sat through that whole movie, and that's the end? They kill him in one hit? The fight was shorter than the robot forming sequence. There is no excuse for that. look as if they want to escape this atrosity. So I have one question. Why did they release this movie to theaters? This should have been released straight to video. Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place. This movie was totally inappropriate for the big screen. * (out of four) 	3.5	0
Anna Karenina (1997)	was used discreetly. Sophie Marceau plays a very young Anna, and makes her credible all the time. Sean Bean and James Fox, as Vronsky and Karenin, are admirable. And even if the screen play by director Bernard Rose is a little too literary, the complete story was told, and the result was the best Anna Karenina the screen has offered. Anna's husband is not a monster, for example, in this new version, but a rather pathetic, right-wing government bureaucrat with obsessively strict moral values. Moreover, the portrayal of Anna's behavior throughout the film, and especially in the final scenes, is a masterpiece of sympathetic psychological insight and understanding.This film is a  for the time being, anyway  neglected classic. my opinion. She is classically beautiful, and the right combination of all the elements that made her character.....chaste wife turned star crossed lover, strong, confidant woman melted to vulnerable young girl. I adored Sean Bean also. I found him totally believable, and I fail to understand how anyone even remotely interested in period dramas could fail to appreciate this film. time to put music and image together if they use classical scores (my favourites would be David Lean and John Boorman), and I believe Bernard Rose should be watched in the future.  I should love to see what he would do with a film set in late 19th century Italy, when opera was at its height!***1/2 out of **** fares better, if only because of the stellar performance of Alfred Molina. Offhand I can't think of a more underrated actor (save perhaps Ron Perlman). Ms. Kirshner was fine as Kitty, although her journey from infatuation with Vronsky to love for Levin was given short shrift.Overall I loved this movie, but I just wish it had been two marks better. 	6.4	0
Double Team (1997)	the rapid-fire approach, or whether he just didn't care about such details and wanted to keep things moving (Probably the latter, as his subsequent movie, Knock Off, experimented with this abstract, to-hell-with-storytelling visual approach to the nth degree). Whatever the case, the result is a pretty wild but somewhat confusing action movie that could've been much better with minor changes. martial-art scenes. However, it`s far from perfect.  The whole plot is very silly, there are huge logical gaps and holes in the story and Mickey Rourke is far from convincing as a villain. Double Team isn`t a film for everybody.  But it`s definetly worth to rent it for an action-fan. I give this movie 7 out of 10. of Hark's short-lived collaborations with Van Damme: He went back to Hong Kong and directed the incredibly awesome 'Time and Tide' (which did not feature Jean-Claude Van Damme at all).'Double Team' doesn't come to close to being one of Van Damme's best, and it might not even please hard-core Van Damme fans, but its all in good fun - 5/10 back, and still regret that fateful day. Only one other film has traumatized me to that extent (I payed full admission for Congo on the premiere...). Sometimes, no amount of comments will prepare you for a true impact of a film. Schindler's List, Kids, Saving Private Ryan, and... Double Team. See this movie, you will never be the same again. spectacular. A brilliant story line and Damme good action are what really bring this movie together, the action scenes are like watching Michelangelo's David take shape and all you can do is stand in awe at it's beauty. Van-Damme is a man on a mission, and won't stop for anything on this roller coaster ride of excitement, laughter, and adventure. 	4.7	0
Inventing the Abbotts (1997)	"don't remember any noise about it at all.  Excellent screen play with fine characterizations by all actors; absorbing story and a true-to-life story that hits home at any time. The era was well represented by costume and settings; one of those ""good little films"" that get lost in the shuffle I guess. Bravo to all associated. I'll recommend it! to invent whatever it is they need to hang onto.  At one point in the film, Doug says of his brother, `If the Abbotts hadn't existed, John would've invented them.'  And maybe that's the way it is; taking life as it comes and dealing with it the best way you know how.  I rate this one 8/10. She handled her role with delicacy and care, and turned what could be a fairly boring character to an interesting one. I love the exploration of family relationships, and I was glad to see a solid relationship between Doug and his mother.All in all, ""Inventing the Abbotts"" is a splendid movie that *somehow* teaches you to love ""no matter what"". much that is poignant and insightful and deeply touching in this entire piece that I would say that anyone who favors dramas with powerful romantic elements and thoughtful examination of the forces at work in society should make every effort to see this film. I do not know why it did not attract more notice when it first came out. Liv were so tender with one another. Both of them have the acting ability, where you only have to look into their eyes to know what they're feeling or trying to convey. For all the bitterness some characters offered, it was the relationship between Pamela and Doug that captured me.Just a sweet love story, and that can be OK sometimes! "	6.4	0

It's a big snake shaped tube and goes from slow robotic motions, to super fast CGI. Cube and Hyde manage some, at times, adorable dialogue. Voight's presence also unites the rest of the cast, and each character gets their own heroic captain moment. Fun filled and just plain bad. I loved it. here. Surely, the actors on hand have done much worse, and as far as horror/b-movies about snakes, you could pick up much worse yourself.

Cusack's buddy's coke-fuelled, paranoid banter was spot on (""Jenny Slater, Jenny Slater"") as was the burning the fingers on the furnace, to name just two random details. The effect of this, is that they all add up to a movie which you can enjoy watching many times. And that makes it a rare gem. and Mrs Smith has since explored similar territory of rich cosmopolitan assassins trying to blend into ordinary American life. Blank spends most of the movie in pursuit of Debi. Will she forgive him? Will he have time to complete his assignment? This is my idea of a great movie. It's funny and clever and the characters are flawed but likable. for my taste (a bit more on how Martin became accustomed to killing would have been nice). Still, GROSSE POINTE BLANK was one of the best films of 1997 and one of the better comedies of the 1990s. There were rumors of a sequel happening for a while, though the chances of that happening are slim to none. Too bad. "	7.4	0
Keys to Tulsa (1997)	"(Perhaps the plot twists were a little too challenging for them to follow.) The acting is great--especially Deborah Unger and James Spader.  And Mary Tyler Moore does a great holier-than-thou slut-turned-society-swell.  And Cameron Diaz is dead-on as a ditzy blind date.  And Joanna Going does a hot striptease.  And ... and ... hell, just see it. but I really enjoyed this flick.  I'm not nominating anyone for awards, but can't help but love the cast.Being a heterosexual male, I am in TOTAL love with Joanna Going and Deborah Unger.  SO SHOOT ME.This one's for fun, gang.  Not all movies have to reinvent the wheel.  So pop a cool one and dig in... ""comedy thriller"" - at least, that is how it comes across. In any case, it's not entirely clear - or successful - but the society ""party"" scene is funny, with Ms. Moore, Going and Josh Ridgway (as Billy) seeming to capture the film's mood.***** Keys to Tulsa (11/20/96) Leslie Grief ~ Eric Stoltz, James Spader, Joanna Going, Mary Tyler Moore and there's no apparent reason for them to have such similar-sounding names.) Overall, though, it works as kind of a slapsticky film noir. Mary Tyler Moore is a scream as Richter's mother, and Michael Rooker is reliably freaky as Richter's childhood friend. Give this one a shot. It's not what you'd call high art, but it's a lot of fun. she made this movie, as she looks more like 24. Adding more insult to her great performance, despite her large role her name nor picture is nowhere to be found on the region 1 DVD case from Artisan.

Kissed (1996)	had witnessed something important and special. It may be disturbing at times, but Kissed is never revolting. I would not have believed that a movie about this subject matter could be so beautifully and sensitively made. If you ever find yourself anxious about death or plan to die someday, I highly recommend this passionate exploration of our most primal fear. Outerbridge is wonderful, too. Recalling this film now, several years after first watching it, such a rush of thoughts and feelings come back to me that I will probably have to see it once again. If you are willing to go somewhere you never imagined you would find yourself--and then deal with what you discover there--KISSED is not to missed. I learned in the funeral service is that it is life that we deal with day to day, not death. It is helping the living deal with loss. That is love. If only there were more cerebral, psychological and spiritual movies that touch this topic but unfortunately we are left with gore!! Anyone know of any other movies like this? the way the subject was approached.  It wasn't vulgar, obscene or bawdy; on the contrary it was sensitive, almost romantic. One emphasizes with the main character, a girl who is attracted by dead persons. I felt seduced, almost hypnotised by many scenes.All in all a very special and an excellent movie, but one which may not be seen superficially. rather eloquent.But what I personally liked the best about it is how it figures relationships, elucidating the insane need of one not having the other have its own and private corner, the need of forcing the other to share it, and the woe that comes from not being able to stand it. In this line, necrophilia becomes just an excuse. 	6.5	0
8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997)	snigger. Joe Pesci is great as a Mafia man assigned to bring back the heads of 8 'hits' he has made on the West coast. Enter a medical student, with a similar looking bag, his girlfriend and her family and you have the recipe for good crude comedy. Worth checking out if you are in the mood for a chuckle. with its series of laugh-invoking antics designed to prevent innocent people of knowing what's in the duffel bag, while seeking to try to either get rid or exchange for the correct bags. Not a classic comedy in any sense, but one which will keep you laughing and smirking throughout, without resorting to gags all the time to make you enjoy. film stays pretty fresh (even though in truth it's probably 20 minutes too long).I'm quite a harsh marker, so a 6 from me is quite a compliment for a film like this. Well-written, nicely-paced, silly without being annoying, and containing some funny performances and a lot of good moments, you will like this one if you give it a chance. them. However, there were some terrific ones as well, the best perhaps is the dream sequence. I'm not going to tell what happened, but it is really hilarious. Overall I would call it an enjoyable movie when you are able to switch off your brain for once. I gave it a 6/10, which isn't bad for this kind of movies. film in a very superb way. The writing tells a story full of insane circumstances happening to normal, everyday people. The acting of the film, most notably that of Joe Pesci and David Spade, is such a huge part of the comedy that the film definitely couldn't have had otherwise. All in all, perfect writing, perfect acting. Watch and laugh.Travis. 	5.3	0
Hollow Reed (1996)	bad person, but they are drawn into circumstances that are psychologically damaging to all of them, particularly the boy.This movie successfully treats many themes: child abuse, the far-reaching and long-term effects of divorce, sexual discrimination, society's duty to children, and the suitability of gays as parents.At the end there is no nice neat resolution in this honest and realistic film. and still evokes a stunning portrayal. Angela Pope directs the film and its characters through many subjects that could involve several films, let alone one. The screenplay is sharp, the actors carry out great performances. Rarely, in a movie, have gay characters been shown to be so human, not a pasted cliche. Don't miss this fine motion picture. Highly recommended. moving drama. One is absorbed from beginning to end, and experiences a cathartic feeling at the finale.The only aspect which may date this film a bit is the British courtroom attitude toward the homosexual lifestyle. In that respect, it roots itself in the late '90s. However, even that element is historically honest and truthful.A fine film from English contemporary cinema. was really not much feeling of love between the two. However, I suppose that the relationship was done as well as could be expected, though. All in all, it was a great movie, and it's 'pros' far outweigh it's 'cons'.

Paradise Road (1997)	"The  realistic scenes of violence had a tremendous impact in contrast to some of the wonderful underplaying of the leading actresses, notably Glenn Close and Pauline Collins.   The Japanese actors, although unknown to me were chillingly effective.   I can only hope for more films of this calibre but alas they are few and far between. a heartfelt film with a profound message of hope which runs all the way through it. 'Paradise Road' is one of those rare films which reminds you of the indestructible nature of the human spirit. I wish there were more films like this one, and I wish more people had have seen this film. In a word it's a gem. about the women POWs of Sumatra, I suggest you read ""White Coolies: Australian Nurses Behind Enemy Lines,"" the diary kept by camp survivor Betty Jeffrey, or read the biography ""Bullwinkel"" by Norman G. Manners. There is also an excellent 1985 documentary called ""Song of Survival"", and a really tacky episode of ""Willesee's Australians"" that dramatises the story of Vivian Bullwinkel. itself, and the film, should be much, much better known.  It is also one of Glenn Close's best performances.  Her performance, and the film, itself, are absoultely gripping!  If you like true-life stories that are extremely well-done, such as ""We Were Soldiers,"" then this one is of a similar genre, but with the main characters being women. empathise with all of the characters (both 'Goodies' and 'Baddies'). You'll be left thinking very hard about the persons who 'did it' for real.In the middle of the film, when the Vocal Orchestra perform Dvorak's ""New World Symphony"" without instruments, and at the end of the film, ""Londonerry Air"" (Oh Danny Boy), a box of tissues may be required accessories.

Pat's relationship with Kate is treated as an afterthought, maybe a plot device to give him a reason to come back to the Travellers camp.Because of these flaws, the character development that could have been the strongest part of this movie never really gels.  The shaky plot structure, especially toward the end, compounds the problems. rarely if ever knows what he wants, let alone what he'll be able to possess.This movie tries to be a lot of things. And it succeeds in most. It is a road movie, a romance, a con, a story of failed redemption and more. It's a North Carolinian mafia movie. Sure it's not ""The Godfather."" But it ain't ""Mobsters"" either. the pair out on a gig.  Julianna Marguiles of ""ER"" also shows up as Paxton's love interest.  The acting is uniformly fine, the cheating schemes are twisty and unpredictable, and the story is nicely touching.  Though not without some ordinary moments (Wahlberg's romance wastes time, why the ultra-violent ending?), this is a fine sleeper of a film. fine acting and an interesting backdrop, you just keep getting the feeling that a lot of stuff was thrown together while the script was being written. Both of the quasi-romances are hard to buy, and the ending seems like a scene from the ""Death Wish"" series tacked onto a character study. Probably worth checking out, but not a great movie. However, it's Wahlberg who provides the uncertainty in this movie - he doesn't really know how he is playing his character. As for the much criticised turn to violence in the finale, it is indeed unexpected, but not altogether unwelcome and it makes for an interesting climax. The film is very good, but it could so easily have been excellent. "	6.2	0

The supporting cast is great, you cant go wrong with John Leguizamo, Michael Rappaport, Rosie Perez & Marissa Tomei. I definitely recommend checking this movie out, I think it will surprise you!

Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)	"a limo. Garofalo is a scream as their fellow bitter alumni. Kudos to costumer Mona Maya's outlandishly colorful creations, Robin Schiff's kitschy screenplay based on her play ""Ladies' Room"" and a waycool soundtrack of ersatz 80s tunes (best one: The Smithereen's ""Blood & Roses"" to start off the flashback). Directed in high comic style and snappish glee by David Mirkin. overall production values are very nice. But, most importantly, the humor is abundant and zestful. If you need to drop all your worries and get your fighting spirit back, spend an evening with the delightful Romy and Michele. They will make you giggle and get you ready to face the more somber world again with a renewed and optimistic attitude. be the most successful.Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow fit their characters perfectly; giving so much energy and naivety to them. Janeane Garofalo was great as the surly, fowl mouthed Heather Mooney and Alan Cumming as the nerdy Sandy Frink is also great.It isn't the best comedy, but its still a great watch. Makes you look upon your own school years. bimbo and its negatives and positives. Lisa Kudrow is especially comfortable in this role thanks to Pheobe.It's not exactly high brow humour, but the laughers and great characters of the 97 set picture not only bring back memories of the 1990s now but it also lets us all know that we shouldn't accept the crap of todays Hollywood. Brilliant [A] appeal to those who enjoy more cerebral humour, but the underlying, heartfelt messages, the effervescent performances from its likable (and luscious) leads, excellent support from Janeane Garofolo (as class grouch Heather Mooney) and Alan Cumming (as nerd-turned-millionaire Sandy Frink), and spirited direction from David Mirkin are guaranteed to provide a fun time for all but the most joyless of souls.

Temptress Moon (Feng Yue) (1996)	"emphasizes her special position in the family as well as her angel image. We often see the sexual victim as woman. As contrary, this movie describes a male victim from the sex abuse of his sister and his brother-in-law. The tragedy goes deeper when this victim destroys the others and himself. In summary, this movie is on my collection list. an ancient civilization.Cousins, brothers-in-law, sisters, then become embroiled in a sick game of love, lust, and revenge. This is a very sobering film yet hauntingly beautiful at times. All performances, from a radiant Gong Li, down to the smallest roles, are superb. The character development is profound, the story compelling, and the production values are stunning. A first rate movie. symbols snake by at first, yet come to how powerful meaning in the end, and they strike us at many levels in the movie, each time richer with understanding.  I left far surprised and impressed.  Finally, a movie great enough to express itself in humility of pretenses.  If only they'd ditch the stupid and coarsely sensual box. of contemporary criticism told in the form of a story happened decades ago.Unlike the story of Farewell My Concubine (Ba Wang Bie Ji), what reflected in this film is far too close to home: what happened more than half a century ago is happening again in China and the director was more direct in criticizing the decadence in this film. is a Capo or Dai-Lo of a Shanghai Triad after growing up in the Pang household.  Gong-Li lives with the duty a death has given her, after ""elders approval"" and must cope with her childhood friend & cousin as a lover and trusted adviser; while being courted by the returned from Shanghai Cheung; with whom she falls in love.

Volcano (1997)	"values?The lessons of this movie are quite clear.  1) lava is harmless if you don't touch it; 2) small children will inevitably wander into incredible harm (but emerge OK), and 3) only through the trauma of sudden volcanic activity will we come to appreciate the true Brotherhood of Man.Whoever thought up this movie should be thrown into a volcano... care in the world. And I do have to give credit where it's due; somehow the filmmakers managed to keep slow-moving lava exciting for 104 minutes. Plus, you can't help but get a kick out of a disaster film that includes the line ""This city's finally paying for its arrogance,"" and finds the time to include a Bible quotation. 7/10 concentration. Personally, I think this film is great. There are better films out there, including better disaster films, but there are so many films that are ten times worse yet get better reviews. That's probably because they have better actors or are more realistic - but the job of a movie is to entertain, and this film does that brilliantly. script is weak and cannot wait until the lava flows but even then struggles to make it exciting, throwing specific near misses at us again and again to keep us interesting. The cast have nothing to work with and make little impression but viewers may find this has just enough going for it to make it watchable if totally forgettable. drawn out save-the-daughter scene trying for maximum suspense.GOOD NEWS - Some awesome disaster scenes. Hollywood's special-effects just keep getting more awesome as the years go on. A fast-moving story that was just about the right length. A likable lead character played by Tommy Lee Jones.Overall, a movie that keeps your attention but doesn't get your respect with the dumb dialog. "	5.5	0
Children of the Revolution (1996)	"commitment, which was portrayed quite sympathetically; the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched, as were her son's struggles with history: both global and personal; all in all, a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic: a genre it's very easy to screw up and is rarely, if ever, handled as deftly as it was here. The interest is held with some superb acting by the cast and the idea of Stalin producing a child and ""heir."" The movie could use more of an ending, and it does treat itself as being ""true"" particularly at the end. Having said that this is well worth watching and I recommend it to anyone intrigued by Communism and Stalin. dialogue, in both its everyday scenarios and heated exchanges, is excellent; and the mockumentary style meshes perfectly with the nicely segmented, ever-twisting plot.  Then, after making light of some serious history, the ending takes a dark, ironic turn to drive home its message that whatever political system you choose, the worst elements in human nature are here to stay... mum he's a perfect child...always to be seen at manifestations against the Vietnamwar but then the nightmare strikes...Joe falls in love with a female cop! Really it's totally hilarious even if the personages always stay sober but it's the kind of script that leaves you not one minute in silence. A perfect film from a rather unknown director, see it!!!! excels at. If one enjoys dark comedy with a heady twinge of surrealism, you're really going to enjoy this movie. Our best scene (without spoiling it) is when the three start dancing and handing out flowers, with Louis Armstrong crooning Cole Porter's ""You're The Top"" in the background. My friends almost fell off the couch with laughter. It's a gem! "	6.3	0
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)	"many people who completely missed the boat on this one just because they pretend that the movie is something that it's not and was never meant to be. It's true that the movie is immensely immature and that it has unfortunately little re-watch value (one of the biggest problems with the film), but the quality of the comedy is unmistakable. the like the TV-program ""Laugh-In,"" but with a dumb story.I have no complaints looking at Elizabeth Hurley (""Vanessa Kensington"") and Michael Myers (""Austin Powers""), with his crooked teeth, stupid grin and ridiculous sayings made me laugh. This is a very fast-moving film, a spoof of James Bond and a spoof of the crazy '60s. The 90 minutes go by quickly. will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically, these two guys are symbols of American film, at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed. The laughs never stop as Myers entertains in two pivotal roles. Hurley is sexy as Austin's partner and love interest. Robert Wagner finds ways to make fun of his ""It Takes a Thief"" character and is very entertaining in the process. A quickly paced film that generates constant laughs with each viewing. A sequel is soon to be released...Yeah, baby! endearing characters in Powers and his nemisis,Dr.Evil.When certain characters inspire imitation (and who hasn't at least heard imitations of these two,or perhaps even Robert Wagner's character, Number 2 and others),then you have done something right.This movie is good for it's amusing characters and good story line,but again I think it would have worked without so much vulgar humor.Worth a look.

Breakdown (1997)	will happen next! I must also compliment J.T. Walsh for giving a great performance as Red Barr, and Rex Linn for his great cameo as the police officer. You know how sometimes you start playing with your phone or keep looking at your watch? Oh no, not this time pal! Great acting, great action, great plot, I'm loving it!! 10/10 again. Why can't actors do what he does like this anymore. Good performances all around make this a tight entertaining watch that you will feel you have not wasted your almost 2 hours. A fast paced thriller that hits the mark at every turn. See this one and you will see how the 90s had great suspenseful films lacking today. very enjoyable. J.T. Walsh is suitably menacing as Red,in my mind, but this IS Kurt's movie through and through. Mr. Russell has to be one of my favorite actors working today. And this film has to be one of the best 'Chase for family member' type movie in the last decade..HIGHLY recommended My Grade: AWhere I saw it: HBO plus Russell is outstanding as the bewildered husband seeking his kidnapped wife, and yes while it reminded me of the superb Dutch film The Vanishing (the original 1988 version not the terrible Hollywood remake), and at times Spielberg's Duel, it still has a real freshness about it, with some great photography and direction.Well worth a look, possibly Russell's best performance. 9/10 aside, what Breakdown remains ten years after is a competent, un-pretentious thrill-ride where the dialog is never too heavy, the action is packed with real stunts and few special effects, and some of the brighter moments for Russell in recent years (or rather, the last ten). It knows what it is, and has the professional temerity of a cult effort. 	6.9	0
Broken English (1996)	"run by Nina and Eddies's employer, with the characters involved verging on caricature. But the main theme is that youth will do what it's going to do (sex, mostly) for good or ill and the oldies might as well stand clear. A nicely made and well paced light piece from the producers of the rather more serious ""Once Were Warriors."" so Broken English still comes out ahead of more traditional movie fare. Perhaps it's because this movie comes from the producers of ""Once Were Warriors"" which is one of my favorite dramas of all time. Watch for the romance between Nina and Eddie (played by Julien Arahanga from ""Once Were Warriors"",) Ivan, and Martin Csokas' portrayal of Ivan's menacing son. in the real Romeo and Juliet days. Frankly, I found the movie boring, but women would probably like this movie a lot more than men, if the language didn't turn them off.The scenery was nice but I wasn't surprised at that. I have yet to see something filmed in New Zealand that wasn't beautiful. That must be a great-looking country. the two main characters is well-handled, it seems to be the only thing the relationship is based on; we don't really see them get to know each other.  The two main characters are appealing, and the two actors who were in ONCE WERE WARRIORS(here playing brothers instead of father and son) are both good, but it still falls short. Were Warriors, Broken English scores with great acting and has a much better script.  True to life, the movie doesn't offer simple answers for the problems the cast deal with.  If you're a fan of viewing different cultures, you will most likely enjoy this movie.  I enjoyed this movie much more than the other two listed above. "	6.5	0

The writer-director of this film poses thought-provoking, eternal theological questions (""If God is able but unwilling to prevent evil, isn't it logical to assume He is malevolent?""), but perhaps lacks the courage to follow his premise through to the end.     (**) brother-in-law makes his relative very aware of. However, in the end things do not remain the same for arrogant in-law. Nor for the man who lost his wife.

Courtney Cox is also a very beautiful woman, and it is a great pleasure for my eyes to see her good performance on the screen. This film is not indicated for all audiences, since it plays with religion. Some persons may feel offended with the jokes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Quebrando os 10 Mandamentos' (`Breaking the Ten Commandments) enough for this sort of unassuming film that tells a story in its own meandering way.  Courtney Cox finally comes out of her shell, finally playing a likable character, and she proves a worthy receptacle for most of the camera's adoration.  All around, a good date rental for those who won't be put off by the sacreligious plotline. a forgiving God in the way he allows him to get a fresh start again. "	5.6	0
Ripe (1996)	"to the girls. While the movie is intense in several parts, I think the fact the girls are actually in the right age groups as the characters really throws me for a loop. Casting them was daring and edgy, and about time to do something like that... nobody is right in this film, nobody wins, and everyone loses something... Q real emotion. As studies of young sexuality it's inferior to the underrated Adrian Lynne Lolita. And as a story of young girls made old before their time it pales in comparison to Manny and Lo.I guess I'd probably give it a 3.5 outta 10 because I've certainly seen worse films, but I sure can't think of much to recommend it. for the outlandish. Either way, this is a movie that must truly be seen to be believed. After two viewings I can't really say whether I like it or dislike it, but I can certainly recommend it to viewers as a film unlike any other. Besides, if it airs on The IFC, it's got have something going for it, right? of this movie is the army base on which most of the action takes place.  I understand that the US military has suffered some steep budget cuts over the last seven years, but I doubt that any army base in the nation is as poor-looking or completely lacking in discipline and protocol as the one depicted in this film. and ending up on an Army post so dilapidated no Army would want it (yeah, right!). An apparent attempt at a coming of age flick, ""Ripe"" is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere.

Overall though, this delivers enough Gangster stuff to be Entertaining and should have a more accepting approval than it does from Critics and intolerable nit-pickers. the acting is good, especially from leads, Gallo, Williamson and an evil Kiefer Sutherland, who clearly enjoys his role as the psychotic Curtis. It's just a shame that the plot seems to run out of steam for the last 20 or so minutes but it does come together again for an exciting finale. Well worth checking out. Sutherland also directed. way he acts and talks in presence of Vincent Gallo, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kim Dickens.  The cast also includes two very small roles, one for Rod Steiger and the other for Martin Sheen who are both in top shape.  But the movie belongs to the four young people on the run who act out the movie to perfection. Mirman's plot keeps the action moving, presents twists at every corner and establishes engaging characters.  The real key is both Sutherland's own frenetic performance, his directing style and the chemistry between Kim Dickens and the superb Vincent Gallo.  A rare treat, with characters you can root for from the very start.  Has a great little soundtrack too! 	6.3	0
Turning, The (1992)	"local chanteuse, Glory Lawson (Karen Allen). Everything is predictable; everything is glacial; everyone manages to turn in the worst roles of their careers (and everyone except Anderson had already turned in pretty long careers by this time). Please, for god's sake, avoid this film like the plague. By far the worst thing I've seen this year. (zero stars, of course) sense of tangible menace. The rather so-so domestic tale of a bunch of estranged rednecks; they could easily be guests on the Jerry Springer Show under the title ""My Son Is A Nazi"". Not bad, not great, this is a film that has ""average"" written all the way through it. Just one question  why is it called The Turning??? in the movie for about 5 minutes.  This movie was so boring that it had me wanted to fast forward to the scenes with Gillian in them.  I can't believe Gillian ever even got another role after appearing in this sad, sad excuse for a movie.  I am now dumber as a result of watching this film. at times! Michael Dolan, Tess Harper, Karen Allen, Raymond J. Barry, and Gillian Anderson all give exceptional performances.

The viewer ends up wishing, however, that the producers would have shifted some of their money away from sets and special effects and into a script and direction. it was edited by a Cuisinart. The over extended climatic fight scene had so many different editing styles present that it nearly gave me an epileptic fit.

There was also a fair amount of pathos running through the film which made it into just the kind of happy/ sad mixture that I love.This was no Oscar nomination, but good, clean, harmless fun. Enjoy! from them.  The two guys don't always seem secure with the material, and rightfully so, like with that lame running gag about ""the whirl.""  Nevertheless, ""Fathers' Day"" is a delightful comedy and it definitely has its moments.  Some won't be as satisfied as others, but I myself was satisfied.  My score:  7 (out of 10) a bit more. The jokes do fall flat at times, but the direction is nice (Ivan ""Ghostbusters"" Reitman), and to be honest, I had fun watching this movie. That's all I really ask for in some comedies.(Also note a cameo by Mel Gibson, who dropped by the set during filming of ""Lethal Weapon 4"" at Warner Bros.!)3/5 stars -John Ulmer Robin being featured.  We expect more from them and, when the writing doesn't support the capabilities of the actors, the results are exactly what we see here: Mediocre schlock.Since Reitman was the director, that lit a (Ghostbusters) bulb; I can see Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd doing a better job with it.. or even Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis. slowly drink his coffee. Robin Williams is the improv master. It's fun to guess which lines were written in the screenplay, and which ones just came from his head full of characters.We know everything will turn out OK in the end, but there are enough unexpected twists and turns to keep the story interesting, and some pretty funny minor characters.

I loved the music, partially because they used Engima and Vangelis.

Some good one liners and physical comedy but you *have* to see the police line-up scene with John Witherspoon.

Mozart that plays insistently throughout, are beautiful and cloyingly seductive.

Love! Valour! Compassion! (1997)	"a must see just because it is not a strident, political rant against the horrors of AIDS. The characters, especially those played by Glover and Alexander, accept their fates with great dignity, humor, and valour. This film is a great tribute to all our victims of AIDS, and a silent condemnation to the society and politics that let it happen. other; but they nearly all care about one another.  This is the kind of movie that makes you reflect on your own human interactions.  You don't have to be HIV+, a choreographer, a yuppie, a broadway queen, or even gay to see yourself in these characters.  This is a fine exhibition of love, lust, friendship, and life. the film shows a bunch of gay men dealing with AIDS, sex, love etc truthfully and with great humor. The best performances come from Alexander, Justin Kirk, John Glover and Randy Becker. Also the film has plenty of casual male nudity (especially Becker who is handsome and has a very nice body). Worth seeing...especially if you never saw the play. are most scripts based on plays AND adapted by the original writer. I would be very inspired to actually see this performed.""I am sick and tired of straight people, there are just too many of them. I was in a bank the other day, they were everywhere writing cheques, two of them were applying for a morgage, it was disgusting."" Bobby Brahms, showing why he won the OBIE Award for his spectacular performance.  The cast also includes Stephen Spinella, two time Tony award winner for Tony Kushner's masterpiece ""Angels in America"", Jason Alexander, and many other actors that deserve much more recognition and fame than they currently have.This is a beautiful film with precious characters that you will love.

Shall We Dance? (Shall We Dansu?) (1996)	"what? I think so because now I'm really geeked to give it a try. Watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again.Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is. nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their ""Oscar"" awards. depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it.The dancing was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it. Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.All these makes it a moving and fun film to watch. you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really ""alive"", learning to dance as the film goes on.Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars.And yes Aoki is funny :-D in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.

Second Jungle Book: Mowgli & Baloo, The (1997)	"itself, and those adults who would wish him ill. It belongs in that category of serious movies that star children, but are not just children's stories.This story was not one of Kipling's best, in my opinion. It is rather fantastic. For his best story made into a movie, I refer you to ""Captains Courageous"" which was filmed in three versions. and added some gentle depth to a little boy who was the product of animal care taking.My family enjoyed this movie.Clearly a story this simple is not meant for those persons who have left the bigger part of their childhood essence behind; however, it is highly recommended to anyone who still enjoys tender child fare: clean, wholesome, gentle and enjoyable. Weismuller? Watch this movie as an antidote to the dreadful cartoon version of the novel, with the singing bear. It is an extremely realistic portrayal of a feral boy, his jungle friends, the jungle itself, and those adults who would wish him ill. It belongs in that category of serious movies that star children, but are not just children's stories. the idea of them being exposed to such rot. This may go down in movie history as Roddy McDowell's ""Trog"" ; the unlamented last film that Joan Crawford made.Bad story, badly written, poorly acted, chimpanzees _in India_, rewriting Kipling - it never stopped. I can't think of much more to say, but the system requires additional lines. Pass it up. it is a hodge-podge of Kipling's plots. But, man, is it beautiful and that little kid is so good and believable as Mowgli. Without being true to any one of the books, it seems to me perfectly true to the spirit of Kipling. The cinematography and the beautiful animals are, in themselves, worth the price of admission. I loved it! "	4.5	0
Twin Town (1997)	"Adie. Although a very seedy picture of Wales is presented, this presents a very positive view of the people of Swansea and manages not to be anti-English in the slightest despite the obvious nationalistic feel. The acting is great, and as long as you aren`t expecting anything like Trainspotting and you let the humour wash over you you`ll enjoy this. thinks he is the man but is actually very accident prone at most times and that's what makes him great amongst other roles.This is a so much happening here and we should look at this for what it is which is a feel good film that starts you off straight away and doesn't let you stop till the end credits. bits that are hard to catch if your ear isn't tuned to the accent. Sure it helps if bad language doesn't get in the way of enjoyment, but let's face it, you should be used to those Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic words by now - so if you can handle it, this one's a delight - but it'll never be mainstream. comparisons to be made, both should be viewed as independant films, and to link them together does the would be viewer no justice. Twin Town has all the elements of a great movie, Comedy, Drama, and in combining these,the viewer cannot help but become attached to the characters. This film made me laugh, gasp and cry.A stroke of Pure Genius. with nearly every recognisable Welsh actor in it, this is a dark, funny, and entertaining film. The script is fresh, and the plot is good. And as the caption on the sleeve states, the film DOES ""raise an index finger to Hollywood"".Rating? nothing short of perfect 10! Go and see it NOW! I promise you, you will not be dissapointed! "	6.7	0
Addicted to Love (1997)	minute, wishing him all the worst the next.  This is crucial to the story, bringing me to the conclusion that it is Tchéky that really makes the whole film work.  One could criticize that even though the idea is original, the story isn't, with no unexpected turns or twists along the way. Simple, but pleasant film.  6/10 title Robert Palmer song adds to the reckless, but endearing epitome of the film. The directing styles aren't amazing, but they're hip and stylish for the most part.Overall, it isn't film of the century and is far from outstanding, but `Addicted to Love' is original, entertaining and very funny for the most part. I give it 6.8 out of 10. should have been made clearer, since he sleeps with her whilst pretending she is Linda whom he still loves. Although good, perhaps this scene could have been cut as it is confusing and largely irrelevant.The rest of the film was OK, the pranks were cruel but effective. More focus should have been made on the relationship between the two leads. the revenge seemed too mean-spirited, and some of the sweet moments seemed out-of-place.  BUT, even with that big of a problem, I still enjoyed the film.  It was consistently funny and entertaining, and Broderick and Ryan both gave good performances.  The best performance, however, was by Karyo, and he was probably my favorite thing about this movie. this show didn't get as much recognition as it should have. 	6.1	0
Brassed Off (1996)	it's strictly on video, is likely to come from very strong word of mouth. I had been told how good it was and enjoyed it immensely. Now that I've seen it twice, and thus been twice moved, I wait for a reasonable time to pass so that I may watch and enjoy it again as I am bound to do. much to see and love about this film, regardless of your political beliefs.  Music does matter, but the people who create it matter, too.  Communities matter, love matters.  This is what good filmmaking is all about.  See this film.  You'll laugh a bit, cry a lot, get angry, become sad; but, you'll never be bored. ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film. the structure of the film (although it was dramatically more satisfying than the Full Monty). Gloria was unconvincing; the wives were underused, and the speech at the end, yes, I found it embarrassing too!But please, before you attack the veracity of such a rounded and honest film as Brassed Off, take the time and trouble to watch it properly first! having fun in difficult circumstances. And you really can't play wind instruments drunk, I've tried.The film is not perfect. It is a bit preachy, especially the end. And McGregor's accent, although he plays the part beautifully, does slip at time, especially in his longer speeches. But the humanity of the film and it's charm out way all of it's faults. 	7.1	0
Designated Mourner, The (1997)	"himself into believing HE is what they admire rather than the money and power. So the Lothario, yet in reality, couldn't please a woman with a 10"" vibrator and a million dollars in cash. Yet we have to listen endlessly to his sexual imagery that would turn-off a cat in heat. I am going to go load my gun now. the lack of action: yes, maybe it's really a radio play, but every actor or actress should *see* Mike Nichols, who gives an extraordinary, one-of-a-kind performance. Particularly, he breaks all the rules of ""actor's diction,"" so he sounds just like a *real* person (say, being interviewed for a documentary). Not an effect you can use just anywhere, but brilliant here. to stop from sleeping.Worst film ever made. don't accidentally watch it, hire it etc. It really is not worth the effort. If however you're planning to rob a bank, show the workers this film & watch them nod off. This really is a film to kill yourself to. Dull Dull Dull. PS. no this is not highbrow - it's tosh. soon the real movie would start.  Soon my jaw literally started to drop open as I realized this was it.  12 minutes was all I could stomach.  Afterwards, I sat there dumbfounded that anyone has the audacity to make this and call it a movie or that anyone could actually sit through this let alone enjoy it. of almost any movie, but 10 minutes into this one has tried all my patience.

Ponette (1996)	" These interactions are so authentic that the storyline as such becomes a secondary consideration.  One reviewer critized the 'fantasy' ending of the film saying that it somehow broke the flow of the story...But, I for one appreciate the fact that the creators of this film allowed us to regain our composure before the lights went back on ! spraying lemon juice in her eyes, no one is tickling her feet...SHE is doing her own work. It's like she is channeling the next incarnation of Meryl Streep or someone. Since ""Ponette"", she has done two more films, including ""Chocolat"" (1999) with Juliette Binoche. She is now only TWELVE. I should live so long as to follow her entire career. role religion plays are brought into focus in this outstanding, thought provoking and unrelenting heartbreaking film.  Death and religion are difficult enough concepts for adults but to thrust them upon a 4 year old child and watch her battle to understand why her mother is dead is captured beautifully and thoughtfully in Ponette.  This is a must see. only tell you that if you are looking for something intense and engrossing, this would be your movie. I really appreciated the feeling it left me with at the end too.....that life is not always easy and predictable but that humans are remarkably resilient beings who can actually grow in wonderful ways from the events that challenge us the most. the important award recognized the biggest achievement in the film: Victoire reacts with amazing naturalness and outstanding facial expressions to the most intricate scenes. ""Ponette"" is a film that certainly will be in your memory, mostly because of a too young girl who shows the difference between a little great actress and a gracious child who wrinkles the eyebrows eloquently.

Schizopolis (1996)	"tells them, in a very disturbing level of honesty, indicating what they're really feeling and really thinking, and how they express it, whether truthfully or dishonestly. Among things, the film is hilarious, frustrating, shocking, spontaneous, and even touching. It's like nothing ever put up on the screen before, it's a fresh antidote to anything formulaic, and for once, something new. he achieves that or not is open to debate, but he certainly managed to create a one-of-a-kind film experience.  Too bad few people ever got the chance to see it on the big screen.In the immortal words of Elmo Oxygen:  ""I believe -- so strongly -- in mayonnaise.""  Words to live by.

Some very funny situations and lines. Not for everyone, but for those looking for something different and willing to keep an open mind this is an excellent, original film. If you want loud bangs and shiny things, watch Soderberghs other films like Ocean 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 etc. Re-watching this almost on a whim, and it all comes together (such as it is) even more. This is truly hilarious, a comedy masterpiece reveling in all its many absurdities, which come one after the other at a highly accelerated rate. I'm upping my vote from 9 to 10.""You will learn something from me here today."" --Elmo Oxygen (Noooo!!! Oooogghghgh!!) "	7.0	0
War at Home, The (1996)	I rate this 1996 film a 10/10 a superlative piece. Highly recommended especially in this day and age with again, our country embroiled in a hideous war, our headlines shouting of atrocities and again, our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of deeds done in the line of honor. A must see film. what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war. The story felt realistic - it isn't mushy, but made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez were playing father and son - it made their relationship more believable, than anything Hollywood can conjure up.  If you're in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off...please check out this underrated gem.  Hopefully, one day Martin and Emilio will unite with Charlie, and they will all make a great film together.  My score:  9 (out of 10) bloodshed, it makes us understand why so many youg men had flashbacks of what they had been thru.The dialog is particularly gripping, and gives us an idea of what went on in so many families in the aftermath of Vietnam.I wish there were more good movies like this one, not just about Vietnam, but about other social conditions as well. it all - a real sense of a family trying to keep up appearances - which is so well-established that the film's explosive finale is all the more shocking. This is a different and very effective presentation of a Vietnam veteran's experiences. Don't hesitate to check out this movie, which should have received more attention back when it was released. 	7.1	0
Rough Magic (1995)	spider.  In this movie, just about anything can happen!  Love is magic but love can't happen with bitterness in the way; likewise, magic can't happen without love. The actors exuded the '40's style with finesse with the witty lines, and Bridget Fonda's costumes were exciting.  I will surely watch this movie again and share it with others. spend an hour and 45 minutes out of your life. Besides, it's got Russell Crowe in it. in some ways, and far more fake in others. I definitely recommend this movie if you've got netflix or the like, it's a good movie to zone out to, but I'll tell you what, I had the urge more than once to have a smoke. I guess that's what one would expect from a movie set in the 50's. Enjoy! is a funny, sophisticated piece of fluff about losing and finding one's heart. Russell Crowe looks young and sweet. The Mexican Spanish spoken is entertaining, and Peploe's use of Mayan Indians and a kind of eclectic shamanism mixed with magic rings emotionally true. I loved this film and you will, too, if you are not too hung up on logic. the run, and quickly becomes very surreal.  I liked the characters, but the story wasn't quite strong enough to hold it all together, and it dissolutes almost completely at the ends, as if they ran out of ideas and decided to end it.  Still, it's worth watching for the bizarre spins of events and some very funny moments. 	5.5	0
Trial and Error (1997)	as amusing, and the romantic interest was endearing. Especially enchanting was Charlize Theron, as waitress Billie Tyler, as she was cheerful, kindly, and even brave (when she thought she had lost her boyfriend to a rival).  Yet it was she who innocently caused the whole problem - by serving her own alcoholic cocktail!I'm putting this movie among my favourites. a Ron Popeil Infomercial if Rip Torn was prominently involved.Jeff Daniels gets it done as the schlub lawyer who likes his chicken salad with mustard, not mayonnaise. Finally, we have Charlize Theron at her absolute apex (lookswise, not as an actress...clearly). You just knew it would lead to bigger & better things for her, and it did.Worth checking out. RIETTI!!!!! All said and done, Micheal Richards kills it in this movie... Some people have said that he still is trying to play off his role of Kramer but what we must understand is that regardless the role Micheal Richards constantly brings his own personality to the characters he plays and I wouldn't have it any other way. See it. Twice. revealed to be different than who they appear to be.This is a wonderful movie, which raises important questions about the veneer most of us use to hide our real selves. Like most good comedians (e.g., Robin Williams, Steve Martin), Michael Richards is also a fine actor, and his closing argument in the case is an especially masterful piece of acting. Austin Pendleton plays his typical character, goofy yet professional. The whole movie is very predictable but the actors that are cast keep it interesting. Recommend watching it without great expectations. So for a relaxing afternoon stick a bag of popcorn in the microwave and rent this movie for an hour and a half of a good story with entertaining acting. 	5.7	0
Buddy (1997)	"times in a row. She helped to develop the ""modern"" pet foods. Since before then people just fed their pets scraps.Also just one more minor note, my family is Jewish, yet in the movie, she wore a cross, and as far as I know, no-body in my family was paid or had given permission for the movie to come out. long in a drowsy, monotonous pace that could even put a few children to sleep.What could have been an eagerly acceptable fantasy with touches of engaging tragedy is an elaborate and fancy bore. BUDDY isn't a failure, but it fails more than it succeeds. At best, it's a promise that never really got off the ground.Rating: **1/2 out of 5. he was met with that frightened him. It was just cruel when people threw things at him. It very much saddened me when the inevitable happened. I cried and cried. I do not understand anyone who does not love this movie. The only thing I can think of, is that if you don't like this movie, you don't like animals. a baby and has such abnormal behavior, preferring animals to children? How far this movie is based on a true story? With regard to the film itself, the production is not bad, but there is not ""heart"" in the direction and interpretation. This type of story is usually very well developed by Disney studios. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Buddy"" but the only adversary is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't. Not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity. "	4.9	0
Con Air (1997)	in their roles, Colm Meaney is as always amusing. Malkovich and Buscemi are creepy enough but not the flamboyant psychos they could have been. Ironically, Cage has exactly that type of charisma (remember _Kiss of Death_, _Snake Eyes_, _Face Off_) but is forced to be restrain himself as the stolid ex-Army ranger.Finally: what the HECK does bruckheimer have against Corvettes??? These are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this film an just have fun. It's a great action flick that deserves a look and a better rating! Come on, let go and have fun. Grab the popcorn, because you're going on a ride! 9/10 You also wont find such a huge assembly of stars in most other movies either. The same guys wont shy to display their attitudes as well. The story is good and the action is even better. The cinematography and screenplay are also top notch. This movie was a box office hit and I can't understand why its rated so low? of all ages and genders!!!! prison plane which is also carrying some very unsavory characters (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi among others).  Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day.  Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters.  4 out of 5 stars. 	6.8	0

It's hard to play this story out without making some aspect of it melodramatic: but I give the cast an ""A+"" for making me care how it all would end.

A useless film I'd have forgotten by now if I didn't take notes. when you watch this movie.  Yes, it is worth watching to see the mastery of a lacklustre novel by a director on top of his form.

The filmmaker doesn't succeed in creating the suspense and he even can't create a disturbing atmosphere. The end of the movie falls into the ridiculous when the ship is entering the dock and destroys everything in its path.At the end: one of the worst sequels ever made. worst.  De Bont never gets up a decent head of steam and he shows his inability to inject drama out of his own skill - anyone can point a camera, not everyone can (or should) direct. A dull 2 hours later, I was wondering why I wasted my time with a film that was so clearly all at sea. on board, since oil isn't flammable at all. anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo, and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats, leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre.

I showed a clip of this film to my film school class and I had so many people come up to me afterward wanting to know where they could get a copy as well! Highly recommended to anyone questioning their sanity! lacks the pretense of would-be ""Artsy"" independent films to which we are often subjected.  Adrienne Shelley (the film's writer/director/lead) has a sly sense of humor, and her love of New York and ""real conversation"" is palpable and hilarious.  Here is a talent who finds the art in real life.  Worthy of eleven, if not one hundred, stars. more entertaining than half the full-budget crap out there. And to think that she made it herself. Her on-screen persona is more serious than she is: I love her quick retort in the bonus intro, in response to 'where she got the money to make the film' Adrienne turns to the camera, flashes an impish smile, and says: ""Investment Bankers!"" her in disguise, as she is across the street from where she has witness two murders. ""What are you doing here?"" he asks. ""I'm investigating,"" she replies. ""Shouldn't you leave that to the police?"" he responds. ""This is New York City, Adam; you know we don't have any real police."" A very well written effort by a true comedic talent. at the age of only 40. It is too much like fiction becoming fact. I don't imagine Ms. Shelly's surviving family can bear to sit through this film, which seems like a gruesome prediction of what actually happened. For those less susceptible to the trauma of subsequent real events, the film is a quiet delight, and very original and imaginative. "	6.5	0

The worst sin a movie can commit is to be dull, and that's something BATMAN never does. about what happens. The movie is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end, and is enjoyable for all ages. If anyone is going to complain about who was chosen to play Batman, there is much more room for complaint among the film's several sequels. Keaton did a spectacular job that no one has ever even come close to. strength and can fly, but Batman just needs himself.

This is what makes this a fantastic movie with many highs and lows. Mainly, a great story of love, friendship and adventure. has similarities with films like Harold and Maude, Freeway or Mad love. But despite of the fact that it isn't original, it still remains (in my opinion) a beautiful little gem. The music was great and David Arquette, Brad Hunt and Kathryn Erbe (and the others) showed some nice acting. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this film! in the bar my dad worked at while they were filming this, and saw him play the glasses as such, and decided to put in the 20 sec scene on a whim. They also got his last name completely wrong in the credits. It's Engel, not Ingalls. But nonetheless, it's a wonderful and moving film that I would recommend highly. happened to Cathy Moriarty and the girl from Rich in Love (the one with the black hair); they must be pretty picky as they don't get many roles.

For Roseanna (Roseanna's Grave) (1997)	"beautifully acted and superbly filmed. And best of all it is good, clean entertainnment.  Director Paul Weiland is sufficiently confident in his cast, his screenplay and his abilities that the story is allowed to take centre stage. There is nothing gratuitous, nothing formulaic about it Roseanna's Grave, it is a film of the old school: honest and genuinely entertaining. she did. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, touching, funny when it needed to be. And yet another good movie with Jean Reno. care about the characters.  If you feel disillusioned with blockbusters or just need a bit of cheering up after a hard day, this is your movie.Amazingly, it couldn't get a cinema release over here, and it is very little known.  My advice is to try it, and soon, like me, you'll be recommending it to one and all. holding back a tear in equal measure.The farce scenes rival Feydeau at his best in the likes of 'Hotel Paradiso', slapstick with style. Yet Reno as Marcelo, ably assisted by his comic ""sraight"" partner, Mercedes Ruehl as his wife Roseanna, also produces a pathos for the tragic circumstances which underscore his credentials as a very fine actor.Unmissable.

Head Above Water (1996)	enjoyed the performances in this film. Harvey Keitel again proves his tremendous range. Cameron Diaz is a very talented comedic actress and her makeup is very skillfully applied in this film. Billy Zane is again a third wheel (see Dead Calm and Titanic) but this time it's a comedy. The plot twists and turns are great fun to follow. 8/10. Cameron Diaz really make this film come alive and as incident after incident fall upon the hapless couple, you feel yourself gripping the chair more and more, your nails getting smaller and smaller, and the enjoyment increasing and increasing.All in all, Head Above Water is a great film, with good (if not at times, erratic) directing, and with superb acting. you in another direction. It plays great as both a Mystery and a Comedy, although the comedy is quite subtle. Anyone with a taste for mystery and comedy is in for a real surprise. Even if you aren't into those genre's, you'll still enjoy this great film. It would be extremely hard to dislike, because it's just so much fun. story unfolds. It has a twist that you never see coming. The writing is great. And another thing I find interesting is how a story with only 3 people in it can hold the attention of the audience. That says something great about the writer. HEAD ABOVE WATER is a story and character driven movie that I'd recommend to anyone! a special touch to the Wilson's movie. Reccomended to all 	6.0	0
Hercules (1997)	"kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!Overall - 8/10 with questionable motives.  The set-up and plot is typical for the movie but the script, animation, and music are most original AND good.  IF I had to register a complaint, I would say that it's perpetual humor kept the movie from being emotionally wrenching.  However, this movie remains one of the most entertaining I've seen.  8.5/10 style of Greek art, which may not be to everyone's taste (very similar situation to Sleeping Beauty which was disliked by some because it was animated in the style of a medieval tapestry), but it works wonderfully for the film.Take a chance and watch it...and when you're done watching it for the sixteenth time, go out and buy the soundtrack! Hercules"" is a cracking Disney film and for once it's not just for the kids. The animation is more like the ""old-school"" Disney, before the cute, big-eye syndrome and the characters are hugely entertaining. It has sly humour and in-jokes, but what sets it apart are the songs; soul, RNB, jazz and not a drippy sugar-song in sight. Quality entertainment! bombarding of wit keeps things from getting too touchy-feely. Besides, tied together with a golden Disney score, who couldn't resist a dose of adventure, heartache, redeeming love, and most of all, heroism? Just let yourself be carried away to ancient Greece and you'll forget the movie's problems in a Pelyponnesian minute. As the Muses would say, that's the gospel truth. "	7.3	0

With scores of music from folks like, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Tyler Bates, Ella Fitzgerald and Charles Mingus, this soundtrack is sure visit any jazz lovers CD player often. not afraid to put on the extra pounds for the role..he looked like a loser barfly.. a very lovable one..This was a very overlooked film..that many people have not had the privilege to see...If you want to see Keanu Reeves ACT..see this film..Stephen Kay did a wonderful job..he captured the spirit of the time in the language and the cinematography. 16 year old girl friend Cherry Mary. I won't go into anymore details as I think the less you know about a film before seeing it the better - but suffice to say that if you have any interest in the beat generation, or enjoyed any of Kerouacs books you'll like this film. Cinematography and music are both also exceptional. produced by the big studios becomes marketed ad nauseam over the course of decades. Stephen T.

At the same time, it has some genuinely poignant moments. Don't let it pass you by. hope bad things happen to her to punish her for her crimes.

Shinya Tsukamoto is one of the most inventive directors alive-- you never know what abomination he's going to create next.  And Tetsuo: Body Hammer might just be his best film. effects are unique and uniquely unreal, as they were in the original. This is one filmaker's nightmares rendered real. These two films, along with Lynch's Eraserhead, are the real deal. The cutting is fast so as to cause many (already extreme) shots to register on the subconscious more than the seeing eye. It will haunt you. Very highly recommended indeed. what the heck; If you took a boiling pot of water, threw in an episode of the INCREDIBLE HULK, added a tablespoon of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and mix it with generous portions of THE TERMINATOR, you would have TETSUO 2: BODY HAMMER.

This film centres around the hopes and desires of one character in particular (Chloe), but the backdrop is a vessel for expressing changes that are affecting real people in Paris. An interesting, arty approach to a film about the search to find oneself, and come to terms with an ever changing world that one may feel at odds with. search for Gris-gris takes us across rooftops and down alleyways to no avail and we ourselves become totally involved in the cat's whereabouts and hope he has come to no harm.  It's amazing that such a simple theme can maintain our interest for 90 minutes, but undoubtedly it's the authenticity of the characters that makes this film so enjoyable. the film. Someone mentioned that the film was depressing and nothing is further from the truth.If on the other hand you are looking for over stimulating, over polished, over scripted and ""smart"" film then this may be a bit of a letdown. I can imagine people who are too used to Hollywood disliking this film.All in all - strong 10/10. I see a movie but Garance Clavel will certainly haunt my daydreams for a few days... Credits to the other actors, especially Zinedine Soualem and Renée le Calm. This is a warm, sparkling and very true movie about real persons and real emotions, (and therefore) sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. A movie that makes one run out the door and ... Renée explains that Gris-Gris has fled. Chloe searches the neighborhood and finds solidarity with her neighbors. ""Chacun cherche son chat"", a.k.a.

Also, you gotta love the sharp contrast 3/4's into the movie, with the kid listening to sugary pop-music, while people are shooting intensely at each other. Great film. I recommend it to any fan of John Woo, Nicholas Cage, John Travolta and action films. 8/10 film's story as absurd and far-fetched, or you'll buy into it and go along for this supercharged, over-the-top action extravaganza. Travolta and Cage are both extraordinarily good, and with Woo at the helm you know that you'd better hang on for dear life! Occasionally silly, with a plot that tosses credibility out the window, but still lots of fun. *** Gina Gershon, and Alessandro Nivola add so much, you get into the film entirely.This is a very scary movie. This is identity theft gone terribly wrong and beyond any borders. I loved this movie and any other film fanatic will definitely enjoy it as well. It has great action, drama, romance, and dark comedy that bring together a terrific film.10/10 daughter looks good on screen-but that's about it.Joan Allen as his wife is not too impressive either.Gina Gershon as Troy's lover seems much more real in comparison.John Woo provides the film with a novel and flawless script,and some of the best action sequences ever filmed.This film is an absolute must for any action fan,and definitely the best Woo ever made. heartless to fully engage the audience's sympathies, and there's nothing here that matches the scorching human drama of, say, BULLET IN THE HEAD (1990).

At film's end, Godard, the uncle, is sitting alone with a book, overhearing a rehearsal of Mozart in a different room (""too many notes, they said"").

There's some good ideas, and some tasteful music, going all abound in For Ever Mozart, but the lack of cohesion becomes staggering. pearly, mystical clarity of his images and his sounds--the latter appearing both more naturalistic and rhapsodic than ever--Godard remains a world-class master.

The energy, silliness and pace of the film will make it a winner for children and it serves well as a distraction if hardly a great film for the ages. little to do though, but Ruby Dee and Francis Capra give entertaining performances. But for me, it was Kathaleen Turner who stole the show, as her performance is delightfully wicked and so captivating as the villainess of the piece.

I won't spoil the many surprising treats by giving any of them away here but I will say that if you're a fan of Preston Sturges, this movie is his unlikely Aussie bastard child. is so bright they seem to compete with nature itself - they uplift and enlighten.  Love Serenade, with it's repetitive Barry White underscore, its dead-on ""this is not an act"" performances and above all it's eccentric, unforeseen dialogue, plot and visuals has been added to my list of all-time bests.  There's so much to learn here about art. up having picnics in windswept Rotary parks, riding about dusty streets and choosing between the ABC and one other channel, this is definitely worth a look. Miranda Otto as Dimity is solid enough, but the character of Ken Sherry makes the film - a reptilian, tai chi following, Hawaiian shirt wearing DJ that will make you cringe with laughter throughout. daring strange then stranger end.Brilliantly written and directed by Shirley Barrett 'Love Serenade' is a great example of one persons vision being crafted and produced by a competent team that have taken on a singular vision. Its curious ""fish"" diversions and irratic surreal moments will have a large audience drop off, leaving a faithful few that will love it forever.10/10 good. My favourite shot - the wedding dress run across those wide, open grain fields.Clever direction tells you things without the clumsiness of deliberate speech e.g. keep a look out for the wheelchair in the lounge of the sisters' house, it's one of the few clues you get to their former family life.Wonderful performances, music etc etc. An Aussie Classic.

The beginning is bad, and the climatic battle at the end is overblown, which weakens the movie.  Still, it's worth a look, and I maintain Moore was only given a Razzie Award for this movie and performance because of her past work, and the naysayers really weren't paying attention to her performance here. great support cast and a perfectly despicable villain played to the hilt by Anne Bancroft as a Senator who compromises GI Jane for her own political gain. Well, at least she tries. I think Demi Moore is one of the most underappreciated talents in recent memory. She has this unique combination of hardass determination and sensitivity that is rare. 9/10 intense. It reached it's peak and stayed there- No cool down or another, higher peak. Cons: At a certain point it's not exciting as it first was. The finale wasn't that exciting either. Plot feels too simple at times.Pros: Great acting Best feminist propaganda I've seen in years Funny, wholesome and badass moments. many of them (and maybe too many) but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool.Overall, I highly enjoyed ""G.I. Jane"". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray. "	5.9	0
Conan the Barbarian (1982)	have gotten a little older and wiser the film has gotten richer and more rewarding with each subsequent viewing.This is a film of great resonance and subtlety. Most audiences today cannot appreciate a film that requires a bit of deep thinking, but this is one of the rare films that is even more rewarding if you look beneath the surface. Thulsa Doom, rivalling Darth Vader himself. A last point in this film's favor is the score.  Basil Poledouris turned out his best score ever for this film: Brooding, powerful and operatic, it lends the film a grandeur Hercules could only dream of.  I must have seen this film 40 times and I still never get tired of it. costumes, props and art direction are all top-notch. They could take all of the dialog out of the movie, and just have the music and pictures and it would still be worth watching.To fully appreciate Conan, though, you have to watch it and then watch another barbarian-type film from any era (Beastmaster, Krull, etc.) and the difference will be stunning. a little prayer to his god, Crom. This prayer embodies everything that Conan stands for. WHAT A PRAYER !!!. 2) The sequence thats starts from Conan's return to the Tower of Power to confront Thulsa Doom all the way to the end. It is wrought with meaning and some great cinematography. This movie is an absolute must see. 10/10-Celluloid Rehab was going to be a stupid Arnold muscle movie (it seems almost everyone thinks this) but she loved it.It's such a change to see such an un-ironic passionate movie. I can't see a movie like this being made today. The nudity and violence were great and added realism without ever being flatly gratuitous.Don't see Destroyer though, that was absolutely awful. 	6.9	0
George of the Jungle (1997)	"hero, though her squeaky voice is at times too cute. None of the other characters disappoint. Both Mann's parents are great in supporting roles and Lyle as Mann's nasty fiance is sensational.Kids will love this. Adults, I think will find a lot to enjoy in it also, but don't bring along any cynics. They'll miss out on all the fun!! spectacular!Just watch it with the whole family. It's really fun. I promise. what you get with any comedy. Disney has this in the ""PG"" mode so we get some of the standard peeing, farting, sex jokes and innuendos, kicking people in the groin....you know, all those supposedly-hilarious gags that have become so commonplace in modern family comedies. There is enough original material in here, though, to enjoy this a couple of times. movie and can be viewed by the whole family, the movie was quite funny.  Not Naked Gun funny, but still funny nonetheless. It is definitely worth the price of rental or purchase, so long as you like silly/unrealistic circumstances, talking animals, etc.For those of you keeping score, this movie was much funnier than Dudley Do-Right, which had some similarities. ass narrator, George getting hyped up on coffee, the women at Ursula's party fawning over George's deep spiritual connection with animals, George swinging into various objects (most notably the San Francisco bridge sequence) and George's climatic battle with the poachers.""My noble kinsmen, thou has served me well.

Cop Land (1997)	it. Cop Land is probably the second best police murder/crime drama I've seen, only behind L.A. Confidential. At times the story has something to be desired and unlike L.A. Confidential is drags in some parts but the fantastic performances by every cast member more than make up for these minor flaws. I give Cop Land 8 stars out of 10. police Department.Because of an accident while saving someones life he is unable to pass the medical to get in the NYPD therefore as a sheriff he is not respected amongst the population of the town.He learns that an influential group of cops are crooked and are planning to kill to save their own necks. Totally Gripping. 8 out of 10. a fool, the results are explosive. It's well written, with a strong storyline, great dialogue and excellent performances all round (especially from Robert de Niro, Keitel and Ray Liotta). But it stands or falls  on Stallone's portrayal of the central character, and he rises surprisingly majestically to the occasion. A very restrained, sensitive performance in a cracking good film. drowning when he was a kid, but he lost his hearing in one ear as a result and could never join the NYPD -- that's a powerful subplot that could have been more fully explored, but only at the expense of the main plot. All in all, a much better film than reviewers thought when it first came out, IMO. Do you think that it's an accident that his performance overshadows De Niro's and Keitel's appearences?I believe that if Stallone did a movie like that right after his first 2 triumphs he could be leading a career similar to the one of De Niro's. But unfortunately, to all of us Sly's only capable of throwing hand grenades. Right Leonard Maltin? 	6.9	0
Event Horizon (1997)	to watch a scary movie and been upset that it was...scary. Perhaps the movie was accidentally placed in the children's section.Regardless, the movie is fun and scary. Exactly what most people look for in a scary movie. I highly suggest renting this gem and enjoying it for what it is: One of the better horror movies of the late 90's. only did the film mix two mediums almost perfectly (sci-fi and horror), it completed the union almost flawlessly. Not a perfect movie, but then again, Sam Neill was amazing in this film. Virtually all of the technical aspects in the film were top-notch. While it didn't advance the film industry overall, it did make an impact in the sci-fi genre. the audience and provokes them to curse in awe. Every time my mates and I watch it, we are gobsmacked in its craziness! 10/10 - Easily in the top 10 horror films of all time! One of the most entertaining movies ever made. Paul Anderson has never surpassed this film and it will be the one he is remembered for. of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie, you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!! depressing endless terror, you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs, you'll probably dislike it.For the best experience, watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.Rated 7/10 on IMDb, but I personally would give it a 7.5/10. 	6.7	0
Spawn (1997)	"as it should. And yes, I know it's a Hell-based movie, but the metal soundtrack just got distracting and annoying, instead of enhancing the story like it should have. John Williams or Danny Elfman it wasn't.Need to see the film? It's a great visual ride. Just don't expect much more than that. It did make for some cool toys, though. down to the opening and ending credits.In the end, the film teeters between being something that's ""so bad, it's good"" and being just a good film with some unfortunate flaws, but in either case, it's still very enjoyable to watch. You just need to approach it not expecting a realist dramatic masterpiece, but rather with a love for the absurd. amongst 90% of the great CGI and make-up, the battle in hell is painstakingly terrible. They should've gone with an elaborate set and CGI here and there, but it becomes hopeless so you have to sit threw what you would call a lackluster climax.But for what it is, I highly recommended this movie for its dark humor and awesome action. wind up thinking too much about Death's sweet release.Like I said, I really wanted to like it. I watch it when it comes on FX or whatever other TV channel just to see if I can find a reason to like it, so maybe I won't feel the disappointment I felt the first time. It never works...and it never will. them were excellent and half of them looked like beautified Sesame Street animations (the demon ""thing"" of hell, for example, which had me crying with laughter). Let's hope for the next Spawn movie they take a few chances and make a grittier downbeat tale with more in common with the original comic and not like the muppet show from hell. "	5.2	0
Air Bud (1997)	"likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy (may this wonderful dog rest in peace, wherever he is now). Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield.Title in Portugal: 'Air Bud'. too much thought in this movie I guess, but it's just so bizarre that I've always found it very entertaining. I've learned the sequels actually stretch the premise even further and involve dogs that can play soccer, baseball and volleyball, but this one will always be the one and only original ""dog does weird athletic stuff it can't possibly do""-flick. movie, right? a basketball-playing dog is magnificent, and Buddy is an irresistible golden retriever, he makes the film as watchable as it ever will be.  You'll cry, you'll laugh and you'll be weirdly uplifted, but don't expect to be absolutely spellbound with Air Bud. But I do still recommend it, that's for sure. I rate Air Bud 7 out of 10. being properly trained and all, the only thing I feel that's a little far fetched is the poor dog wearing those tiny dog slippers tell me how a golden retriever is gonna run up and down the basketball court in sneakers,, but other than that I really just loved this movie,, it's a movie for all ages 9-99. enjoy folks.

Picture Perfect (1997)	"actually fall in love with her.The title derives from the fact that she works at a picture agency, and that's where a lot of the film's scenes take place. It gets a little weary after a while, and is very predictable - but if you're a fan of the actors, it's reasonable to say you'll find something to enjoy here. and not realize the little things in life that are free and in abundance for us to receive and enjoy  if we would only open our eyes, pause - truly listen, and let the heart do the rest. Trivia: There was a play on the movie title as it first appears and appears again. Ha! Have fun and enjoy. Aniston here, or may be you don´t because she is too much Rachel. I liked her because she is. Kevin Bacon was a little disappointing in a role that might be too easy for him and you will like Jay Mohr. If you want to feel good and sleep with a nice feeling, you might want to watch this. 6/10. liked it, since I am a 50 year old man and do not normally care for 'fluff movies'. The acting by Jennifer Aniston and John Mohr was very good, and the film gives an overall positive message for us all (Hollywood style, but it feels great). Watch it with someone you love, or if you have a warm romantic heart. thinking she's ""stable"".Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her.Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless.Don't be tempted to watch this.

In the Company of Men (1997)	"one. However, while Glengarry plays as more of a character-driven mystery and morality play, In the Company of Men is much more insidious, and it offers no solutions in the end.  In fact, the final shot of the film is, in my mind, one of the most memorable in modern cinema.  Just who exactly has the upper hand?....9/10 of the most chilling characters I've ever seen in movies.  Where a lot of movie villains ""indicate"" to let you know they're just acting (which does work when it's done right), Eckhart gives away nothing, so you never know what he's thinking, even if he tells you what he's thinking.  I hope he goes on to bigger things. you could empathise with them or consider their behaviour as anything other than abhorrent.  I thought that the snapshot of the corporate male dominated workplace was fantastic and the picture it painted of testosterone charged males excellent.The ending was amazing and I recall leaving the cinema and not being able to speak for a full 10 minutes.See this movie.9/10. the six weeks with a title and a burst of chaotic music. There are a few memorable scenes towards the conclusion of the film. The film focuses on the dog-eat-dog materialistic corporate world, and some of the envious and vindictive people that exist within it. I don't want to reveal any more, but I recommend you see this troubling film. and popular.  The other is less than popular and tags along for his ""therapeudic"" plan to put a woman through romance-related stress to relieve them of their woman troubles. The result is a haunting, realistic wake-up call.  From it's disorienting opener to a truly disturbing closing shot, ""In the Company of Men"" is a truly important motion picture. "	7.2	0
Free Willy 3: The Rescue (1997)	was a caring, compassionate person who loved his son.

No, this movie will inspire your kid to do good with his life, it'll make your child appreciate the beauty of animal life. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you watch it asap. It will appeal to people of all ages. are annoyed with Jesse's sudden seriousness.  Here's a hint: He grew up, as most people usually do over the course of four years.  Why do you think that there was a new discontented kid? I enjoyed how the movie stands for change and reformation, and how it states that even as old stories are lost, new ones begin. all-time family classic. Anyone must realize that whales (and others animals) can be more human than people.My rating 9,5 out of 10. The movie is dedicated to memory of Keith A.Walker (the man who brought two great characters Willy and Jesse into our life). IMDb is a great source for any movie lover but some ratings can be exceptionally misleading. how he has grown up and it is good to know that Jesse and Randolph will always stick together to do what is right! If you passed on this because you were afraid that it was more of the same, guess again!  It is another wonderful story that deserves to be enjoyed again and again!  Check it out!!! 	4.7	0
Career Girls (1997)	after they graduated Annie returned to her hometown and now 6 years later she's visiting her old friend in London for the first time in those 6 years. Re-uniting with old friends is something that has happened to all of us and always brings back the most bittersweet memories. This is a beautiful film and I recommend it to everyone. my mind with more impact than before; to me it now resonates as a meditation on the need to get on with one's life, and the costs (in friendship, soulfulness, caring) of doing so, and the tragedy of those who just can't make the jump. Not one of Leigh's greatest films, but like everything he's made, well worth the time. so well when directed by Mike Leigh.If you fond of films containing humorous British nostalgia and are fed up with the false, glitzy, Hollywood -influenced exterior that seems to be the winning trade mark these days, then this is the sort of film for you.Let's see more films about REAL life, warts and all, (like this one) for a change! short span of the film, much like a rose blooms in time-lapse photography. It's a helluva notion. Leigh accomplishes it all brilliantly.We have all seen buddy pictures, and Career Girls is no 48 Hours, or Lethal Weapon. It's a truly sensitive look into the human soul, the human heart portraying a friendship we only imagine.This film literally leaves me breathless. interested in it.  It turned out to be a pretty darn good little movie and I am glad I stayed up to watch it. Although it is a little different and a little slow, I thought it was a genuinely good movie with some very powerful performances.  The characters are strong and the story is simple, but sweet. 	7.2	0
Conspiracy Theory (1997)	copies of the same book over and over again is very poignant, indeed.  Mel Gibson put a lot of energy into what was obviously a demanding role and, as usual, Julia Roberts lights up the screen in every scene she's in.  The film might be a fantasy, but it's the sort of fantasy many of us can appreciate. But it was so completely different from what I thought it would be and it actually ended up being a better film as a consequence. Mel Gibson played a completely different character than what we usually see, which worked to his benefit and Julia Roberts proved with this film, that she still had star power.  Definitely worth a look. that fine line beautifully.  Despite all his craziness, he is totally likeable and his relationship with the Julia Roberts character is wonderfully complex and believable.  Julia Roberts also gives an excellent performance and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.All in all, I loved this film and didn't understand why it was so underrated by the critics. played.  He did it so well & the audience sympathized with him completely.  Julia was good too.  Her role wasn't really difficult to play, but she made it believably nevertheless. Patrick Stewart also stars in this.  He made a great bad guy.Overall, this movie was great.  It was very suspensful & the acting was outstanding. you will love this film. I have one thing to say about this film... Mel GIbson.  He plays a paranoid, noble, apparent stalker, who has intelligence and wit,but lacks ability to express himself fully.  Can't say more because it might ruin the movie.  CONSPIRACY THEORY IS A MUST SEE.  It ranks in my top 25 category 	6.7	0
Desperate Measures (1998)	"solid performances as well.It was nice to see a tough-but-loving father (Garcia) go to any lengths to save his kid. Speaking of the kid (Joseph Cross), they show this very little soft-spoken boy that is trying be saved and all of sudden he says the word ""a-hole."" What is the purpose of inserting that? Only in the world of film. have some plot holes (okay, Garcia can't kill Keaton. But why can't he shoot him in the leg or something?), and the last 20 minutes are pretty overblown, but the concept is thought-provoking and the filmmakers deserve credit for avoiding a cliched moralistic conclusion; indeed, the final scene of the film is very amusing.      (**1/2) he says or does is what a young child his age would actually be thinking or saying. I am not even really disappointed so much with that, but his delivery was terrible. I know he is just a kid, but there are much better child actors who could have portrayed this much better. All in all, worth about a 7/10. in. And as he looks like a 'fitting' candidate, he convincingly brings himself to the forefront. Again, once it looks good and everyone is vulnerable, Keaton's- Peter McCabe, focuses and attacks, leaving his surroundings and the area he was occupying, in a state of debris. And when the fight is fought and it looks like he is defeated think again...(***) The locations and presumably some sets are effective as is the dialogue and general situation set ups. It has great stunts, some by Keaton and Garcia themselves. The movie has not been well received by jaded critics who too easily criticize the formula elements, in my opinion.  It has the high production values often found in many such films. "	6.1	0
Steel (1997)	"Roundtree looking round, hands in the air, proclaiming ""what?""The special effects are reasonable for tv movie land, but, as this is (pinch me, I must be imagining it) a real cinema movie, they're quite cheap. Steel is badly written, contains atrocious dialogue, is poorly acted, shabbily directed and with an overbearing, repetitive musical score. It is, of course, tremendously entertaining. the world from an evil supervillain. Pretty standard superhero fare.This movie has earned its place in my heart alongside other bad movie classics like ""cool as ice"" starring vanilla ice. A must-see for bad movie buffs. Some folks who like superhero films might like it too since it's mildly diverting and quick-paced. Those who relish quality cinematic experiences should avoid. Despite taking place in 1997, the police are driving cars that look like they're from the early '80s. Just another sign of the shoddy production, I guess. The whole thing looks cheap like it was produced by the dollar store. I suppose there is some unintended comic value of the ""so bad it's good"" variety. But mostly it just stinks. ""Barb Wire"" is actually better than this, because I could laugh while watching it. This film is so bad it reaches a certain quality of lousiness only reserved for the very worst of bad ideas. I mean - Shaquille O'Niell in a steel suit with a super weapon made from the contents of a lost-and-found at the scrap yard? Please! ESPECIALLY Shaq??  The effects are not-so-special, and are in fact quite terrible, which is ironic because so is the plot, the acting, and generally everything else in this so-called movie (read : vehicle to make some money off Shaq's name).

Even the acting talent seems all at sea and unsure of where they stand or who they are. A load of rubbish with little or no value. her social standing are supposed to have happened in between; nevertheless, only her clothes and her makeup have changed. How can that be? I am not the same as ten years ago, and not so many things have happened to me. Also, she's supposed to be the pivot of the whole conflict, but she's not solid enough to justify that. Sounds like those two should have shared that cell at the sanitarium.Many of the character interactions didn't make sense, the story had ample amounts of LAME, and the funniest part was the very very end where we see the 'happy couple' and their two loser buddies DRINKING and DRIVING down the road in that stylish 1968 Buick Riviera.  Classy. indie movie, but as an hour and a half Hollywood flick, it's a complete waste of celluloid. I watched it (sporadically) on tv for free, and I still regretted it.

It is a very stylized presentation and the obvious attention to detail to create the look and the feel of the period help intensify the viewing experience.I am quite proud of the production and highly recommend it become part of your movie collection.

What I got was a cheap overated mockery of great television.  They turned the show into a complete mess.  The characters, with Eddie Haskell as the one exception, were not even similar to that of the TV show.

Mimic (1997)	"The direction of Guillermo Del Toro is tight and well-paced. The only real criticism I have is there are a few too many convenient chance meetings and a few too many instances of people being in the right (or wrong) place at the right time. Also I felt the movie was just a little too quick in unveiling its mystery. themes. The creature designs are fantastic, with the ""mimicking"" design being the most impressive.Of course, the plot is somewhat predictable, and the ""don't tamper with nature"" subtext is as conspicuous here as it was in Frankenstein (1931), but predictability isn't a flaw here, and Frankenstein was a masterpiece. Mimic has an absorbing story, with likable characters and suspense to spare. the men in the movie.   Sure there are some silly gimmicks in Mimic, but overall the plot is far more logical than virtually every so called science fiction movie made in Hollywood.  In any case the music, sounds, effect, the sets and the insects are superbly done. I give it 10 out of 10 for its genre. support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary).  But the director is the real star adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.Overall a superior creature horror film. and it was more interesting and credible than I expected (then again, science was never my subject).  The second half of the movie is pretty much a chase movie, but that's well done for the most part, though Charles S. Dutton wears out his welcome pretty quickly in a thankless role.  Sorvino is as good as I expected. "	5.9	0
Money Talks (1997)	"The audience is made to feel that he does what he does because he has to.  In his situation, I don't think many people would do otherwise. While he does take things to extremes, the movie wouldn't be as fun if he didn't.I would recommend this movie to any comedy fan, ""buddy movie"" fan or fan of the actors. he reminds you of Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop. Charlie Sheen also does an impressive job. The action scenes are not spectacular, but it does a good job.Money talks is a good blend of Guns/Explosions and laughter. If your a fan of 48 Hours, Nothing To Lose or any other Action Comedy, Money talks is a must see. 7.4/10 of the jokes that Chris Tucker made I laughed at.  He proved once again, after Friday fame, that he is a great comic.  Charlie sheen does really good in this one, too.  Overall the whole movie is a great comedic flick and I definitely, definitely recommend this to the average person.  Rating 10 out of 10. funniest man in the world! I love his movies, and in this movie people get to see what they love, pure Tucker at his best of high-pitched motor mouth ways. I love his Scarface impression, it shows his comedic talents. It is definitely time for Tucker to take over where Eddie Murphy left off. Hail the new King of Comedy!! together. Truth be told, I'd actually never heard of Vic Damone until I saw this movie.OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that Chris Tucker just gets the same role in every movie. I still consider him funny, and I wish to assert that ""Money Talks"" is good for a few laughs. Worth seeing if only for that. "	6.2	0

Don't go into it expecting too much, and you'll have fun with this little bit of fluff that far too many people have been scared away from because of the bad reviews.  Just give it a chance.  Trust me. that made it even hotter! I noticed there was a comment on imdb about the writing being sophomoric (or something to that effect), specifically the line, ""Do you like my tummy?""

Kull the Conqueror (1997)	"the constant screams ""waaaa-wa-wa-wa-wa!!!"" of that heavy metal guitar, briefly punctuated by your standard grade-Z fantasy film dialogue. I laughed my arse off throughout the entire film and had a great time. Anyone who takes this film, or themselves, too seriously, will hate it. Anyone who knows how to kick back and enjoy fluff, will have a grand old time. the red-haired witch Akivasha who cannot be killed, for she is living in a fire, is brilliant. Her immediate transition from the enchanting beauty to screaming rage compares to nothing. I still didn't figure out why Sorbo chose the same profession as De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, but he's passable here. Give it a try if you like the genre. ok, I know, you're not supposed to compare this movie to the Hercules series, but please, Sorbo's acting style is unchanged. Kull kills people in this movie and he's not a half-god, but that's where the differences end. This movie even has a Salmoneus-clone played (hilariously) by Harvey Fierstein. Watch it, enjoy it, but don't expect too much from it. if you don't like the genre or have standards higher that daytime television (Hercules is now a kids TV filler on channel 5 here) but if you like that sort of thing then this does just about enough to be an entertaining little bit of modern sword and sorcery in the mould of, well, everything else Sorbo has been in! ever-delectable Tia Carrere plays a witch who plans to take over the world, and she is absolutely delicious as a supernatural villainess. The fights are clumsily staged, the sets are from hunger, but the dialog is a lot of fun and everyone would appear to be having a good time. A rainy day pick. It certainly kicks Red Sonja's butt.

Air Force One (1997)	"good enough that you care about the characters.As others have noted, the CGI aerial sequences sometimes have the aircraft moving in unnatural or impossible ways, and this is visually jarring. (After the touch-and-go, Air Force One turns a 180 almost like a helicopter) I gave it a 7 out of 10 - not brilliant, but makes for an entertaining evening. wife and daughter who are prisoners on board... Gary Oldman almost steals the show as the head terrorist Ivan Korshunov who takes over the president's plane...Beautifully directed by Wolfgang Petersen who controls the action with his usual extreme intelligence, building the challenge with captivating, tense sequences from every compartment of the huge aircraft to the White House contingent in Washington... up the plane. They thought the president had escaped, but the truth was he stayed behind to fight the terrorists, retake the plane and save his family.This movie is a great action flick which I enjoyed a lot. It's not meant to be ground-breaking or anything like that, it's just meant to be enjoyed. So go out and enjoy it! of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.A few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the ""It's just a movie"" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President. is especially interesting in the context of our current president, George W. Bush. Bush has also gone on record many times for not negotiating with terrorists and takes a hardline approach similar to Harrison Ford. What would Bush do if terrorists hijacked his plane or kidnapped his family? Even giving me that visual image made this film worth the viewing. "	6.5	0
Hunt for Red October, The (1990)	the CIA nerd who was thrust into a field situation without any real experience.  In this way, I felt he was a better representation of the character as Clancy originally wrote him.This is a highly entertaining and engrossing film that will keep most action and suspense viewers on the edge of their seats.  I rated it a 9/10. Lastly, the great use of special effects, from which George Lucas himself could use a clue or two: it smoothly supports, and doesn't take the place of or interfere with, the development of the plot.This is my #2 favorite movie of all-time, but you don't have to take my word for it. See it yourself! You'll be glad you did. actors (including current TN Sen. Fred Thompson) that appear on screen subsequently all have distinct but nonetheless crucial roles to the plot.Baldwin, in what is and will probably be his career best role ever, shines as the intelligent and patriotic Jack Ryan, a thinking man's hero.  Connery lends incredible presence, as usual, to his interpretation of Ramius.A pure masterpiece. and lets the screenplay speak louder than his role as the man in charge of it all and the film's photography is tense along with the editing and sound. An Oscar winner for sound effects editing, 'The Hunt for Red October' will put a submarine in your living room if you have the DVD 5.1. surround sound. It's positively realistic! seen it.  It could have been the beginning of a franchise for Alec Baldwin.  He is very much centered and controlled.  Sean Connery is also standout.Could recommend this to anyone without hesitation. On DVD it's a visual feast.  Just a great looking movie.  Wish that all the other Clancy books had been adapted so well. 	7.6	1
My Own Private Idaho (1991)	"dream, which is what Mike's life basically is.This is a haunting and very sad tale about friendship and finding a home. The performances, especially Phoenix and Udo Kier and Van Sant's dream-like direction are what you remember. ""My Own Private Idaho"" may be a flawed film, but in my opinion, it is one of the very best of the '90's. blend of styles overall. The big themes (the search for love and belonging) are conveyed in a very interesting and genuinely moving manner. I particularly enjoyed the symbolism and pathos the film flittingly suggests. The performances are uniformly excellent, and this movie remains one of my all-time favourites. One of the greatest (and most unique) indie movies of the 1990's. the tragic deaths at the end... that film is just pure magic to me! Just writing about it makes me want to see it again - what, for the 20th time or something?! And the tragedy at My Own Private Idaho's core is so universal, it really becomes completely secondary whether it's about and between men, women, homosexuals or heterosexuals. beautiful title!) mostly deals with loneliness, virile sexuality and friendship, and paternity. It's much more than ""a film about rent boys"". Besides, by watching it my contemporaries will realize that Keanu Reeves isn't Neo from ""The Matrix"", but a versatile actor; and, perhaps, they'd discover that friendship - and romantic love - between two men can be truly sincere. 10/10. steps carefully plotted. The use of lesser known actors is refreshing, and the chemistry between River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves is overwhelming. This is a must see for any lover of independent films, for any person tired of predictable plots, or for anyone who wants to open their heart to vulnerable characters and love them. This movie gets you involved. "	7.1	0
Kiss Me, Guido (1997)	"Bronx and lower Manhattan.  The light comedy involves mistaken identities, misunderstandings, and mis-pairings, with somewhat stereotypical character types and situations. A sincere and energetic cast is headed by handsome Nick Scotti in an impressive comic performance, and all the players seem  to be enjoying themselves with this little romp. I personally found it to be an amusing diversion. yourself"" there is humor in life all around us. Note the lack of violence and the theme that the most improbable pair of people may just be able to find that they have something in common.  It's not Oscar material--accept it for what it is and have a laugh. Oh yes, Nick Scotti ain't bad to look at either. as Barrile's camp best friend. The film is charming, safe, and very watchable - and Scotti's only 'gay' kiss in the entire picture is with the one person you'd least expect. Enjoy...NB. The movie inspired a short-lived TV series, ""Some of My Best Friends"" (2001), with Jason Bateman as the gay guy, and Danny Nucci as his ultra-hunky straight roommate. KISS ME GUIDO enough to give it a peck not a smooch. Maybe Tony Vitale can do as I suggest and boost the whole thing up a few octaves and make it bigger and louder and funnier and genuinely raucous. See NORMAN IS THAT YOU from 1976 for pointers....or THE (new musical version) PRODUCERS from Mel Brooks and go there. you can't be offended. And it IS a silly movie anyways. And it has a happy ending.The acting is all pretty good if a little shrill. Scotti especially comes off well. He's also very handsome and we get a few shots of his muscular chest.So, not good but fun. A true guilty favorite.Best line: ""You threw up on your shirt"". "	6.1	0

Good acting from all. lesson on life. The ever-so sexy & hot Douglas Spain plays this character better than anyone as he parades through the hills trying to get what he wants...this film isn't for everyone, but, if you are willing to sacrifice TALENT over STORY, then please see one of Hollywoods hottest upcoming actors (Spain) in his best role yet. 1-10 (10) Z. lacks purpose, plays out uneven, is occasionally hard to swallow, and when it runs out of time it just quits. Overall the film has its moments but they're too few and too far between. A somewhat gritty drama with strong sexual content, ""Star Maps"" just doesn't measure up. Most likely to be appreciated by indie lovers and Mex-Am audiences. (C-) as a result.Overall this is an interesting enough film but it tries to do too much and succeeds in none of them. The main failure is that it is never convincing enough to engage and, although it never drags, it is certainly difficult to care about all the things that are happening. Distracting then, but certainly not a ""good"" movie. is something of a backhanded compliment to writer/director Miguel Arteta because you genuinely care for the characters in the movie , you feel great sympathy for some of them but because the majority are shown as freaks , pimps and whores it becomes very difficult and despite being very involving it's far from entertaining due to the subject matter .

In & Out (1997)	said, I didn't watch it from the start, but I found it really interesting and relaxing, and a totally different style of film than i'd seen.I felt the movie really got across the pot-smoked atmosphere it was trying to describe.It's not nearly as bad as the other review said, if you're interested in seeing an art porno from the 60s. that the film was meant to raise eyebrows of the time and push the limit of film.All in all for an 'indie' film of it's time I would say that Kent did a pretty good job of this movie and the there were some spectacular shots in the film. So I'm going to give this an 8 out of 10. and it gets all orange and tilty. It has a documentary feel, and if the NFB actually funded this, every person in Canada who has ever watched a movie should commit suicide. The young couple wanders around, see the sites of Montreal, get High, party, wear 60's clothing, and have sex. High is a laughable effort, and certainly Kent's worst. 	6.1	0

It is the best ending to any movie I have ever seen.Perhaps you might have to appreciate the complexities of human nature as well as the action sequences in The Edge to get the most out of the viewing experience.It truly is the best of both worlds. and best-of-all, a great action story that has you focused intently for the full two hours.A human characteristic so often ignored in films the past half century is put on display here: compassionate forgiveness. Seeing forgiveness demonstrated instead of revenge is almost shocking to see. Kudos to the filmmakers, too, for not going overboard on the brutality in this adventure. is a well written, well acted, well directed thriller. Anthony Hopkins as always turns in a great performance but the big suprise is Alec Baldwin who did just as well. This film has some of the best dialogue ever written for a movie of this type, and the action scenes are clever and blazingly paced. This is a terrific movie. marketed for having ""Jaws with Claws,"" there is SO much more depth and detail to this movie.  This is easily in my top 10 films of all time.  It connected with me and I hope you enjoy it too.  10 out of 10!Best Line: CHARLES: ""I have always wanted to do something that was... that was unequivocal"" How do we look at success - when we see it in others, do we feel envy or admiration?

His talents, although recognized, have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday, someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents. Highly Recommended. MJR viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  It's truly a masterpiece. actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner. with the seamy side of Los Angeles in the post-World War II 1950s.  Los Angeles is a place of shady dealings and police corruption.  To add to those problems is the creation of the smutty tabloid.  Multi-layered and smart, ""L.A. Confidential"" will be the greatest survivor of the films released in 1997. 5 out of 5 stars. an absolute must-see! Told through a variation on the theme of ""good cop, bad cop"" with an overarching corruption angle, this film cleverly deals with issues of racism, social justice and ethics in a non-discriminatory manner. Character development is well-done and the dramatic tension is superb. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, you won't be disappointed! "	8.3	1

Highly recommended. their lifestyle. The cinematography was breathtaking and perfectly matched the mood of the film. I loved this movie so much that I'm going to buy it immediately. I love uplifting epic types of movies and this is truly one of the better ones I've seen in a while. In fact, it's one the better movies I've seen in a while. Heinrich's autobiography, it appears that virtually every event in the movie was made up, including the business with the watch. I don't understand why, because the true story was fascinating, with lots of drama.  What is wrong with the minds and egos of people in Hollywood? If they want to completely distort the original facts, don't call it non-fiction. so charming he nearly steals the whole film.  An engrossing blend of fact and fiction, the picture manages to avoid condescending to the Tibetans and over-reverent preachiness.

Wishmaster (1997)	"winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint.Conclusion.A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre. Divoff.  He has the one of the scariest, harshest voices of all time.  He is the Djinn and he's cool as hell.  I just can't understand why this wasn't as well received by the horror community as it should have been.  As for the sequels, what sequels? Stick to the original and you can't go wrong. Yes, the gore is excessive, but I'm not sure if that's a concession to the 90's audience, or a directorial conceit - I'm willing to assume its the former.  For a supernatural thriller/horror (as opposed to a Scream-type slasher/thriller), Wishmaster strikes me as one of the better efforts to come along since the last Nightmare and the first Candyman. he's not an utterly brilliant character. Divoff is absolutely perfect in the role. Even if all he did was real aloud from phone book he'd be mesmerizing.If you like gore, ghoulish make-up effects, and don't mind horror humor that feels like it was conjured up by a bunch of drunken frat boys, then you'll find plenty to like about Wishmaster. demon with her intelligence; and there is homage to horrors movie, with the participation of Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund and Tony ""Candyman"" Todd.

Thousand Acres, A (1997)	"I really enjoyed it.  Michelle Pfeiffer should have received another Oscar nomination for her fearless portrayal of Rose Cook Lewis, the character modeled after Shakespeare's evil Regan from ""King Lear.""  While all of the performances are solid, they seem somehow timid next to Pfeiffer, who once again proves that she is most definitely not just another pretty face. know better than to put a hopelessly senile person on the witness stand.  The fine cast does pretty well, especially Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer, although as usual Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely adequate as the youngest sister.  Maybe watching this on a stormy Sunday night helped put me in the mood, but I rather enjoyed this one. I loved the way her character slowly changed through the movie and Lange can evoke so much emotion in the viewer with something as small as a hand gesture. Pfieffer is strong as well although the story mainly revolves around Ginny and I don't really see why Pfieffer gets first billing here. I strongly recommend the film, espeically on dvd. Smiley(, screenplay (Laura Jones), and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that, in my younger days, I wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. I didn't focus on this fact until years later.If you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. Maybe you are ready for it. but I think all the performances were outstanding, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity.  Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool.  I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again! "	6.0	0
Game, The (1997)	"And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his co-stars. I was engrossed by all and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.There is plenty for everybody here. Fun for all. A big winner in my book and definitely on my list of all time favorites. Get it and enjoy the ride! Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film. those looking for a ""different"" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s. of this masterpiece I kept asking myself, ""where is this movie going?""  For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires.  Michael Douglas is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly.  I love this movie, it's definitely one of my personal favorites. but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.Years from now, when Fincher is honored with his lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards, his true fans will always remember this film.

Can a woman who spends her time at home making parties and pleasing her husband ever feel fulfilled? Did Mrs. Dalloway make the right decision in ""playing it safe"" in life?

This film is a triumph. century, and the film as a truly remarkable and beautiful capturing of it. The only touch I regretted was the opening of the film with the Septimus Warren-Smith war scenes. The opening really belongs with Mrs. D. and her first words, ""I will buy the flowers myself."" After that moment, it's a quiet day but a beautiful and sensitive one. Every actor was completely believable in his/her role. But the most brilliant performance of all was Rupert Graves as Septimus Warren Smith, the tragic young war hero suffering from delayed shell shock.

I Love You, I Love You Not (1996)	Danes and Moreau though are heartfelt, and the message is there for those who want to see it. This movie means well and attempts to educate us on one of the all time greatest blights on mankind - prejudice.Worth a look for early performances from Jude Law, James Van Der Beek and Julia Stiles before they hit the big time. The viewer is left sitting there with the ending, and yet wondering why bother as the movie does deliver fully in engrossing the viewer and placing them into another world.  It is a third person movie and you are that 3rd person -- a casual observer never to really enter.A first draft, by a child, compared to Schindler's List. Then, there was the uproarious casting of Robert Sean Leonard, I couldn't help but laugh when I continually saw him on screen. The only actor worth mentioning in this film was Julia Stiles, but that was because she kept her mouth shut. This was a disaster from the beginning and should be forgotten by all! Grade: * out of ***** don't see it coming, you feel like it should be starting to get good, and the plot holes filled up..well, they aren't, and it does. It's really quite aggrivating.  Jude Law and Claire Danes performances are great, but not quite enough to push this movie onto my favourite list. But, don't let me discourage you, it's worth the rent. feel the significance of the holocaust, that they trivialise it.  Part of coming of age for jewish girls is therefore that they should (or simply do) experience failed love affairs with gentiles.

Red Corner (1997)	their state-centered society is sharp and, from my experience, accurate.  It is delivered as part of an entertaining story with very strong performances by the leads.  I like Richard Gere in this, as I do Ling Bai's performance.  Their chemistry attracts the viewer and helps us through the difficult issues the film addresses.  A must see. I thought the ending was a bit confusing because things happened almost too fast for the viewer to take in. At two hours, the film could have been trimmed a tad but the lulls in here were not much. Overall, an underrated film and unjustly criticized by the national critics, most of whom don't like it when communism is bashed. any other nation, should be equivocal and based on standing for your own values, not another's, and that means not compromising liberties and freedoms standing at the very core of enlightened, progressive society. Like Red Corner's tagline says, leniency for those who confess and comply, severity for those who dare resist, that will be our downfall.Rating: * * * * from beautiful Aberystwyth, Philip Davies, has it about right in his review printed beneath mine.This is beautifully shot, with wonderful acting in a riveting Hitchcock type movie. Richard Gere is excellent - the politics and scenes of a changing China are fascinating.I strongly recommend this one. This is very exciting, suspenseful, romantic - and its depiction of China rings true. the tarmac does much to salvage that. Maybe Gere wanted to make the Chinese look bad, but they certainly don't need his help. Based on an incident that happened not in China but in Italy, Red Corner is viewable without ever coming close to being a great film. Its one claim to greatness is Ling Bai - she's absolutely fabulous. 	6.3	0
Jackal, The (1997)	the film; the budget was well spent and the result is total credibility. A strong cast helps; Willis is brilliant as the cold, chameleon-like central character. Poitier and of course Gere are equally superb. Jack Black is at home with the role of technological wizard; who of course has an Achilles heel; as his hippy, cool persona reveals. Highly recommended. lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films (even seen Mercury Rising?) that get off scot-free somehow, but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained. action and entertainment extravaganza. Bruce Willis was a perfect choice for the Jackal and Sidney Poitier was as always amazing and really helped the atmosphere of the movie with his role. The ending was a bit short, but in my opinion necessary, because I knew what was going to happen, so why delay it. Nicely done, and great music. 7/10 though a little breathless, is fine. Regardless, the story-line never reached much beyond the ordinary thriller fare. Making a truly great thriller requires either doing something really original (very hard to do) or using a truly inspired script. This film's script is decent, but the story line could have used a little more careful thought and a bit more complexity. IRA terrorist that pursues Jackal a likable guy as well is probably another one, but I wont go into that). All in all, it was a suspenseful voyage with such a good pace that you don't care about the shortcomings at the first viewing, so I say it's recommendable.

Anastasia (1997)	"and find a true place (in this case, happily together with him).""Anastasia"" is really my favourite movie of all time, even though now I'm almost 15. I'd recommend it to anyone, and advise historical literialists to look beyond the fiction and let yourself be taken on a ""Journey to the Past"" with the romance, comedy, and magic of this story. re-create lavish Russian and Parisian locations (complete with recognizable artworks and cameos by celebrities of the '20s), and the screenplay balances action, humor, and genuine emotion. Villain Rasputin is clearly aimed at children, and some of the repartee between Anya and unlikely hero Dimitri may seem jarringly anachronistic, but viewers of any age should still enjoy this timeless coming-of-age story. advance the plot - Unlike so many animated songs put in for the sake of having a song. So it wasn't historically perfect - if it were, there'd be no story. Go ahead and feel smug that you know what really happened, but don't turn to comment to your neighbor, lest you miss one minute of the wonderfully unfolding plot. journey and a couple involving some history on Russia. I really enjoyed the songs that played over the end credits, ""At the Beginning"" and ""Journey To The Past"" sung in her own way by Aaliyah, the beautiful angelic voiced R&B singer who left way too soon.Brilliantly animated for its time and enjoyable for adults, Anastasia remains a classic family film. hold the key to your heart."" For me, Angela Lansbury provides a completely human and poignant character in the Dowager Empress. Her prologue was so well paced, and there was a side to the great character actress that I never knew she had.

Man Who Knew Too Little, The (1997)	"Chase in the Fletch movies (shame they didn't make more of those), as they were both in their comical element.The coincidental (or perhaps not) pairing of these two films really added to my enjoyment of both.  On a cold rainy weekend, I strongly recommend renting both and watching them in the same order I did... you won't be disappointed! best parts of his roles in ""Scrooged"", ""Stripes"", ""Ground Hog Day"" and ""What About Bob""...you just have to be ready to experience Bill Murray at his best.

I have rarely been so disappointed when I had to finally concede that it was the end of the story. Give this a second look if you dismissed it as just a silly movie. It's a classic, and one of my 10 best movies of all time. He is a delight to watch.The rest of the cast is good. Peter Gallagher is Wally's brother. Joanne Whalley makes a perfect femme fatale. Alfredo Molina has some excellent moments as Boris, the butcher, the man who wants to eliminate Wally out of the picture.""The Man Who Knew Too Little"" is a fun film to watch thanks to Jon Amiel. next (just how many movies these days are hard to predict anyways?).The movie is a screwy, difficult to describe spy adventure where everyone knows just how deadly the stakes are---except for Bill Murray's character. He mistakenly thinks everything that is happening around him is a type of performance art (sort of a Theatre of the Absurd). You MUST watch it. "	6.6	0
Alien: Resurrection (1997)	space.The scene is at once meant to be hilarious, gruesome, and, as you shift to Ripley's point-of-view, emotionally devastating. The scene is so appalling because it IS those three things at once, and they are simply not emotions that as humans we can easily juggle.Jeunet was brilliantly inspired in moving the aliens underwater, this scene was a long time coming. although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the horrific Newborn which was truly demonic. Anyway, despite it's flaws, it's still a great film, although it will never be a classic like Alien and Aliens are. Now if only there could be a fifth one with a better script, more character development and more firepower. first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent. I believe Jean-Pierre Jeunet was an excellent choice for a director but the script served him very badly. This is an interesting film to watch for an interesting scene here and there but not in the same league as the previous films. installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien: Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves. an accurate epilogue to the series.  And think about this:  You're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film.  Alien Resurrection was a good movie, and I think that it was as innovative as a third Alien sequel could be. 	6.2	0

Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.Highly recommended. cast as Juba in Gladiator) as Cinque being the true gem.Ultimately, Amistad's greatest strength is that it avoids offering any easy answers and in that sense, does to subconscious issues about race and slavery what Kubrick's 2001 did to space travel and progress, albeit with more humanity and more accessible drama. It's a shame this film is never talked about. to become a classic. My respect for Spielberg's artistry has been taken to another level. Other viewers have commented on static qualities of this film. Well, folks, This was not ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Judgement at Nuremberg""; it was historic filmmaking in more than one way. It was accurate, literate, and not politically correct or incorrect. Bravo, Dreamworks! attorneys have to learn the language and Spielberg graphically portrays their struggle for communication. Hounsou's portrayal of a man in an alien world who's only desire is to go back where he came from will sear your very soul.Amistad is grand entertainment and a needed history lesson about man's need for and willingness to fight to be his own master.

And while the well-known actors in the film (Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson) all turn in fine performances, it is the unknowns --the church members and townfolk -- that really give the film an added authenticity. Apostle that contain faint echoes of his 1983 project Tender Mercies. It hardly matters, since both are interesting films for different reasons.  Some day we'll see Robert Duvall as the vast repository of Americana he really is, until then, The Apostle is one of the best testimonies to his strengths that I know of. Can I get a witness?  His attention to detail in his roles is well known.  He brings quirks and nuances to help flesh out his characters, and this role is no different.The Apostle is a flawed man who can lift others up, but has trouble lifting himself up.  And that contradiction is what gives this movie its flavor. All-in-all, a fine movie. was comprised of local folks ... or at least folks reared in the south ... rather than professional actors.  They all did an excellent job contributing to the realism of this movie.  I almost always enjoy a movie that ""tells it like it is"" ... and sofar, this is one of the most enjoyable I have ever seen. preachers to the warm small-town folk, are real people, not trained in acting. Duvall's story is engaging and beautiful in the way it shows the flaws amid great talent in a man who chooses for himself the calling of Apostle. I love this film, the accurate portrayal of some aspects of southern U.S. life and culture, and especially Duvall's performance. "	7.2	0
Artemisia (1997)	that art was an exclusively male calling, Artemisia Gentileschi can be seen as a proto-feminist, but this does not mean that it is right to see her as a woman of the 1990s transported back in time. Moreover, what sort of feminism is it which portrays as a tender lover a man who in reality was a brutal rapist? 6/10 merit in what amounts to no more than another polished yet undistinguished costume drama with the odd dash of titillatory nudity. For all that, Artemisia herself (Valentina Cervi) is certainly a little cutie and the film is never a chore to watch, but at the end of the day it merely whetted my appetite for more knowledge on the subject. and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers, she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman, in 17th century Italy.Enjoy this film for its own sake, for it is a pretty good romantic drama, but take its historical references with a grain of salt. implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent,' by its complete disregard for her work, by the way it turned her into a sex object, on and on, you get the idea. Also, I find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her. power.  It makes me sad that this great artist had to struggle so hard in her life, struggle to be believed and taken seriously.  It makes me even more sad that a film about her life would tell the story her attacker would like us to believe.  It is as if the woman has been raped twice. 	6.8	0
Bent (1997)	"would love to have seen that portrayal immortalised on screen), while Mick Jagger is surprisingly good as Greta (a role which could easily be played wrong but he's spot on).This play/film is intended to make its audience confront their prejudices, to shock, move, and inspire them.  I think it is an unmissable experience - a difficult one, but worthwhile. an hour and a half.  The subject matter (homosexual persecution during the Holocaust) was approached with the right amount of dignity and respect.  Bent, furthermore, has the most powerful and original love scene that I have ever seen.  I do feel that it needed more character development, but regardless it is an intensely psychological and powerful movie. see this film just to remind them (us) of just HOW BAD it can get and how ""humans"" can become such sick animals as the Nazis were in this film.  I kept thinking: ""Hey, how can they keep blaming Hitler, when he was not there ordering the guards to torture and ENJOY hurting people like that?""  Powerful film! that are pretty disturbing. And there is an early scene involving Mick Jagger that is pretty interesting. Overall, even though it's interesting, moving and well acted, it's a poor film. There are some undeniably powerful scenes, but there isn't enough there for me. I recommend it if it sounds interesting to you. Just be prepared for some really sloppy directing. music accompaniment.I will see it again. "	7.3	0

The film has a lower budget look but features some good acting although I do give the film a low-to-moderate ""yeah, right"" factor in a few scenes. what I was seeing was possible, however improbable.  She carries the film, but there are several other fine performances here. An added bonus: Lucy Liu, currently appearing in TV's Ally McBeal, in a small but important role as a strung out hooker. Note: I rented this film from BlockBuster under the title ""Bang"" with a release date of 1997. hand held camera going back and forth to the different characters.. but the story, a struggling actress, kicked out of her apartment and thrown into a 'real' acting part by bad circumstances, is very interesting and thought provoking and scary.  The lead actress is particularly good. like i said before.. don't give up.. see it all the way through. have a definite ring of authenticity (you will never say to yourself ""no, this couldn't happen""). The director's documentary-like technique draws you into the film; on the other hand, it doesn't give you too many insights into the characters. Ultimately, the film comes to a dead end - like its heroine, it has nowhere to go.    (**1/2) came out.. No one heard. I imagine because of its extremely indie nature. It's worth seeking out for the important message it brands upon the viewer, it's frank and very candid approach, and it's rabbit hole glance at one woman in trouble, navigating a zone out of depth in an unchosen guise.

Butcher Boy, The (1997)	study.Sinead O'Connor is a scream as the Virgin Mary.The thick accents in this film make it a little bit difficult to follow in parts, but American audiences should still be able to understand most of the dialogue.I cannot recommend this film highly enough; it is proof that you can still make a quality movie without buying into cheap Hollywood cliches. themes in this movie (murder, suicidal thoughts, alcoholism, child abuse, religion) however it's not a disturbing movie (it has its moments though). The reason for the lack of disturbance in this film is because we're seeing everything from the perspective of a little boy.The Butcher Boy is, for sure, one of the best dark comedies/dramas that I've seen. Highly recommendable. frightening.  And it's a comedy! Neil Jordan is a craftsman and creates a very enjoyable movie even given the very dark subject matter.  The child actor's are great, the best I've seen this side of PONETTE.  If the subject and its treatment don't put you off you will like this movie.  If not, try something else. films...but I believe this one is his finest job...it's like watching Sleepers, Psycho and A Clockwork Orange at the same time.

I give it 85% and maybe it deserves better. what I expected, and if you're looking for a horror movie about madness, look elsewhere.

But other than the characterization, Woody's new flick is witty, cold-hearted, extremely vulgar, often tasteless and perfectly profane with enough catch-lines to keep film buffs cracking for years (`I always keep a little hooker money around').  Hannah And Her Sisters this ain't! humour is at times crude and pokes fun at his usual groups (ie - ultraorthodox jews, hookers, WASP's and just about everyone else).Allen uses his interesting techniques and smart plot to make this such a good film. One can only wonder how he always gets the foxes. At least he got Billy Crystal to play the devil. How fitting.8/10 stars. his life as he travels to a university for an honor. Memories mix with scenes this writer's fiction, providing opportunities for the large and excellent ensemble cast. Many of Allen's later films seem tired, but the neurotic jumpiness he brings to ""Deconstructing Harry"" reinjects energy into his work. If you loved ""Husbands and Wives,"" try this. I rate it 9. if you are not a Woody Allen fan you will like this movie. If you are a fan of big blockbuster movies (standard Hollywood confention movies) this movie is a must see as well!

Flubber (1997)	kids will lap it up, but adults probably won't like it as much. The second half of the movie is more meandering in quality compared to the first half, very little of interest happens and some of the situations come across as ridiculous. All in all, somewhat forgettable, but for a kids movie it is pretty entertaining. 6/10 Bethany Cox love with her boss type - she also creates a strangely moving scene.  The flubber is good - best in one big musical number halfway through and I wonder if they could have had more imaginative scenes with it as a character rather than just a bouncy ball.Overall it's a kids film - don't expect anything more than that. or two sneaky-vulgar lines but nothing much.With the flubber-substance making balls bounce forever, into every object, you get a lot of slapstick scenes that are either stupid or laugh-out-loud funny. The story, geared a lot more for kids than adults, has a nice lighthearted feel to it. For adults, one viewing is plenty, but kids will enjoy it multiple times. flubber is out and about. In summary, the film's problem is probably a case of trying too hard in the special effects category and not enough in the remaining aspects of film making. Even so, it is not a stretch to say that most families will like Flubber, as everyone will be amazed by the stunning look of the movie. in this film, Weebo would fail the test. She (Weebo has a female voice and personality) is smart, funny, sensitive and lovable, much more so than anyone else in the film, so it would be easy to tell them apart.

I've seen ""For Richer or Poorer"" several times and highly recommend it. simple Google search for Amish brought up several good sites. perhaps this is the real success of this movie - that viewers hear the message of simplicity and virtue in living one's life, then take the next step to learn more about the Amish culture and beliefs, and finally take to heart these life lessons we learned as a child. don't think you'll hate it.

As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER. Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching. this movie is the writing.  Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list.

These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure!6/10 but from then on it's an adequate (if not exceptional) score from Hans Zimmer pal Nick Glennie-Smith. Despite these key differences of characters and theme, it still feels like it has enough continuity with the others.It's a totally worthwhile and enjoyable sequel that has a bad rep for no reason. Home Alone 4 on the other hand...now THAT is BAD! with a new family that would keep the spirit of home alone alive...remember it's for the kids. plus the bad guys were more advanced then marv & harry (not saying that i didn't like marv & harry) but these guys had high-tec equitment that was pretty cool.

The performances from Carol Kane (totally crazy) and Molly Ringwald (in a very against-the-type turn) are very good. The supporting cast (German actress Barbara Sukowa and The Soprano's Michael Imperioli) is also interesting. I think this film makes a perfect midnight video snack with some friends. fans who enjoyed the better-received ""May"" (which I personally didn't care for) might like this movie's look and mood. As for me, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this is the product of a bunch of chuckling New York hipsters who thought they were doing something ""postmodern"" and ""ironic"" but only churned out something uninspired and limp... albeit artsy. doubt, a good deal of her earnings.The supporting cast is up to task under Ms. Sherman's direction.

The Quebecois actor, whose fluent English has nevertheless always sported his Quebec origins, has difficulties with a Southern accent. But his ample acting abilities and over the top characterization of what is best described as a male Blanche Dubois, still bring the most appealing aspects of this film to life. out at the mansion, thoroughly cripple the piece. (What marvelous visuals this sequence might have made for--but alas, we'll never know.)

It's still gritty and bloody, and it's also loaded with lots of nice material matter. I do not understand why it is not as appreciated as it is, regarding the rating mostly. Scream fans and horror lovers were all pleased with this movie when it came out, so I have heard, and I was as well. one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well.

Just don't expect Hitchcock. characters' motives and behaviors is artfully executed and the musicality of the picture's dynamics is professionally effected. - It's more engaging than most popcorn entertainments and a welcome addition to a genre that in these times seems to be in an advance state of decline.

Titanic (1997)	all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed. young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word! doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job. on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done. when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.

Rating : 6'5 , well worth watching . wrong with a torpedo?) Nevertheless, the Bond films are not meant to be works of social realism and unlike, say, the novels of John Le Carre, have never purported to give an accurate picture of life in the British Secret Service. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a good example of what the Bond films have always been- superior escapist entertainment. 7/10 by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated. loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors... Vincent Schiavelli plays the menacing Dr. Kaufman, a professional hit-man, and a priest of pain... The 18th Bond movie has it all: Too much action (including an exciting chase through the streets of Saigon on a stylish BMW R1200); an effective girl; and a super car... who has also been sent to find out what Carver's up to. Lin and Bond team up in the last part of the film, and their chemistry is impeccable. Lin also gets to kick some butt, which is always fun to see.Overall, if you're looking for some good IL' action and adventure, you can't go wrong with James Bond. 10/10 	6.5	0

OK, it was a low budget film, but then I've seen low budget films where the images were clear and there was decent lighting.The only thing the movie has going for it are several pretty good performances.  How rich this movie could have been with a better screenplay and a better director.A reel loser! ""low-life"" gay stuff just contributes to the overall exotic and gritty atmosphere.The short ""Loopy"" was a cute experimental short of the sort that would fit in well with other shorts at a film festival.All in all, this film will only be appreciated by certain types of viewers -- perhaps those who like to check out film festivals for new talent.

THis a story to curl up with on the sofa on a cold, wet afternoon. It pulls at your heart strings and also has you smiling at tender moments. There is even one great belly laughing scene. I first saw this on U.K. TV and immediately ordered it on video. It's certainly in my top ten films of all time. It is a very simple story, that had me fixed to the screen. The acting is fluid and easy to watch, especially Joseph Ashton, who for someone so young, was just so real in the part of Little Tree. The photography was great, and had an almost dream like quality. A film that I am so glad to have seen. the book, because although the movie is fairly true the book has alot more that cannot be covered in a 2 hr movie.The actors are very good, Graeme Green is wonderful as always.This movie should be nominated for an Oscar, but of course it won't because stories about Native Americans are not nominated, or seen by the movie going public. raise the boy and he is wise beyond his years thanks to them!

Don't rely on some magazine writer to tell you who's good and who's not. Your brain is there for a reason. is a complex and entertaining film and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in examinations of American culture and tradition, perhaps as a double feature with Citizen Cane (I am not, however, claiming that the Postman was as good a film as Citizen Cane, only that they have a similar theme... what does it mean to be an American?). carries through the entire movie, which is almost three hours long, a positive and uplifting theme that you rarely get to see in these type of films. The ending of the film, call it corny it you will, was really moving without being obnoxious like it could have been had it been made by a lesser talent then Kevin Costner. technicly this film is top draw. Sets, locations, effects and design grab you by the hand and take you someplace you actually want to go. i would much rather make and see films like this than dross like 'chaicago' and 'moulin rouge'. this is a film for grownups with a bit of imagination and respect for the film makers art. movie prior to seeing it.

Highly recommended.

By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'! takes and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the characters with all their differences. A more mature Tarantino. Still loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: ""This one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera. It's a character study."" Jackie Brown is not a graphic crime story like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction that preceded it. Nor is it a stylized revenge saga like Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 that followed it. Instead it is a stand alone film. A wonderfully acted character study. And for me, an absolute gem of a film. It's Quentin Tarantino's underrated MASTERPIECE. that Pulp was and is.  However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.  The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One. a crush. The last scene in the movie between these two characters is absolutely brilliant.I highly recommend this film and it's fun to watch Tarantino mature as a director. The little extras littered throughout the film such as ""Chick with Guns"", the fabulous locations such as the Cockatoo Inn, and the excellent characters make this film well worth a view. "	7.5	1
Kundun (1997)	"fan of Scorsese and are not sure you are going to like this just give it a chance, it deserves at least one viewing, if you give it that I am sure you will be amazed as I was.  Scorsese's vision's in this movie are unlike any of his films, not to mention a great score by Phillip Glass. Ironically they were also victims of imperialism but learned the exact way to extort, destroy the property and beliefs of others by the power of machines. It was just sad to watch. But as Kundun implied, those violence's are in the shadow of our minds which should be overcame by the power of spirit. For me, this movie tells that. isn't (or at least doesn't seem) forced, but are instead allowed to unfold in a more naturalistic and lifelike fashion also seems to mirror Buddhist ideas admirably.This is a far more complex film than it first might appear to be - far from being a simple biopic, KUNDUN is much much more. Definitely one of Martin Scorsese's least appreciated films. a real treat, with the images being more powerful than anything Scorsese has done before.  And while the music here is old territory for Philip Glass, he produces a stunning score which should have won the Oscar.  The mostly non-professional cast(I did see a familiar face here and there, but I can't remember them) also does good work. this ""slice of the metaphysical river"", is breathtaking in its visual beauty. A story that grabs your heart and soul, and you find yourself, thinking about it weeks later.Now I have a ""Free Tibet"" sticker on my Pathfinder, out of reverence for this tiny country, raped by the political powers in control of China.Bravo to the cast, and film crews.

The fight scenes were static and bland. If you want a good ninja film for the kids, rent Surf Ninjas. Also, even thinking about Colt's haircut still makes me cringe a week after I saw the film... saw this movie and broke down in tears, as I knew my eyes had witnessed the most beautiful sight since Stallone and Carl Weathers flirting with each other on the beach in one of the Rocky films.

A brave effort that goes against the formulaic grain of the majority of Hollywood releases.  Cyndia Willams (Vanessa) was very pleasing to the eye as the mysterious, seductive woman that plays Daryl as the fool. She is the other reason to watch this movie.  Also, some other notable guest cameo is made the Candy Man, Snoop Doggy Dog, and Ll Cool J of ""Deep Blue Sea"" (who didn't go down like a punk). Williams was dreadful. I would have to say that she delivers one of the worst performances I have ever seen. Joseph Lindsey was the only enjoyable part. His performance was hilarious, and yet he has gone on to do nothing else. So in short if you are thinking of seeing this movie, it would be less painful to castrate yourself.  Every stereotype and cliché is used, as well as howlingly bad dialogue (""Nobody was waiting for me but a dude named destiny"") and the perfunctory hip-hop cameos.

In a way, it is prophetic of us and of the pursuit of discourse: eventually, the discourse challenges those who pursue it. What happens after that, is up to each person. They can fold, stand tall, or accept and promote the challenge to others. But anything they do is for that great pursuit of political discourse. In the end it offers hope that there is the possibility of critiquing the failures of the left while at the same time respecting the real intellectual vigilance of those whose humility allowed that fascism could have many possible origins, and that we should never be so smug as to think our own actions could not give rise to it. The music, though, gave me a feeling of change that was possible in an America that had been cheated by following a tight-lipped closed-minded patriotism.

Senseless (1998)	came off very boring and quite annoying in most scenes. But overall, this movie was pretty good. I really liked it, and if your a Wayans or Lillard fan, I'm sure you will too. This movie is pretty much all about immature jokes, so if you are not looking for that kind of comedy, you should try a different movie. it a crap rating should watch it again, as I pity them for their lack of humour and understanding of a good comedy. I gave this film a ten and I think it was worth every point. Anybody else agree-let me know.Vote and lets get this movie up from the paltry score of 5.4(what an insult)ENOUGH SAID. WAYANS BROTHERS ROCK. an actor since Mo Money and that other movie I think it was called 'Dont go dissin your homeboy while drinkin yo juice in the hood', however Mathew Lillard cant seem to break away from that surfer dude retro generation exxer persona that we see in most of his films.David Spade tries hard but Wayans upstages everyone.9 out of 10 he usually is. He excels at playing jerk loser characters, but Scott had more dimension than the usual Spade type.Richard McDonagle was quite good as one of the top men at Smythe-Bates. And Tamara Taylor impressed as Janice. Esther Scott had a brief but effective performance as Darryl's determined mother.This was really worth seeing. Don't be misled by the title. least get something out of this movie. Keeping in mind I am not a huge Wayans or Spade fan, both gave good performances. Wayans had some great moments.Directed by Penelope Spheeris, (Wayne's World) - Senseless is overall a pretty good movie with a warm ending, which, being as it *is* a comedy, is a *lot* better than a cold ending!6.5/10 	6.0	0
Wag the Dog (1997)	"CIA head William H. Macy.Really I don't know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart, funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around. This is an American political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes on.OVERALL: 9/10. Buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality. pessimistic, and Stanley's is to be optimistic.  And Hoffman never condescends to Stanley, instead showing a talented, maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his life(""F*** my life, I want the credit!"" is one of the best lines of the film"").  Contrary to his line, this film is not nothing. are guaranteed to excel in a film like this, but good work is also done by people like Heche, Denis Leary, William H. Macy, Woody Harrelson and even Willie Nelson (!?). Somewhat ignored in 1997, but still one of the best films of that year and one of the more important films of the 1990s. 4.5 out of 5 stars. hugely serious points but it does make you think about how the media is used to shape public perception and make us think what those in charge want us to think.Overall a very funny, very clever satire that has a great cast, the only criticism being that it stretches it's point a little too far with the ""old shoe"" section. system which is made by and for TV. Several lines from that movie (""Why Albania?"" - ""Why not?"", ""Albania does not rhyme"", ""What do you remember about the Gulf war? One smart bomb... I was in that building when we shot that shot"", and many more) are impossible to forget because everyday political life does not let us forget them. "	7.1	0
Dark City (1998)	"sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality. the eye, and venturous special effects.  DARK CITY is recommended viewing with the lights out!  A  thoroughly  cogent flick which keeps you guessing what is going on.  DARK CITY is a fine treat for the eyes and mind.  This is one journey where you reach the point of no return!RATING: *** out of ****. he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand. The story is so fantastic and Proyas' nightmare world come true in that movie.I can basically say that it's one of the best science fiction movies ever made, it opens doors to different dimensions and force human brains' capability....""Mutlu Bahar"" is the acting is excellent. Rufus Sewell plays his role with conviction and passion. The casting is flawless. The Last Word: Awesome flick. This is a movie that is excellent brain food. It makes you think....a lot. You will most likely watch this over and over again to figure everything out. No problem. This movie never gets old. Highly recommended. truly think.The show down was a little weak, but the film made this up again at the very end with the last meeting between Murdoch and Mr. Hand. I remember Murdoch's words well and he speaks of a truth which is sometimes forgotten: What makes us human is not to be found in our heads, our brains and our minds. "	7.7	1
Star Kid (1997)	"is what it is."" The actors are all decent, the effects are better than I had expected, and best of all, it has heart. I'm building a library of movies for our kids (when we finally have some), and said movies will need to be wholesome family entertainment that I won't mind watching, too. I will definitely include ""Star Kid."" by children - and the inevitable showdown is a little unlikely.  Mind you, most of the fights are really good and the Broodwarrior, although clearly a man in a rubber suit, looks great and is well designed.Overall it's very entertaining.  It's not clever but the humour, spectacle and sense of fun save it from being for kids only. along the same lines of NEVER ENDING STORY where boy gets bullied at school, has a dysfunctional family and finds the meaning of his existence through some kind of adventure. This time through an Alien robot that happens to land on Earth. Our boy enters the Robot and takes control as they create chaos and save the world from doomsday. they play a minor role and eventually make their way to the top.  This story has a bit of a twist to the usual tale, the 'bully' teams up with the 'loser' and they together save mankind.  The humor is kiddie and not very often funny.  But, the plot is well constructed and fine by my standards. new friend(eg.E.T or alien). They go round'n'round the journey and at the ending, the new friend has to go home. So, the kid cries, says goodbye, hugs the friend...I've seen this kind of movies SO many times. ""Star Kid"" is no exception, but the computer graphics and the special effects were great. I give this movie: 6 out of 10. "	5.4	0
Hard Rain (1998)	is different and thought provoking. Doesn't this gain some extra interest given the Hurricane flooding in the southern states also? I enjoy Morgan Freeman's portrayal as well as Christian Slater and Minnie Driver's performances. The old couple is a marvellous piece of human comedy, well portrayed by both actors. Watch this film and then . . . watch it again! in Hard Rain but the script lacks the spark to truly make this great or memorable. Sure there are some exciting moments, but what action film doesn't have some excitement? With such a unique setting, I'm surprised that there just wasn't more of a good thing. Overall, I enjoyed it. This film is good action flick. Nothing more, nothing less. Freeman, Christian Slater, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver, Edward Asner, Michael Goorjian, Dann Florek, Ricky Harris, Mark Rolston, Peter Murnik, Wayne Duvall, Richard Dysart, Betty White, Ray Baker Director: Mikael Salomon Producers: Ian Bryce, Mark Gordon, Gary Levinsohn, Art Levinson, Allison Lyon Segan, Christian Slater Screenplay: Graham Yost Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 37 Mins. Budget: $70.000.000 Box Office: $19,870,567 admit there are times when you know what's going to happen before it does but you do still get some great surprises in there. I love the humor, there is a lot of it but they don't go over the top with it to where you can't take the movie serious. Big thumbs up for this underrated film. Love it!! White as an elderly couple who didn't evacuate when they were supposed to. Randy Quaid overplays heinously as a trigger happy sheriff, and the continual shootouts in the final third get repetitive, but this scenario (an entire town slowly being submerged) is exceptionally well-captured and the filmmakers didn't forget to add some good humor into the mix. **1/2 from **** 	5.8	0
Half Baked (1998)	lighten up and smoke a joint. I'm glad to see stoner comedies back in fashion after suffering through pretentious, preachy, boring 80s anti-drug dramas that are never truly grounded in reality and where the characters always either predictably OD or just simplistically kick their addiction. So rent this movie (or watch it currently on cable), fire up one and enjoy good as Scarface. Rachel True provides good eye candy and decent performance as the female lead. This is not an Oscar film, but hilarious to watch with buddies and after watching it 3 times it doesn't get old. Its a funny screenplay, decent comedic direction and good performances, worth a look for any fan of comedy, pot or cinema.. 9/10 if I didn't get all of the 'inside' stuff that others may refer too. Chappell is great playing several outlandish characters in the movie. The situations they get themselves into are great and even better how they get out of them.There is ample potty humor as well as pot humor to boot. Well worth the rental fee and your time. my opinion. The main characters owned this one. As an aside from a 40 something, it is nice to see that this country(USA)has come along the road far enough whereby having a couple white guys, a black dude and a Cuban sharing a habitat together doesn't come across as contrived. The stoner parts all looked familiar to me. Funny movie. Harland Williams.  Even the cameos are humorous- including Jon Stewart, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Willie Nelson, and Tommy Chong (Chong is perfect as a small role in the movie).  The plot seems kind of basic, but its spiced up for laughs and for people who know what being a dope head is like.  Hilarious all around.  A+ 	6.7	0
Fallen (1998)	"thriller. This film will play with your mind, it won't cover the screen with visuals and gore; that's why it works.Sit back and be absorbed by the story, be amazed by the cast, and be shocked by the climax.Warning, if you bore easily stay away, if you love a mind bending thriller; you won't find many better.Fantastic and clever 9/10 Yes we like to see the human spirit triumph, but more often than not things do not work out the way we like them to. It's refreshing to see a movie which ends on a real level, giving the film a true-to-life credibility which enhances the terror even more. Highly recommended for the intellectual person. Those easily bored stay away. past 2 hours. All the answers to your questions are in there and that is why I think this movie is way above average. Why I have not heard of this movie before is beyond me. I think maybe the title came across as a bit generic, which the film is anything but. It comes highly recommended by me. 9.5/10 perfect movie worth buying for your collection. It's not only a great murder-mystery detective movie, but it probes deeper into the realms of faith, religion, philosophy and imagination and thus stands out as a movie more memorable than most. If you like ""Seven"" and ""The Ninth Gate"", you're certainly gonna like this one. I've seen it at least 6 times. how to remain believable and realistic. The viewer never knows what he is going to get and what will happen next. This is why it is best not to know too much about this movie's story before viewing it for the first time.

Shooting Fish (1997)	"It isn't a thought provoking piece of angst, but then it never ever professes to be.I now own this on dvd, and after several watches it still remains fresh and engaging and never fails to put a smile on my face.There's no individual outstanding component in this film, but it's one that I just *keep* coming back to. Superb fun. to a tee.This film would be great viewing for a date (perhaps not for a lads night in), and has the simple comedy you might expect from such classic British TV series as ""Only Fools and Horses"", or ""Last of the Summer Wine"".It doesn't require much brain power, but is one of the best homegrown (British) comedies of recent(ish) years. into the story to make it even more entertaining. A stand out is the interesting relationship that Dylan and Jez have with each other, Dylan being the fast talking American and Jez being the British techno genius. I recommend 'Shooting Fish' to all movie-goers. It has a great soundtrack, is funny, romantic, creative and a great achievement for British filmmaking. about implementing them. This film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular - simply put, they work. On every level. Watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching While you were Sleeping, for example. For the sheer sweetness of the film and for Kate Beckinsale's performance, I'd give it 7 on 10. twists and turns to keep you on your toes, `Shooting Fish' is a solid, feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment.  And in the final analysis, that's not such a bad deal; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10. "	6.6	0
Prophecy II, The (1998)	Walken comes back to play Gabriel, but that and a few humorous sections were all that was good about this film. The ending was the best part. Too bad you have to watch the whole thing to get to it. If you've seen and liked the first, then I recommend watching this one, but don't have too high of expectations. it's a sequel. I've read a lot of bad reviews of this film, which I don't understand. It seems so much like the original to me, and the original instantly became one of my favorite movies.As a bonus (to me anyway) one of my favorite actors, Tom Towles, has a small role.The scene just before the ending is absolutely breathtaking. of 10 at best. has a great a sense of humor. Gosh, ya gotta love the guy! Well, no surprise Hollywood would do that.Having said that, though, and for strictly entertainment value and nothing else, the movie isn't half bad! Walken, regardless of his role, is always fun to watch, the story moves fast and it's only 80 minutes long. You could do worse. effects and action.I fully expected The Prophecy 2 to suck when I first watched it, and even recently when I dragged it out again I thought rewatching it would uncover hidden flaws and disappoint. It doesn't.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. A case of second verse, much the same as the first, but a worthy sequel to a great film. 	5.8	0
Spice World (1997)	old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyze. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old. movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can. greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst. a long shot, but still quite enjoyable.Oh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls. I was 28 then, and even though I'm 36 now, I still enjoy this movie for what it is. Perhaps that's because I'm OLD ENOUGH to know what it ISN'T. he was lying or being honest we know he is an actor who gets paid big bucks, but the fact Roger Moore was in this film and Meatloaf, I don't think you can call them all sellouts. Fact is Spice Girls did make an impact on us all, this is just a bit of history left to show their mark. 	3.4	0
Deep Rising (1998)	"film with the characters on what island did they come and what happened with those three heroes did they are still alive?10/10 It is been a 20th Anniversary it is fun to re-watch this movie it is my favorite monster sea creature horror film and I enjoy it. I always have fun with this film and it is highly underrated. would have climbed to the top of my favourite movie list. But as with most films the director took the easy way out and chose to ignore this very overlooked area of filmmaking. In my aquatic monster/cruise liner catastrophe marking system, Deep Rising gets a colossal 4 shrimps. But the rather lacking Godfather, gets only 3 angelfish and a haddock. the characters are likable, the creature is neat, and somehow it all comes comes together to make an enjoyable B schlock horror/comedy that, in my case anyway, leaves me with a big smile on my face.Oh and as an added bonus, Famke Janssen is simply lovely in this film. Rent it on a rainy day and you won't be disappointed. like all this movie's flaws, it doesn't matter.If you're easily scared, this'll do the job. If you like tongue-in-cheek, B-grade action flicks, this is one to see. If you like movies that force you to think, make you change your outlook on life, and move you to tears...yeah, you should REALLY watch this. TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON! too predictable, too tame, and not funny enough. But before he Hollywoodized himself in Mummyland, this director (and writer!) gave us the masterful ""Deep Rising.""  B-movie fans know who they are and what they want, and they will not be disappointed here.  I rank ""Deep Rising"" up there with the best of John Carpenter and Sam Raimi. 9/10 "	6.0	0
Tainted (1998)	"the outtakes from Slackers.  Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the humorous riffs from Slackers.  However, this writer simply misfires every joke.  Imagine a room full of 14-year old boys doing improvisational humor.  Maybe the director was channeling the ghost of Ed Wood here, certainly the dialog could have been ghost written by Ed himself. entire film consists of rapid-fire trite and bitchy dialog framing a fairly simple vampire story. While there are a few funny lines throughout the film, they didn't make up for the poor acting, horrid writing and plot holes the size of steamships. The 'vampire plot' had some interesting potential but didn't really explore any of the areas it touched on. to kill myself halfway through it, no scratch that... I wanted to die before the opening scene was even done.  My question is this, who would release this thing? Oh yeah, Troma. That makes sense. Well, I hate myself for paying the dollar to rent this. I give it a 1 only because I can't give it a zero. it into a truly intelligent and well-written film about, well, as the tagline states it, ""ONE HELL OF A NIGHT!"" Successful in a local run, this film was picked up by the tremendously trashy Troma team, and this may throw off some die-hard film buffs, but if people really know about this hilarious indie gem, they'll die to see it. equipment, and more time, this could have really been something. As it is, I see lots of potential for development and I do not want my 105 minutes back, they were spent happily.

The waste of film consists of a cliché plot which is incredibly scattered, and horrendous acting-even sub-par to USA Up All Night flicks!

Music From Another Room (1998)	really wondering when she's going to go get the recognition she obviously deserves... A great cast all together.The film has a few flaws, the most notable being a rather predictable story, but excellent acting and witty writing more than make up for that. Overall, Music From Another Room is a highly recommendable romantic comedy, far better than most straight-on-video stuff. dying mother, the film works extremely well.  And of course the chemistry between the two leads, Jude Law and Gretchen Mol, is undeniable and provides much of the appeal of the film.

The story moves along nicely, and one event seems to flow naturally into another.My guess is, if there had been an A-List Hollywood star on board, like, eg, Bruce Willis, this little film might have gotten quite a bit more recognition.  But the chemistry would have been completely different.Bring a date and some popcorn, and enjoy. was sweet and endearing. It was how love SHOULD be. Its the kind of romance/friendship/love that everyone looks for. One that is selfless and kind. It is worth watching this movie JUST to see the Nina/Jesus romance.... This movie proves that side romances are indeed the best, because they restore our hope in what seems to be an impossible goal. of himself to the performance. The interesting thing is that the part actually has more potential than roles he has chosen and into which he has thrown a lot of energy.Brenda Blethyn and Jane Adams turn in great performances and one can only wish that Adams and Mol had traded parts.Then again, what do I know?

Mother and Son (Mat i syn) (1997)	"of a fine work of art like this once in my life.I wouldn't presume to recommend a film like `Mother and Son' to everyone, but if you've read the comments posted here and think you might be receptive to this film, as I did, see it by all means.  You'll probably appreciate its power and beauty, as I did. The son says to wait here. And that is what we do in what seems real time. We wait back in the forest with slumbering mother while the camera slowly adjusts our perspective. I wish I had the chance to be with my parents at their deaths. In a sense Sokurov has given me that opportunity in an idealized form. the atmosphere is pure and unhindered by peripheral marks of civilization. Sokurov's 1997 film and his subsequent films OTETS I SYN ('FATHER AND SON') and RUSSKIY KOVCHEG ('RUSSIAN ARK') have established him as one of the most creative filmmakers of today. Highly recommended, especially for those who appreciate art, nature, and the humbling magnificence of the cycle of life.Grady Harp work - the wind, the sea, the ""music"" of the earth, provide a brilliant counterpoint and commentary to what is seen. The look of the film is remarkable, inspired by the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, but while the images are indeed beautiful, they are never merely ""picturesque"". From beginning to end, Mother and Son is a work of genius. seem to coexist like oil and water, pulling one in two directions at once. Of plot, in the normal sense, there is little or none.

Replacement Killers, The (1998)	"if i were producing movies, i'd kick myself for not watching this movie sooner and taking advantage of Mira Sorvino in her prime. it's not too late -- check our her recent IMDb pics. papa sorvino was right -- his daughter is great, and anyone who says otherwise should get a cap in his knee. this movie is the proof. action in this movie, too. Every once in a while I wonder how a small time forger learned to fight and shoot like she does, but then I blissfully ignore it and just enjoy the movie.Great action scenes, wonderful relationship development and great acting by Mira and Yun-Fat Chow make this a movie I'm sure I'll see many more times. in making the movie even more entertaining. The scenery has a very colorful and artistic look to it and the music doesn't get too loud. I think of the movie as ""Lethal Weapon"" made like in the style of John Woo, who is one of the film's producers.""The Replacement Killers"" certainly hits the center of the bulls-eye with hair-raising accuracy. quite well!Still carrying that 90's look, we are treated to 85 minutes of stylish Hong Kong wanna-be shoot outs and angles that sometimes overdoes the John Woo homages - some of which are pretty good, some that just ended up quite slow.Regardless, it was a great introduction to the US audience for HK's coolest actor, and an enjoyable film nonetheless! end. And this is where I have my only point of criticism : The movie is way to short !!! 80 minutes and the credits start to roll!!! You'll almost start to beg for more...

B. Monkey (1998)	"the end, amounts to no more nor less than the sum of its impressionistic moments.  The world is a glittering tomb where we all languish in oh-so-gorgeous isolation, or something.  As Jared Harris says early in the movie, deejaying at a local hospital:  ""This next one is for all you romantics out there.  Get well soon."" are superbly directed but his talent wasn't evident in this film. It's adequately made but besides Argento this was a pretty tepid viewing experience. I had heard rumors that it was heavily edited but I'm not sure thats the problem. The whole film feels flat and labored and really has nothing special to offer. Argento does make it watchable though. is basically carried by the two leads (particularly Asia Argent, daughter of Dario Argento) and by Rupert Everett in a supporting role. The script is average and the plot a tad too obvious at times, but Argento catches fire on camera and does a very good job.  If you like action-thrillers, by all means watch thi one.

Night Flier (1997)	"final, final conclusion is a little weak, but it really couldn't have ended any other way.Overall, the couple flaws drag ""The Night Flier"" down to a good but not great movie, but the really cool climax and other elements make up for it, and make it a good time.  Be warned, it won't leave you feeling happy or good. and remember Richard Dees as what he really was, that is to say a nasty character living on people's suffering. Well, this film is a great B-movie. The story is exciting, Miguel Ferrer is excellent and the film has no Hollywood-like happy ending. I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice thrill and a few gallons of blood. overdose of special effects.Unlike the other reviewers I like the character of Richard Dees-this guy is so wonderfully mean that it's impossible not to like him.The acting is decent and the special effects are okay.As for the gore,there is plenty of blood in ""Night Flier"",but the violence is not excessive.However gore-hounds should be pleased.Make sure you find this one!Highly recommended. a little slow in places and does not really get very good until about a third of the way through. These few faults though aren't really enough to harm the enjoyment and whilst this may not be to everyone's liking I personally believe it to be a well made and appealing movie.

Blues Brothers 2000 (1998)	"but the introduction of a kid to the Blues Brothers Band seemed completely pointless and adds absolutely nothing to the film.The saving grace is the music, with Eric Clapton, BB King, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, etc. and the original Blues Brothers Band, the music is damn good, but this alone is not enough.Thanks for trying, but must try harder. 5/10 the original. In fact all elements from the original are here in slightly inferior forms, with the exception of the car chase, which is better.To be honest, it is worth seeing this film just to see how all the band has aged. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Blues music, though fans of the original may be disappointed and it wasn't mean to be. It's a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers, too. Unfortunately, too many people want ""edgy"" material all the time .Not only are the characters colorful, so is the cinematography, making it both a visual and audio treat. So....just look at it as a blue concert with laughs, and, hopefully, you'll enjoy it. edgier and darker in tone like the original, I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating. Perhaps this film has a little more depth than people expect, so they incorrectly perceive it to be a lackluster and shallow mindnumbing entertainment. I know better .......

Tokyo Fist (Tokyo ken) (1995)	"as Tsukamoto does; the sheer contradiction of city life, in which a great mass of people are all huddled together at close range, and yet find themselves completely lonely and alienated from one another.For all intents and purposes, Tokyo Fist is a movie which requires a strong stomach and an open mind. But it's a great achievement all the same. screen but fortunately the effect is still very strong on television, too. Tokyo Fist is among the most fierce, angry and honest rides of cinema I've ever experienced and everytime I see something from its maker, I cannot help but feel confused and amazed in front of Japan and its invaluable gifts during the centuries to the world of cinema.9/10 a solid core to make it dream a better society.In this light, it makes sense to see Tsukamoto playing a young employee, fresh out of high school and already into a suit and a tie running errands for a faceless corporation, turning into a crazed animal for whom even love is a petulant obsession, another passing need to be consummated. rather short and gains immensely thereby in both concentration and focus.  I, too, thought about Raging Bull at times but probably Tsukamoto is more akin to David Cronenberg (the new flesh) in his concerns, not his approach, than Scorsese.  It may not be for the squeamish, but it is strong, brilliant film making which you should definitely try. dont understand one of the comments here, saying that it was ""infinitely more coherant"" then tetsuo. for one thing the dialogue was so badly translated that they could barely put the most simple of english words in the correct context. i dont mind a complete lack of plot, as long as the ride is interesting. this to me was not.

Ride (1998)	"Cedric the Entertainer, Red Man, Dr Dre, Snoop, Ed Lover, don't do anything other than provide famous faces for the black audience.Overall then just another puerile and unfunny black comedy that trades on basic humour and racial clichés. The only thing more depressing than the film itself is the fact that some people will think this is a great film. movie worth the time to check out if you like urban comedies. Its a hell of a lot better than soul plane and a lot more realistic. Malik Yoba (New York Undercover) Fredro Starr( ""Q"" from Moesha) Kellie Williams (Laura Winslow of ""Family Matters"") and John Witherspoon (The Dad from ""Friday) are the characters that stand out from the cast. who didn't see it and you want to see it go buy it and check it out. Then again this is worth me repeating because It's a movie that was underrated when it came out. When I heard about it I brought it.People you have to really look in stores and check this movie out when you get a chance! happy. Some social things too that are always on top. a fan of Snoop or Dre don't buy this film to see them because Dre says only one sentence and Snoop is only in one scene. As for the jokes they are not very funny but if you are also a fan of black comedies rent before you buy. Also the running time of the film may disappoint some people. "	4.6	0
Wedding Singer, The (1998)	"goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. of the movie (to me) are those that play to Robbie's broken heart; it's probably the best depiction of the depression of the newly-dumped I've ever seen (in particular, I love the ""Kill Me Please"" song). Hey, I've been there.This all being said, however, I think the touch-all-the-landmarks-of-the-mid-'80s approach gets awfully heavy-handed at times. The musical choices, though, were excellent. cameo appearance by Billy Idol. The air plane ""proposal"" is a sweet highlight, you'll love it! The soundtrack (all hits of the mid 80s) is a nice touch, too. From ""Love Stinks"" to ""99 Luftballoons"" it's all there. -- This is my favorite Adam Sandler movie. Treat yourself to a bag-a-laughs and a few mushy moments, this is top entertainment! portray the roles. It is funny and has plenty of memorable lines. And if this isn't enough for you to shout ""WAHOO!"" the chemistry between Julia and Robbie is right on and I'm surprised they aren't dating in real life. This is a great romantic comedy so just watch it without any questions! It has become one of my favorites. and forced.  Thankfully, the Wedding Singer steers clear from that, and actually allows you to have an emotional stake in the characters.Sadly, the movie is slightly forgettable, as it merely succeeds in its goals but fails to impress.  However, it's great fun while it lasts and you'll always have a fond, if somewhat faded, memory of the movie. "	6.8	0
Sphere (1998)	"is a visual treat...and the atmosphere is rightly captured, with nice music.Overall, I think the movie is worth watching and is definitely of a much higher caliber than 'The Lost World'. It follows a psychological-cum-sci-fi thriller theme and i feel is better than the similar flick 'Abyss'. As from the novel's point-of-view...it could have been done better though. 8/10 stars! by the action integrated in The Abyss, but Sphere far surpasses it in terms of plot.  Most of all, if you like films that simply entertain, this is not for you.  It's more about the reactions it causes in you when you follow the story.  If you come away from this film unchanged, you've missed the point. underwater environment come alive. The film is a psycological mystery thriller that keeps you guessing to the very end. It has good dialogue and is more concerned with characters and their development than with cool looking ways of killing them off. Based on Michael Crichton's book, Sphere is a breath of fresh air in a genre that really needs it. the entire film, it will leave you feeling a little disturbed at times, and perhaps a bit paranoid, also.I would advice anyone who does not have a liking to intense sci-fi type films...this is not going to be your cup of tea, but for those enjoy good horror, intensity and a great story line, you will definitely enjoy this flick! all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's ""Event Horizon,"" which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's ""The Abyss"" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary. "	6.1	0
Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life (1997)	"The film concludes on a lingering shot of a poster for Atlas Shrugged,""Don't call it hero worship: it's a kind of white heat where philosophy becomes religion.""

There's a name for it, its called love. Rands ""individualism"" is suicidal for the individual, the family and society. I'm rating this film so low because it does little more than promote these ill gotten ideas. intertwined with cut-throat capitalism that has become today's Republican party. If you are interested in learning the main points about Ayn Rand's life, this is a good source for the facts and even some insights - particularly good are the clips from her appearances on the Donahue show shortly before her death. However, realize that this biography is somewhat sanitized. ideas comes from Allen Greenspan, a Rand acolyte who when asked to explain why he allowed the country's economy to run itself into the ground, stated that he couldn't fathom that bankers would act in their own self-interest without concern for the well-being of the nation.

Palmetto (1998)	"Heat.'"" Well, that's fine with me because I liked ""Body Heat"" a lot, too. If you liked that, you should like this movie, too.Yes, there are a few holes in the story but nothing that damaged the storyline to any degree. Woody Harrelson was good in the lead and Gina Gershon and Michael Rapaport provided solid performance in supporting roles. the lead and Sevigny is very good as the rich kid, although Elizabeth Shue tends to overact her part. The biggest crime in this film is that of Gina Gershon, who seems wasted in a weak role as Harry's girlfriend. The film on a whole is good though, and because of this you can almost forgive a 'Batman' style ending! words, she's miscast), I personally cannot understand how anyone can claim to be a mystery fan and not like this movie. Absorbing storytelling (which takes its time), some tense moments (the body in the car trunk) and many great, totally unpredictable surprises that even the most hardened genre buffs will not guess. Riveting and interesting from beginning to end. (***) located in sunny places. It has a sort of kinship relation with George Stevens' A Place in the Sun. And it has a quite good Woody Harrelson in the leading role. Sweat plays more than a role in the plot: characters are sweating all the time (mainly Harry Barber), for different reasons. May be that's why some people dislike it. urgency).Nevertheless the plot is unusual and nothing is what it looks. All seems like a normal thriller in which the roles of everybody are the typical ones but the surprises that unfold in the last minutes make it a watchable twist around a theme many times explored before.The superb luscious ladies and the unusual plot make it a good watch, "	6.0	0
As Good As It Gets (1997)	"occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997. in ""stopping with taking pills"" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, ""As Good As It Gets"" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of **** are acting out. Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of 1997.                     Rating: Four stars. after so many years of acid-tongued insults?  I don't know.  I know people who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what.  Personally, I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander.  Maybe it's a sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but laugh as he takes on everyone. continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together.  A superior piece of sentimentality. "	7.7	1
King of New York (1990)	headed from the start, personally found myself excited and in awe of how it got there and honestly didn't see the end coming. It goes far beyond where others dare to go and still keeps it real.In the end I find myself thinking, this is the kind of film 'The Untouchables' and 'Carlito's Way' didn't have the balls to be! punk and the drug deal scene is one of the films many highlights. What impressed me most about this film is that not one scene is wasted. It is short, sharp, action packed and to the point and it is one of those rare gems that actually has a fantastic ending.Well done Ferrara, this movie is one of the greats. following. Considering the cast and the directorial talent, this is no surprise. Ferrara makes an entertaining film which, though it doesn't offer a great deal of new material, offers some unique characterizations and avoid devolving into straight action.Highly recommended for fans of Walken, Fishburne, Caruso and Ferrara. Recommended for crime drama and gangsta film fans. Weakly recommended for Snipes fans. local authorities re-act to his new found activities? Will his soldiers remain loyal? What will his rivals do? To find out you'll just have to watch it!!I found this movie to be very good. Abel Ferrara has found his niche audience and he should cater to it. He has a style that a director like Martin Scorese once had.Highly recommended. burroughs.............Much congrats to Alex Tovoularis' production design.King of New York may not be as famous as Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant in the world of the cinema-geek, but maybe it should be.Joe Delia's haunting soundtrack is a perfect compliment to Bojan Bazelli's moody visuals-Walken's confrontation scene of the old-style Mafiosos is as classic as it is intense.Man, do I love this movie. 	7.0	0
Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in America, A (1998)	"to be addressed.I expect that the full length version of this film would have included mention of the condition ""post-polio syndrome"" which I friend of mine suffers. Every few years she endures recurring bouts of severe weakness and agonising pain - and the big obstacle to finding treatment is that very few hospital personnel even know that the condition exists. any clear-thinking person could rationally object to the notion of vaccines. Yet, sadly, some folks are using purely anecdotal and emotional support to encourage parents NOT to vaccinate. My answer to this...WATCH THIS FILM. If this doesn't convince you, nothing will. Seeing folks in iron lungs is enough to convince me...as well as that pesky thing called the scientific method. "	7.9	1
Men with Guns (1997)	"see it twice. Those who are critical of American film, believing it can never equal the philosophical attainments of European film, should see this film.  Few films have dealt with eschatological issues as assuredly as this one:  The Seventh Seal, Persona, Cold Fever, Forbidden Games, are some that have, and this magnificent film is very much their equal. come to realize that the entire story is being told, like a traditional myth, by a Mayan mother to her little girl.  A beautiful example of the Latin American ""magical realism"" style.   This film gets an unhesitating score of 10 from me... in fact, I think I may consider this film among my lifetime top ten movies. real, they may not have the same names, but they do exist.  Even the war vets who have gone to levels so low we cannot even imagine. If you would like to understand what went on in Southern Mexico and Guatemala during the 80's, I would strongly recommend this film.  It left a very strong impression on me. not- subtitles alone guarantee a fringe  audience confined to a few art houses. The film is not perfect- editing could be a little better; but what a story! The opening and closing scenes really work for me.  I hope  everyone reading these comments will go out and rent Men with Guns ASAP. Sayles at  his best.

Twilight (1998)	"a certain age everywhere! It is a film that probably plays better on TV than in a movie house. The pace is leisurely but there is some nice sharp dialogue and atmospheric camera work. All this plus a moody score by Leonard Bernstein make for a highly professional entertainment. The more I think about it the more I like it.  The score is excellent; the story line captivating.  Paul Newman is indeed more than believable in his role as a sexy, no-nonsense gumshoe.  Susan Sarandon is sultry in the style of Susan Hayward and Lauren Bacall.  Gene Hackman is, well, Gene Hackman. I only wish there were more movies coming out of Hollywood of this nature. reminded me of L.A.Confidential in the story line, but this film's characters have depth and texture, unlike the cardboard cutouts of that movie. The gritty plot, about past crime, betrayal, friendship, and loyalty, is not without its moments of sardonic humor, and Elmer Bernstein, who has been around forever, still churns out a great score. A grownup movie for grownups. and Philip Marlowe lived to be seventy? A genuine hard-boiled detective film forty years later. The myth behind Newman's accident is hilarious. A must see! his curmudgeon character from ""Nobody's Fool"" but instead he played a very different richly complex character. Kudos also to the rest of the nearly all-star cast. One important plot element absolutely jumped out at me, even though none of the characters seemed to notice, but aside from that I have no complaints. Reese Witherspoon was particularly beautiful here. Grade: A "	6.2	0
U.S. Marshals (1998)	Left the biz? If the former, and he's in NYC, then we'll probably see him on a Law & Order episode one of these days! I recently found a DVD with tons of extras on it  but I have not as yet delved into them. I look forward to doing that, as I do another viewing of the film. able to fit into the role with relative ease.The action sequences, as I said, is very well done and never over done. They are fast-paced and well acted. The special effects are also quite believable. With the excellent acting, gripping plot, and fast paced action sequences, the two hours fly by and make for a very enjoyable film.3 1/2/5 Stars sensational musical score by the veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Awesome cinematography by Andrzej Bartkowiak ( sometimes filmmaker ) . The film is finely directed by Stuart Baird ( an usual and famed film editor ) . The motion picture will appeal to triller enthusiasts and starring duo fans . Rating : Above average . It's essential and indispensable watching . even better. The same goes for a few other scenes. There is more action in this film. Normally, I don't need that but it's so well-done here, it's fine....fun to watch.The Fugitive is still one of my all-time favorite movies. If you were entertained by it as well but are wary of sequels, you needn't be here: this is excellent. FanFiction writing and an online 'funeral' held by the fans, believe it or not!So if you are a great lover of the work that Tommy Lee Jones produces, or you just like a cool action movie, U.S. Marshals is a good step away from reality. Sit Back and relax with your coffee and chocolate doughnut with the sprinkles on top! 	6.5	0
Welcome to Woop-Woop (1997)	only to walk into a much bleaker situation  a kind of time-warp - where Daddy-O is the law, the judge, and the executioner. Rule number one: no-one escapes from Woop Woop.Unfairly criticized as vulgar and offensive, many have missed what this film is all about. Properly understood, however, this makes for highly entertaining (if somewhat foreboding) viewing. Great stuff! the stereotypical Aborigine. Cockatoos, dunnies(outhouses), the VW van, the backyard tip (dump), the brand of beer (it's real), Rogers and Hammerstein films, kangaroos as Aboriginal spirits, kangaroos as dog meat (true, not good, but true), even the main character's dog ( a Blue Heeler, Australian Cattle Dog), and the reference to the beach. They have nailed this film. 10 stars! and marries you while you are passed out. Then she takes you to live on a compound deep in the outback that is run by her charismatic and psychotic father. Played incredibly by Rod Taylor. OK that is enough, you have to watch the rest and you will be happy that you did. This movie is eye and ear candy! sitcoms are your thing, you just won't get this film. It's bizarre, shocking (if you shock easily), wildly funny, and atmospheric. Is there something about this film that is uniquely Australian? Probably not, this had to have been a bizarre and disturbing dream, or a psychotic episode scripted. It's great entertainment, and certainly an escape from reality. It's a 10 nude scenes.  Also Rod Taylor chews the scenery again, and again, and again, and AGAIN as Daddy-O--the leader of the town.  It does lag a little at the end and it's definetely not for all tastes but totally off-beat and fun--particularly the opening in NYC and the last scene with...well, you'll know!

The story is punctuated with little episodes of wry humour brought about by people who live entirely different lives.Altogether a very satisfying film that shows how some of us live in a cocoon unaware of the extreme joy and subsequent disappointment that lies beyond. performance from Hurt that holds our gaze. Dignified, perplexed and slightly tragic, Hurt makes Giles one of the most touching ""stalkers"" in film history. Much like James Mason's Humbert in Lolita, Giles is a man of culture finding beauty in youth, in coarseness - in ""all that I myself have never been.""Ultimately, a slow, witty work with one outstanding feature. bit foolish. What's the point in using public money to promote your local landscape and character when people think its somewhere else? It's true most films can be made anywhere (look what comes out of Fox in Sydney) but in some films the geography is crucial. I just hope they don't make ""Shipping News"" in Long Island instead of Newfoundland.  He stumbles upon the work of Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley, in a heckuva good, self-effacing performance) and sees in him talent and passion.  That's about all I can say without going too far into plot - but if I were able to physically compel people to see it, I certainly would.  It's a lovely piece of work.  are a lot of interesting ideas about the nature of love, and about how even the most set in their ways can suddenly find a new lease of life.This is a film that rewards more than one viewing.

Everest (1998)	does with unfortunate brevity, and worst of all, the association of the film with Krakauer's book gives some viewers the impression that they know what happened on the mountain just because they have seen this film. No one who has not read Into Thin Air has any right whatsoever to criticize anything that happened on Mt. Everest in May 1996. each other (a scene that would have worked just fine if shot on plain old videotape). In summation, this film has some truly amazing moments, but as a whole, it seems the creators failed to use the IMAX format to the maximum potential. PS: The DVD version contains lots of good supplementary material, in fact, the `making of the film' in the long run, only himself, as he was not guiding the peak or responsible for any other climbers at the time.I loved the movie; every time I see it I get chills at the stunning Breashears images of the mountain.I definitely recommend seeing this movie. It represents both the darker, dangerous side of mountaineering and the light, triumphant side. However, you hardly hear about them... might disappoint, but I'm not sure why.This isn't supposed to be the final word on what Everest is like, it's a picture of the ascent of one team, and what it takes to get there.After seeing this gorgeous film I want to try for Everest myself in a few years.

Hush (1998)	"cleans him, they're like pretending it's just a silly joke. There's something going on there).I know Jonathan Darby has directed better films (like the criminally underrated and almost forgotten ""The Enemy Within"" with Forest Whitaker) but what he makes here is quite good, never cheap and at the most entertaining to watch for its cast and the beautiful cinematography. 8/10 got from the IMDB users, i didn't expect too much. I only watched it to see Gywneth Paltrow. Indeed, the first half of the film was not too impressive. The scenes tended to be fragmented. As more of the plot was unveiled, the film became intense and engaging. I think this film deserves slightly more points than it has got. off by the happy ending from a lower budget, non-mainstream film, but what do I know?Well, I know I liked it more than it's rated on here, and I'd recommend it to friends. A masterpiece, it isn't, but I'd consider it entertaining and worthy of your time if you like mystery/thrillers set mostly in beautiful country surroundings with good acting. Kate Winslet's part in Titanic at the time she committed to this project, devles into her role as the unsuspecting fiancee with grace and down to earth affability. But this is clearly Jessica Lange's film. Her psychotic mother-in-law is one of the most disturbing characters I have come across in any film. In my opinion this film rates an 8/10. one where Helen gets out of bed naked and meets her mother-in-law for the first time. That one was edited for TV in such a way it seemed kind of jerky and I didn't get to see much, but a lot depends on how one sees this movie.It's not typical of what I like in a movie, but still entertaining.

I really love this movie.  See it if you haven't.  : )~ (what a funny name!).I said it once and I'll say it again -- ""Suicide Kings"" is a darkly comical film, but it is highly recommended (for those with kids) that you watch this either late at night or while the kids are away.I give ""Suicide Kings"" a 10 out of 10 on a scale of 1-10 in my humble opinion. well.  I was unsure of what the movie would be like and so my expectations were low.  At the end I had done an 180 degree turn. I was impressed. I look forward to watching this again and picking up on all the clues as to who was doing what and seeing the small details from the start. but I surely would disregard it as decent entertainment either.  I would call it a really good movie.  Chris Walken is fantastic and the dialouge is great.  Come to find out this is Peter O'Fallon's first film, and that he has only done one other film since (he's done a bunch of television), I'm surprized and impressed. experience winning out over precocious recreation with criminal chicanery!!

But The Man In The Iron MASK is DEFINITELY a movie worth giving a try. the iron mask off his face and he's still pretty! Eh, still I'd highly recommend it, it's the actors that make this movie very delightful to watch, one for all and all for one... this movie is just tons of fun! Hey, that almost rhymes, I made a funny! OK, there's my cheesy joke, I'm done, just watch the movie.8/10 of little consequence here... The film, however, is not exactly faithful when it comes to historical facts... It has been created for pleasant entertainment purposes... Louis XIV of France, whose great prestige earned him the title of 'the Sun King', ruled France in one of its most brilliant periods and remains the symbol of absolute monarchy of the classic age... all of the Titanic hype was still taking place.  Perhaps The Man in the Iron Mask should've been released in the fall of 98--I bet more people would've gone to see it in theaters.  If you haven't seen this film, rent it.  It's both an enjoyable story and a visual wonder.  See it at least twice! of performing. The mask was perhaps the most attractive bit of metal put together in any movie version.

Nevertheless, the film is as a whole better than the most recent of its kind. It has an innocent-like quality to it thanks to the fervent belief of Willis Newtown: doing this was simply a way to make money and for that reason there was no reason for them to stop. same way a fictional story would. It's not a huge problem, but it's noticeable, especially if you've seen a lot of gangster films.In the end The Newton Boys is well worth a watch if you're into the idea that sometimes real life is more exciting than any movie and/or if you're looking for a good gangster/robber movie to check out. brothers are about to rob is particularly cool. The whole cadre things are set in, including the jaunty music, is conventional, but it's undeniably fun. The movie's a little long, but the climactic later scenes are involving. But still, this is very far from Linklater at his best, and Rosenbaum ought to admit he erred in ranking it so high. with the brother's characters.

Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and, on the whole, if you want a couple of hours of entertainment; you can do a lot, lot worse than this twisty little flick. just might find that Wild Things is a fun ride.Because there are, it's true, a number of twists and turns, and not everyone sees them coming. And if you aren't a twist-spotter, but you enjoy movies with twists, then you are going to enjoy this one.I thought it was great fun. And, let's be fair, who's watching Denise Richards' acting? are realistic enough to keep the audience engaged.The other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are done very well, too. That is, they are unobtrusive.This really is a thoroughly entertaining film, and while it does contain one rather steamy scene, is not a cheap sex film, but a well-thought out, well-executed story. I highly recommend it. tale that fails to stretch credibility, but its is a film for amusement. But unlike so many, the mystery is solvable and does not rely on contrivances created at the end to make you feel stupid. If you miss them you are not stupid, but if foresee any of the conclusion, and the can be foreseen, hats off to you. has an good moody music score by George S. Clinton (Austin Powers Trilogy) and striking camera work by Jeffery L. Kimball (Jacob's Ladder, Stigmata, True Romance) are one of the highlights of this guilty pleasure film.

Paulie (1998)	"story even more. And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. (Unlike in star wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug. son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human. You root for him all the way through the movie.You can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!! film and understanding that Birds, especially Parrots are not disposable pets. All children everywhere, will see that Pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.so no BABE here, more of an incredible journey with a twist.Enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts. a laboratory, where he is befriended by an introverted Russian immigrant, played by the wonderful Tony Shalhoub. I won't give away the end of the film, but it'll bring tears to your eyes. You won't believe you are crying about a parrot!  A nice little movie that'll make you laugh and cry and give you a feeling of hope! in ""How the Grinch stole Christmas""... it was plain bad training). The Paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too. Not more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE!My ratings: story 8.5/10, acting 7.5/10, animals+fx 8.5/10, cinematography 8/10.My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING!

Cool, Dry Place, A (1998)	"thankless, complex role. The rest of the cast is up to par as well, the costumes well-chosen and the grassland setting most beautiful. In short, you may never have heard of this film but it is richly rewarding and deserves a large audience. You will not be in a ""high and dry"" situation if you bring this film home tonight. while Potter's effort is sincere (she did have the harder part) but it is Vince Vaughn's film. The actor is outstanding. All the actors share a good chemistry that shines on screen. On the whole this 'A Cool, Dry Place' is a nice warm film but it's not one that stayed after ending. Perhaps I should give it another chance. rolled!!! If you see no other Vaughn movie this one is a must! Not only is the story great, but Vince is gentle and compassionate; a father that takes his job as a parent most seriously. The angst in his day-to-day struggle as a parent and a man will leave you thinking about parenthood long after the movie has ended! The kid is rather bratty and bitter. It's not unreasonable but it's off-putting. The movie tries to give him some humor with the female anatomy but it doesn't really work. Vaughn has the same feel. The three leads are great. It might be useful to see what happened in Chicago. Something is wrong with this movie but it's nothing glaring. He has to reorganize his life in order to raise his son. This movie shows what sacrifices you have to make as a single parent in order to raise your kids.Fans of Vince Vaughn will be pleasantly surprised by this movie. It shows a different side of him, a side that I hope he shows more of in other movies. "	6.3	0

It complements the story in soothing tempo from beginning to end. Kitano's ""FIREWORKS"" is in perfect cadence -- an excellent piece of film expression. A rare gem. York' and 'Bad Lieutenant'. 'Hana-bi' reminds me of those movies but Takeshi adds his own unique voice to the material. I was knocked out by it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to movie fans who are fascinated by the relationship between art and violence. I don't think calling this movie a masterpiece is an exaggeration. Absolutely essential viewing! a wheel chair, and Kayoko Kishimoto is great in the lovable role of Nishi's dying wife.An absolute genius as a writer, director and actor, Takeshi Kitano is without doubt one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents alive, as far as I am concerned he is one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents who have ever lived.

What is admirable, what is not acceptable, what is it we really *want* in our public officials? I don't think ""Primary Colors"" will change anyone's opinion of the Clintons (in the final analysis, it isn't about them at all) -- but it is a very funny as well as thought-provoking look at modern American politics. opus. Last, but not least, Adrian Lester is the idealist young African American in charge of his campaign. This impassioned portrayal bodes well to a successful future in films. Mike Nichols has directed Miss May's script with intelligence and humor. See it now, after all the gossiping has died down, for an insightful, entertaining glimpse into the world of politics. unfortunately sullied by a series of mind-numbing duds (Battlefield Earth, anyone?), yet had he chosen his roles more wisely (as, say, Pacino has done) a more creditable media image would most certainly have been forthcoming.Don't be put off by its subject matter: this is film making at its best and is a credit to its highly talented cast and crew.10/10 example of the hardened believer.  Finally came the eloquent and insane Libby Holden given breath in this mortal coil by the infallible Kathy Bates.  I couldn't even begin to describe the beauty of this character's idealism.

So there ya go. of that endangerment of human understanding driven home through a pair of incredible performances that are not to be missed.Niagra Niagra is an incredible film which is a MUST see, and don't worry about being ""sold"" the latest line of merchandise.

Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcy suffering from Tourette's Sydrome, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses. This movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it. "	7.1	0
Wide Awake (1998)	"ten-year-olds' can have deeper thoughts and views than adults give them credit for and I think many of us can empathise with how childlike wonder slowly gives way to adult insights as we grow up and leave childhood behind. This isn't a film just for the religious but those who are interested in a realistic depiction of a child's coming-of-age. there.  It was so true to life that I found myself wondering how much of it was based on the film writer's own experiences.  Above all, I was impressed by the amount of respect the movie seems to have for boys, and by its willingness to recognize that 5th graders sometimes think deep thoughts and ask deep questions. Shyamalan was kind of disappointed with it over-all, and I think that he should re-consider that thought. He states that he wants people to somehow be touched by and to identify with the work that he produces and this movie does exactly that! It hits home on all different levels for young and old.This is a must see for families!! We can only guess what ""Unbreakable"" may hold for us.Great actors and writing in this one, regardless.  It is very much the story of young Josh and his search for God, and is not at all a Rosie O'Donnell movie as you may have been led to believe.  Well worth watching.  Denis Leary never looked so nerdy. really good job of waking us up. I cried and I laughed. Each time I cried it was real and sad, but each time I laughed it was heartfelt and even if for a fraction of a second that laugh made me happy. It is hard to find a quality movie that is able to invoke such an emotional response. "	6.1	0
Price Above Rubies, A (1998)	the scene was done the way it was, but it incorrectly portrayed a very private and sacred part of Jewish life.I was deeply affected by this independent film targeted to a fairly limited audience.  Renee Zellweger, a Catholic/Episcopalian Texas native, turned in a remarkable performance, and got many of the nuances right, as did many of the other performers. the matters at hand to every viewer's satisfaction, but it's honest, and consistent with the rest of the story.  What minor flaws the film may contain can be easily overlooked in light of Zellweger's memorable performance, and the fact that it proffers an emotionally complex and involving experience, especially for the discerning viewer.  I rate this one 8/10. (um hmmm) - absolutely everything about the movie was so spot on it was eerie - even down to the Yiddish-isms, accents and dress.It brought back a lot of unpleasant memories...but that is only a testament to how authentic the film really was. In terms of storyline, content, acting, music - I thought it was excellent, hence the 10* rating. in New York and Brooklyn and shows its strengths and weaknesses. The jewelry business is depicted as neither black nor white, but a series of grays.This is a great film and Rene Zellweger should be toasted for risking much and achieving more. Carol Kane was wonderful in Hester Street and Amy Irving likewise in Crossing Delancy. But Rene Zellweger soars. every-day practice, the 'law' everyone lives by and to which everyone abides without questioning. Hence a break from the norm is considered high treason.

Two Girls and a Guy (1997)	with what the female characters in this movie did, at least the movie makes the oft-overlooked point that sex isn't everything, a point seldom made in movies, and often made in life.  Though it is certainly not an exceptional movie, it is worth seeing, and an interesting look into the privileged status sex has attained in our modern society. in the first scene and what follows is a verbal confrontation between the three in which they discuss love, sex, commitment, truth, yadda-yadda.I'm not knocking it; the movie is really very good.  The three actors work very well together in what is sometimes fine improvisation.  Definitely worth the rental when you are in the mood for something different. final scene of the movie floored me.  I''m not sure how to use the word pathos properly but that final scene exudes it.  But before that the whole movie is an excellent examination of an actor who can't stop acting and the two girlfriends and mother he loves. Very witty and exciting to watch.  I loved it. NY loft.I was never aware of RDJ's talent for singing, piano, and theatrical performances.There are a couple of graphic moments, but all in all, it's a GREAT movie. Anyone who loves RDj, should most definately give this one a chance.  Even though I hate Heather Graham, with a passion, I am able to watch this movie, over and over. but worth saying) Downey Jr. is masterful in adlibbing and improvising. He accomplishes what Brando failed to do in Last Tango in Paris. Downey is real. His problems, his inner angst, his troubles all surface. This is like being with him. His magic and charm are entrancing and enchanting.  Pretty cool. Worth a watch late at night- intense though. 	5.6	0
No Looking Back (1998)	"is one movie never mentioned in highlights of her career, and I think it's a shame. Burns clearly pulled together people of talent for this small, focused movie, and as an independent movie with an independent feel it rises above its smallness. I have a feeling it will survive over the years and continue to be interesting for its honesty. my girlfriend stayed out with another guy until 5 a.m., I would think my voice would show a little more inflection at least).Anyway, if you are from this area and want to ""go home again"", rent this movie. If you aren't and want to see what it's like, see this movie. If you liked any major blockbuster this year, pass. very subdued and could have used some form of life injected to it.Cast is mostly excellent. Holly is terrific, Burns good as usual but most unexpected; Bon Jovi is actually quite effective as Holly's unfortunate boyfriend.Praise goes also to the excellent music score. There's not one but three Springsteen songs and in my books that indicates some good musical taste. whether to try to follow those dreams or just go on with her comfortable life in the small town of her birth. Burns arrives as her former boyfriend, a dreamer who did leave to chase his dreams and found he couldn't catch them. Our heroine sees what could have been, what would be and chooses what could be. Nice ending. between him and Robin, he was so believable, I just wanted to hold him.Great stor line.

Storefront Hitchcock (1997)	"on the video ""Gotta Let This Hen Out!"" - great, if weird rock, the subjects may be mordid, but the tone is optimistic. Zoom to 1996 and the boyish cult star has become a greyhaired, matured solo-artist, offering introspective, haunting tales of death and despair. There's an almost majestic sadness to songs like ""Glass Hotel"", ""You and Oblivion"". Highly recommended. aging impersonator of himself, like so many of his peers! He is the modern day Dali of the spoken word & you can gather that from any project he's released to date.

Where Talking Heads stimulate your brain while activating your dancing shoes, Hitchcock teases, confounds, and animates your brain while stealing your heart. He's also an entertaining acoustic and electric guitarist.Mr. Demme, may I humbly suggest a Jazz Butcher film next? does have it's own distinct flavour, perhaps unsuprising considering it has such a colourful artist as its subject. It never reaches the exhilarating levels of seeing Stop Making Sense in a movie theatre but Demme should be congratulated for having the smarts, ability and just plain good taste to bring such a unique talent to the big screen. Miles Pieri had the good fortune to seem him twice in concert.  This replicated those experiences.You can't truly appreciate Robyn by just listening to a CD.  He has such a unique outlook on everything and tells the most interesting stories.That's what makes the movie valuable as a chronicle of Robyn.

Object of My Affection, The (1998)	"Jennifer Aniston is fantastic as a single woman who becomes pregnant and wants to raise the child with her roommate George, who is gay. Unfortunately for her, she ends up falling in love with him. This sets up what is a nonstandard ending to a romance movie, but the payoff is satisfying enough that you aren't in the least disappointed. book.  I also disagree with the assertion that George was ""boring"" in this movie.  I thought that Paul Rudd gave a wonderful and moving performance, particularly at the Science Fair when he tells Nina how much he would love to be a father.  Don't believe the critics -- give it a rental.  It's a terrific film. pure formula, but the results are occasionally offbeat, squirrelly, sometimes funny and moving. Story thread with Nigel Hawthorne as an elderly gay man who gets dumped-on shows the casual cruelty inherent in gay relationships, and this is handled with quiet taste. Not everything works in ""Affection"", but it is remarkably pleasant and (for better or worse) hetero-friendly. *** from **** you think no one else could do a better portrait of Nina and George - they were born to do it. Anyone can relate to them at some point. Congratulations not only for the two, but also for the entire crew who made this movie - including, of course, the great sensibility of director Nicholas Hytner. A job well done. to find it, keep it, and occasionally break our hearts over it. Like other beautiful movies of this kind (eg, While You Were Sleeping, French Kiss) the comedy is fairly subtle and character-based.

Being a horror fan it was inevitable I would dislike this movie. The only reason I bothered watching it is because it features the mouth-wateringly sexy A.J Langer, who also starred in Wes Craven's excellent ""The People Under The Stairs"". She is the only real reason for watching this film. One to avoid on practically all levels. girl about this, but who wouldn't want to see a movie w/ Paul Walker shirtless? This movie by no means stresses his acting ability, but he looks great. Warning: Some scenes involving AJ Langer will make you want to hurl. But of course, that is what the fast-forward button is for.I recommend it for Paul Walker fans and immature people. watch ""Meet the Deedles"" if there's nothing on TV. But I don't recommend it to you as a good film, but rather an awful one. See it and witness pure stinkiness on film. Whatever it tried to steal from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" is not apparent. Whatever was stolen was not stolen properly. .5/5 stars (half a star).John Ulmer thinking whatsoever to watch. This was the ideal thing. It's cringe worthy and very tacky at times but that doesn't mean it's absolute rubbish.

It is not so much a comedy as a quirky drama, like Treasure, though its point is not as sharp at the end. You should see Treasure (again) before or after seeing this. NOT glorify the use and distribution of marijuana (many would like to argue that point) but merely uses it as a backdrop for what is going on.  Give it a run.  I especially reccommend this one to Billy Bob Thornton fans.  He is so perfect in his role that you can almost smell the weed on him. hard to see what the trouble is about. The producers tried to sell this as a ""comedy"", and there are plenty of laughs, but don't wait for canned laughter or any other cues. There are several marijuana inspired songs, Bob Marley's ""Smoke Two Joints"" and Musical Youth's ""Pass The Dutchie"", just to name two.It is more of a caper/suspense/comedy movie. and turns!

Barney's Great Adventure (1998)	"facilities and the Dino-characters are more annoying than the squeakiest Pokemon you could imagine. This is a perfect example of an opportunity to make a good film out of an already successful television character squandered by lazy production and lack of funding. You would likely get more use from 5 dollars by eating it than spending it on this DVD. (e.g. the sullen boy accidentally stepping on a cow pie). was sad and anxious most of the movie.The ""plot"" is nothing but a serious of perilous events, one after another, with the occasional (and out of place) Barney song interlude.Adults will hate everything about this movie. The movie is also very dark and hard to see much of the time.I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even Barney fans. sorry for children whose parents make them watch this . My own childhood adventure revolved around Saturday nights when I watched DOCTOR WHO and I think I can speak for everyone in the western world when I say sadistic monsters made out of condoms by the BBC are far more interesting than a man dressed up as a purple dinosaur it). What made this movie worse (despite the appearance of the big purple thing itself) are the songs, the plot holes and Trevor Morgan. Seeing him explained a lot of things. He was in JP/// and so was Barney... Overall, if my comments made sense, you should stay away from this piece of crap, unless your life depended on it. "	2.9	0
Big One, The (1997)	"such sad facts. But this is the virtue of Michael Moore and this film: it doen't leave you desperate, it gives you a laugh at the time and maybe, if we're all lucky, it will lead to a better organisation of the people concerned and to more resistance against the 1 percent of the rich keeping the rest in poverty. lack of government control on power-mad corporations that only look at the bottom line and constantly talk about competition in their industry (this makes the big-wigs look even sillier in reality). The main theme from ""Pulp Fiction"" late during Moore's run of metropolitan areas ends up setting the overall tone of this exceptional documentary feature. 5 stars out of 5. for getting into the middle of activity and is a great raconteur, but for someone so relentlessly pure on hammering at the same anti-capitalist drum he leaves his own success conspicuously unexamined. The ragbag style is always entertaining though and the film has an appealing zippy pace - reservations aside, the uncertain encounter with Knight makes for a good climax. usually very controversial and direct are inter-cut with what appears to be a stand-up performance by him, which adds a sense of closeness that means a lot for the effect of the film. Not as memorable and interesting as Bowling or Fahrenheit, but most definitely worth watching. I recommend this to any fan of Michael Moore and humorous documentaries. 8/10 of the cities that Moore goes to on his tour. The story that surrounds Nike, Inc. is absolutely worth watching. Corporate business is analyzed throughout this film and Michael Moore makes it a point to have the audience think about what they are watching.

You really do feel that deep down, if circumstances allowed, she'd love Irons back.  Cheung's role is mostly a symbolic one, but she handles it well.  Not an easy film to watch, but moving. all the cultural differences and barriers, is captured from a very close range. It's done almost like a documentary and strongly effects any spectator. The characters are complete, the story also, and everything else in the movie (from the photography and the music to the actual footage of HK and its people) only makes it more powerful. A beautiful movie. much like the people of Hong Kong worried about suppression of their freedoms. Each shot of the movie included something symbolic.

I truly admired this movie and the captivating web it has weaved. story of which the Director should be proud, although I read an interview with him a while ago, and he didn't want to talk about the film, since it's upset some people in Hong Kong, I think. This film is certainly better than most rubbish that's made in Hong Kong. I urge you to find a copy and see it. Li Gong is an enigmatic Chinese Hepburn, and Ruben Blades and Maggie Chang fill in two memorable supporting roles and another lateral story that fits well in the mosaic. 'Chinese Box' catches both a moment to remember in history and a beautiful love story to remember as well, on the background of a world in transition to an unknown destination. 	6.3	0

Especially when both he and the scriptwriter concede that the device of using the ""older Will Robinson"" didn't work on the screen as it did in writing.   It never occurs to them that maybe the scene would have worked if this new character sprung on us was someone with a definable connection to the old show. a shame. Those of us who loved the sixties television series deserved better. If you are partial to any of the cast members, from Hurt to Graham to Oldman, do make time for this film, someday. They are the reason to see this movie, for they are a joy to watch, even in a film as lame as this one. taking in all the old camp elements and putting them to very good use - even using some old catch phrases in different ways.As diversionary, light sci-fi adventure goes, I thought this was great and I'm usually very picky about this kind of thing. It was fun and a pretty good kids' movie.The only thing really missing was Billy Mumy. could or he struck out in a totally different direction, such as what happen when they made Wanted Dead Or Alive for the big screen.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it. vehicle to the ""good"" part.As for Crowe, well, fans may enjoy, but no one's really given enough time or lines to shine in this movie.  Or establish believable relationships for that matter.  They're grim characters on a silent march to their doom, leaving a path of carnage and (I must insist quite relevant) dead bystanders in their wake. There are thematic (and landscape) shifts, accurate and slightly ugly social commentary, a little philosophizing, Afghan woman with hijaab as computer hacker, and tasty Aussie back-country scenes (the corner country bar, B&S dance), and some father/son dynamics to go with typical on the lam love developing. So see this movie, I bet you'll find things you like about it too. looking like a drama, quickly turns into a crime thriller and frequently delivers elements of black comedy - with a nice little love story running through the middle of it all. The funny walk-ons (especially Colin Hay and his accordian) make the movie, and once you realise that you shouldn't take it seriously it's highly enjoyable. Wierd but worth watching. for me it is quite effective. The story is told very well. There are funny moments, touching moments, and enough action/violence to keep the viewer interested throughout.

However, if you're a fan of this genre, (you like good, though maybe mindless action), there's a chance ""Mercury Rising"" will do, as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece. liked it so much. But anyone would have to agree that Miko Hughes, who portrayed the autistic 9yr old ""Simon"", gave a performance just as touching and realistic as the young boy from The Sixth Sense. Mercury Rising had good action, good dialogue and good emotion. And Bruce Willis gave that certain touch to make it a 10 to me. fault of the designers, it's your fault.  Researchers who have discovered flaws in codes, watermarks, etc, have been arrested.  This ""head in the sand"" policy has been around for a long time.  So, next time you see this movie, just think how easy it would be to combine this attitude with someone a bit too gung ho. but is a damn fine actor), Willis really does add vulnerability to a role that he has played many times before, with the movie underpinned fantastically with a John Barry soundscore and Harold Becker carefully crafts what for me was a very enjoyable movie watching experience and stands head and shoulders above many I have seen recently. 3/5 for me of the movie is OK if you ignore that problem. The performances are generally good, and Miko Hughes is excellent as Simon. There is nothing here you haven't seen a dozen times before, but it's generally well done. It's not worth making any real effort to see this movie, but you probably won't have a bad time if you do. "	6.1	0
Spanish Prisoner, The (1997)	yet another film that justifies his reputation in my mind.Overall this is a great film that will engage you and entertain you with it's twisty and enjoyable plot.  It may lack the fireworks or heavy slick style of other films of the genre but it is all the better for it. Criminally under seen and deserves to be discovered. we've caught it, and then stops: it provides a perfect thumb-nail sketch of the film as a whole.  Also like the film as a whole, it's simply fun. Unlike so many directors Mamet doesn't act as if he's working in a disreputable genre, in which it's somehow bad form to allow the audience to have too good a time. kind of movie you have to see at least twice for full benefit.  It is not a great film, but a worthy one.Beside Steve martin in his serious role, which he pulls off very well, the film also has Ben Gazzara and Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon who is very good in one of the key roles in this film. Rebecca Pidgeon, Felicity Huffman, Ben Gazzara and Ricky Jay.  Each of them bring a special character to each performance.Fourth:  Movies like this, that don't feed you every morsel of the plot expectation in the first 15 minutes are a welcome breath of fresh air every time they are released.Congratulations on a most memorable movie to Mamet and company. but I think the audience is easily tricked into finding it brilliant. Maybe someone can explain why Martin's character is so easily found in the car showroom. Did I miss something there? And what if Campbell Scott's person had actually tried to deliver the tennis book directly to Martin's sister. That would have been the end of the story, period. 	7.3	0
City of Angels (1998)	"Just beleive the unbeleivable. Just go with the plot, and follow the movie closely.I'm not suggesting that City Of Angels is the best in it's sort.

The screenplay is pretty good, but somewhat lacking, which is why I give it an 8.25 on a scale from 1-10. Its a love story, yes, and can get cheesy at points, but none the less, it's still worth seeing once or twice. of Kleenex on hand...it's definitely a tearjerker. The ending of the movie is a testament to the power of love and life...powerful stuff. This is definitely a ""chick flick"", but is just wonderful on all levels. I have always believed in angels, but after seeing this film it gave me a different perspective of our guardian angels. A must see! with the characters. I really can't understand the harsh notes of critics and there sharp views but I can feel that this movie is worth falling for, even if you have to loose your eternity.This is my first comment on this site but I feel may be I delayed it only to give my first one to this one only.(24-12-05) film succeeds, and I believe it does, it is precisely because of the mixture of Hollywood gloss and original Wenders magic.  Something for everyone, if only you give it a little thought.Touching date movie, nice discussion piece, and filled with attractive people, City of Angels is wonderfully shallow and surprisingly deep at times, making it well worth the watch.

Last Days of Disco, The (1998)	"thought that a film showing it dying may be interesting and it did not disappoint me. If you are looking for a plot, this film doesn't have it. Not all of it worked and I was scratching my head a few times, but I think this film may become more enjoyable with a second viewing. I gave it a 7. only without dumb Joey and flaky Phoebe.Although, aesthetically and visually Whitman's film doesn't quite ring true  clothing looks too 90s and they'd never be able to talk so much in a club  the dialogue is fresh and chances are you'll be grinning from here to Bolivia when the ""Love Train"" rolls through the subway at the end.Ben Walsh of Disco"" is mostly a series of conversions. But the conversions are wonderful. Whit Stillman's dialogue is a delight; he nails what its like during those first years of adulthood when the life of the group is replaced by a mature individuality.  The ensemble cast is wonderful to watch, not overplaying their characters. I recommend this movie very highly that I've ever seen...everything from her line release to her body language stuck out; she became Alice.This film is a definite must see...a great soundtrack, great sets, brilliant writing and better acting. It's a bit long, some scenes feel unnecessary, and at times he seems to be over-hammering his point, but Stillman has still provided us with a near-masterpiece, 8/1. others (Metropolitan and Barcelona) than like anything you've seen about disco - which is simply the background. I was surprised that these yuppie characters were so freely admitted to Studio 54 (the set of the film), but perhaps it indicates disco's waning popularity by the early 1980s. I enjoyed it very much - but it's not everyone's cup of tea. "	6.7	0
Odd Couple II, The (1998)	"one-liners, most of which show just how much both men are seething. I think that my favorite scene is when they stop out in the middle of the desert, and...well, you have to see it. Somewhere up in that great retirement home in the sky, Oscar and Felix must still be getting on each other's nerves. They were truly great. I like especially the part with the ride they had with another old guy. That was classic. Oh, those two, they might've been old but the jokes and humor in their films were fresh. Recommended to all fans of the two, thank Walter Matthau, thank you Jack Lemmon, I'll never forget you, you two are funniest duo on the movies. two characters are familiar to us, and they are supposed to get to the wedding. Still the two stars give it their all, and with Baranski, Smart, and the late Bernard Hughes it works well enough as an entertainment. But for me, the wackiness and variety of OUT TO SEA make that film a better final film for the pair. when I almost had a brief flash back of when I saw the movie ""Ishtar"". The only thing worth seeing and is why I watched it is for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Despite this odd sequel having a crapola premise, you still gotta love these guys. I'd say watch it for them, but also check out the first movie. teams and as individual actors, so when Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster appear together for the last time, you want for them to have something really special. That is what we wanted for Jack Lemmon and Walther Matthau. These films are okay, but only because the actors are in them. They are not good enough movies to honor their memories. "	6.4	0
My Giant (1998)	"is a dramatic movie, which it wasn't marketed as, so I think that might be why a lot of people are disappointed. It's not a really deep story and the acting isn't great (Muresan is a basketball player and Billy Crystal is pretty much just going through the motions) but it's definitely worth seeing and is a good little movie. entertaining family movie.  Don't expect a deep thought provoker, or a hysterical side splitter, but just watch it.  I believe someone else described it as ""predictable fluff"", which is true but that doesn't have to be a bad thing all the time.  It's a nice movie so don't end up hating it because you expected too much. the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant, which is family and spouse love.and the comedy, it's just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows.and i must admit, it made me tear a little. change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. she would turn out to be a giant herself and that there would be a twist at the end but that was not to be.  George Muresan was a little difficult to understand but he brought a warmth to the role. I really enjoyed this heartwarming film and Billy Crystal always makes me laugh.

But the essential storylines work and play true: you believe in a conflict between father and son and you root for a high school basketball player who requires the wisdom of an adult to avoid the flesh peddlers. Kudos to Spike for not trying to hit us over the had with his message, but letting it unravel naturally. much to say about the intersections of patriarchy/economic injustice/racism that I wish Spike Lee could have been a little more consistent with his development of the women characters (one notable exception is a brilliantly realized performance by Milla Javovich as a prostitute that rooms next to Jake). This said the film is still an important accomplishment and should be seen. like what usually constitutes a basketball movie. Instead, the two main characters go through much self-analysis and introspective maturing, something that is quite rare for sports-playing men in film to do. I liked the strong use of color and the well-framed shots, and especially enjoyed Denzel Washington's brooding performance. A classic, must-see movie for anyone interested in cinematography or film. was how he put it, ""the truth."" This movie proves that in real life, you can benefit more by forgiving, and not forgetting.Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a unique, intellectual film that will make you think about your present situation, as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come with fame.

Illtown (1996)	storytelling, this film starts with vagueness and confusion but gradually gels into a coherent story. The problem is that it falls apart again in the last third, and we are never sure what really happened to the characters at the end. Still, the film is eminently watchable, and if you can handle the irresolution, I would recommend it for rental. of characters as the protagonists, the antagonist ends up in many ways as sympathetic, if not more, for this is a film that doesn't fill us in on the backstory for some time...watch it for Corrigan's great monologue about his wife three quarters of the way in, just one of many great moments in this truly weird, violent, unsettling film... this city? Why doesn't Gabriel look anything short of an chiseled underwear model after getting beat with a pool cue and strangled (not a damn mark on him after loosing teeth and turning purple)? What the HELL is the deal with Isaac Hayes? And DOES DANTE DIE? Is the abiguity suppossed to impress me? It just comes off as stupid. and the final shootout was awesome.I love Lili Taylor in anything, and she's great here. Also worth noting are the performances of a couple of highly underrated actors....Paul Schulze and Adam Trese. Watching Tony Danza play a gay crimelord is a hoot.Sure, it's downbeat, gritty, and dreary, but isn't that what gangsters and drug trafficking is all about? Love it! problem with the film is the pacing. All of the heroin-induced deadpan dialogue just wears the momentum out of the story. The talent here is just wasted in a cloudy disembodied attempt at a realistic portrayal of the world of heroin in Miami. My advice, stick with Gomez's earlier films and hope for future success from this very talented director. 	5.2	0
Slappy and the Stinkers (1998)	"to have compassion and sympathy for others, and a desire to do the right thing. Soon Slappy becomes an integral part of their group and the movie depicts their adventures (imagine how hard it is to keep a seal from being discovered by your parents for example). Predictable, yes......a little thin plot-wise, yes, but sweet and lighthearted just the same. a delightful and funny seal, being hidden (and disguised) by a group of youngsters, trying to protect him from those who would do him harm. A strict and unfeeling school master, along with gardener (Branson Pinchot) add to the enjoyment. Watch as once again good triumphs over evil! Clean, wholesome and upbeat comedy, a good addition to one's video library. actors in that movie were B.D. Wong and Scarlett Pommers. jokes and so on, then this is the movie for you! The script is packed jokes and situation comedy. I was apprehensive about watching it but I'm glad I did. Overall, I think this is worth a watch when you have over watched Up, Cars, How to train your Dragon and so on. PS, the dog deserves his own movie. as a team. Move over, Li'l Rascals. There's a new group of youngsters in Cute City. Why these kids didn't get a series (Hello! ""Slappy & the Stinkers: the Weekly Show"") or at least a few MacDonald's ads is beyond me. Whatever. Sometimes I don't know what goes on in Hollywood to let talent like this slide. See this movie! "	5.0	0
Zero Effect (1998)	"again) and Kim Dickens are also terrific.There are so many great lines in the film, particularly those where Daryl is explaining his methods of deduction and surveillance. His explanation of the best way to follow someone is priceless, as is his explanation on how to find things !This film is a pure joy and very refreshing. Go see it ! is interesting too as his loyalties are tested throughout the film. At first it is difficult to determine how astute Daryl is--is he really the ""most observant"" person in the world? Or is he a bumbling fake? As the story develops, you see how adept Daryl Zero is. Even the soundtrack is good with a great song by Nick Cave. movie that featured some really good performances.  Stiller and O'Neal are solid, but the always-likeable Bill Pullman is the real standout here.  There are lots of great moments in this film, many of them comedic, and except for an occasionally slow pace during the second half, I was greatly entertained throughout.  Definitely worth checking out this movie. world', Daryl Zero. He certainly suited the part in Zero Effect!Ben Stiller, Ryan O'Neal and Kim Dickens all provide great support in this different but interesting comedy. It had a very good story, some interesting social commentary and observation. Not quite a thriller but for its acute observation, realistic characters and storyline, Ill give this a ***1/2 out of *****!!! was a fantastic movie. I'm not always a big fan of Pullman, but he was excellent in the role. If you are considering not watching this movie because you don't like Ben Stiller, well don't let that stop you. He takes his normal persona down a couple notches. Don't expect to see any traces of Zoolander or Meet the Parents. "	7.0	0

It's not necessarily something you'd watch repeatedly (unless you've a shade of masochism to you), but it is something that will leave a little indelible mark on you as something to muse on. Definitely worth seeing - but be prepared. 8.1/10. job. Of course a film of this type is not going to win any Oscars - Oldman didn't make it to please anyone. Most will find this nihilistic and depressing, and they're right. Suffice to say, Oldman is a natural craftsman. If he continues to follow his heart and gut, who knows what else he might accomplish. A remarkable debut. within the frame. The result is an incendiary experience, a film that leaves you gasping for fresh air and in awe of the superb performances, sharp cutting, great sound design and unapologetic subject matter. It doesn't angle for simple solutions to its powerhouse issues and isn't all misery, either. It's about strength and the the power of personal responsibility. Superb. through these things. Its a reality show in which the people don't know they're being watched. This film is a tough journey to take, as its very painful and emotional, but it is ultimately rewarding to sit through it and reach the conclusion.Very highly recommended, but be warned, this movie pulls no punches and shows you life as it is. has also realised that in terms of direction, ""gritty"" does not have to mean the static, cold and quite frankly boring as hell style that so many British films have. The camera moves with a documentary feel energy, yet the slick cinematography keeps it from ever looking cheap. Quite simply one of the greatest British films of all time. 9/10 "	7.4	0

Only the superb acting of James Mason as the villainous Black Knight made that older version interesting. The fight scenes in this Prince Valiant were well executed. Kudos to the arms master for the handsome suits of armor and weapons. The actress who portrayed Princess Ilene is stunning. literally. ""Prince Valiant"" is billed as a British/Irish/German co-production, which only goes to show that there is at least one field, the tenth-rate fantasy epic, in which the European film industry can hold its own against American competition. I can only assume that the film's European origins were the reason that it was overlooked for a well-deserved Razzie nomination. 2/10 happens over and over again.The film editing is bad enough that it makes it hard to follow the story at spots. And the stunts and special effects kept blowing up the suspension of disbelief.There is plenty of no-brainer action, though, and high production values on the sets and costumes.  This could have been fun if it was better made. very well done and give the movie a really nice flair. The only bad performance that I could spot was the real short appearance by the rather silly (but famous) supermodel Markus Schenkenberg. But that couldn't mar this otherwise really good movie, its only flaw is that it is somehow too fast paced sometimes, otherwise I can only recommend it. "	5.1	0

Iin the film she is a singer and she does a few numbers because she is auditioning.I was absolutely BLOWN away by her voice and by the beautiful songs she sang.  If for this reason only, watch!  A real treat! great music. heartfelt emotion. Yes, a lot of what this girl says and does contradicts itself-but that's life and that's what makes this film realistic. This film has an independent feel and is not ""Hollywood"" at all. The ending is a little pat, but I forgive it that. I anxiously await Ms. Davis next movie! If you see this on cable, watch!!!!!!!!!!!! neurotic than usual. But if it does sound like your thing, stick with this one, it gets better as it goes along.Katie (Marla Schaffel) is 25 and conflicted, to say the least, about her desire to terminate her virginity.

It's a simple story, endearingly told and well directed.  Sean Tatyran and Chris Bradley are excellent.

No black and white characters, but people who make mistakes sometimes. Along with the good acting of Denis Leary and good-old Terence Stamp it makes up of one fairly good movie. At least, it was a lot better than the over sentimental Indecent Proposal. of time. The characters weren't believable. Stamp behaved like a zombie. I didn't see him smile during the entire movie. He was gaga over the female lead, who I thought was nothing in particular, and her singing left me cold. And the annoying parallel story - wow!  Don't watch it. I give it a 1, and I'm being generous. was...but then it got terrible and predictable. Even the flashbacks were awful and had little or no meaning.The only good part was Dennis Leary got to play himself. He was kinda funny but then end was just a waste of film.Avoid at all costs.

Looking at the film, I can't imagine that it was changed too radically in the editing, except  perhaps the ultra-acidic put-downs on the title cards that introduce new characters. corrupted by the studio. He wants to remove his name from the movie, but since Alan Smithee is the pseudonym used for directors who want to remove their name from a picture, he is out of luck and becomes... unbalanced. Very dry, but very amusing. If you liked Last Action Hero and Purple Rose of Cairo, you'll probably like this. see why people can praise films like ""Memento"" (which told a story in an unconventional way, just like ""Burn""), or ""Spinal Tap"" (which has no real plot, just like ""Burn""), and not give this movie, and at least average review. If you can find it, watch it and decide for yourself, don't take the word of these flakers and perpetrators. in interviews, and with the trailer for the blockbuster. It wants to be a mockumentary.

The humor is for adults, so if you're looking for big belly-laughs and gross-out situations, you'll be disappointed.

It's a satisfying action film for enthusiast of the genre and specially for Jackie fans . his movie is a strange combination: quite possibly the thinnest plot and worst acting of any Jackie Chan movie... and some of the best and funniest fight scenes, as well.Fortunately the movie moves along briskly and there's never much time between humor and fight scenes for you to dwell on just how bad the acting was in the preceeding scene. and involves Chan commandeering a large earth moving vehicle and wreaking havoc with it. When I say large, I mean LARGE. The tires alone must be 12 feet tall in and of themselves. It's pretty cool to see the devastation this vehicle incurs. A fun film. Had the plot itself been a bit more thickened my rating would've been higher. 	6.2	0
Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e guilass) (1997)	"movie about suicide-it's about the choice we have in life, to end it whenever we want. We have a door we can open at any time, but we choose to stay ... The movie is about the possibility of living, and how we have the choice to live. Life isn't forced on us. That's the main theme of the movie."" film for somebody expecting action or a typical Western film, but rather, this would be a film that I would recommend only to those who are in the mood for an insightful, philosophical film that shows an alternative view of life. Overall, it was an emotionally powerful film that will stick out in my memory as all Kiarostami films do. The film's unusualvisual style, particularly the long unedited takes, works surprisinglywell for this type of story.  I can understand why traditionalAmerican filmgoers would be bored to tears by A TASTE OFCHERRY, but for fans of independent and foreign film, it's aworthwhile investment of your time.  It probably works better withan older audience that can identify with the world-wearycharacters. to us & let us think for ourselves.Every scene is simple & ordinary, but has a certain strange fascination. I have seen ""Through The Olive Trees"" before (also directed by Abbas). To be honest, I don't like it, although it's said to be a good film. But this one is different. ""Go see it"" is what I want to say. other film industries have. For what the Iranian film industry has at its disposal, this film is an exceptional achievement! This film is a great example of how the expression of human beings' feelings and ideas cannot be held back by censorship. Kudos to Kiarostami for creating a very heartfelt commentary on the effects of oppression on the human soul. "	7.7	1
Character (Karakter) (1997)	expecting that each viewing will bring a closer understanding. Even the evil Dreverhaven was more an object of pity rather than despicable; his actions were caused more by ignorance of human sensitivities, a dogmatic respect for the law and an unusual philosophy rather than by malice. The film is open-ended. What will Jacob do with the rest of his life? something else; an audience which was only very slowly won by the tense and restrained 'northern', 'iceberg' pace of the film, 'Character' transformed the screen into a gigantic and painful mirror filled with reflections of the sorrows and sufferings of human nature. And finally those teenagers stopped crunching chips and sipping sodas, and started thinking. A '10' by any standard. film unfolded. There is a desire to reach the end, but no hurry.For sure, this film wouldn't interest everyone, but I rank it among my favorite films.  It deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Picture last year: for the story, for the performances, for the direction ... it's rare that one finds a movie so well-put together. are terrific. One more thing, the art design is beautiful; the image the film gives us of the 1930's Amsterdam is very powerful and very beautiful.Not only is it a great film then, but it is a story that carries a lot of feelings, and will take you on quiet an emotional ride. I can only say this: enjoy it! as the magnificent locations.This films really told a story, reflects well its age and overall has a well developed timing so you'll never lose interest in what is next, and has so many twists that your interest never decays. But I really liked the final one. This one only scene pays all the money and time you spent seeing it.OUTSTANDING!! 	7.8	1
Junk Mail (Budbringeren) (1997)	"a little (or a lot) more than he bargained for! Some of the world's most interesting movies have come from Scandinavia (e.g., anything by Ingmar Bergman). ""Budbringeren"" (called ""Junk Mail"" in English) is no exception. This look at some of Norway's grittier aspects is truly eye-opening. Maybe it's not any kind of masterpiece, but it's still an interesting slice-of-life tale. anti-hero remains a complete enigma throughout, but funnily enough, despite my reservations at the beginning, it was rather hard not to be won over at the end of the day. There were some marvellously taut action and suspense sequences, and some hilariously humourous scenes. Rather similar to most Scandinavian films I've seen actually. Dark grey and depressing, but blackly comic. after she tries to commit suicide. For this guy, this uncharacteristically unselfish act sets off a disastrous chain of events. This weird movie will NOT work for you if you don't think it's funny. And this movie will only be funny for you to the degree that you're cynical and capricious in your affections. People of good heart, stay away. give any more away would definitely ruin your enjoyment so I'll stop there. Suffice to say that things get a little more complicated. This quirky little Norwegian film didn't get a whole lot of attention on its US release. Too bad... it's well-written and well-acted and definitely worth checking out. Sort of a kinder and gentler version of ""Blue Velvet"". illusion of effortlessness that is in fact very hard to achieve.  Despite being a film of great moral complexity, Junk Mail wears its serious purpose very lightly, and is in fact very funny indeed.Certainly one of the best films to come out of Scandinavia in recent years, and one which shows a side of Oslo few outsiders ever witness.

Species II (1998)	"has nothing to do except sit around in a glass cage. Madsen just needs to run around armed and look cool - he understandably gives a lackluster performance.

Michael Marsden may be the bright spot in this average sci-fi flick. I wouldn't pay to see this in the theatre, but on video.... There are probably worse ways to spend an hour and forty-two minutes. the central story line. Overall, a movie with no artistic pretensions and, undoubtedly, many flaws (someone else already mentioned this; why didn't her head explode when she escaped from the lab?), but watch it in the right frame of mind and it's quite enjoyable. Do you know any other movie that features sex between slimy aliens?!?    (**1/2) this sequel is not.  Bad acting, strained and disjointed, and not much for effects, except for the final several minutes where he and she mutate and do their thing.  I'll put up with quite a bit in the interest of sci-fi, but this blows.  I'm trying to think of something equally as bad, perhaps those Cyborg movies. have a new interview with Natasha Henstridge, which gives us a bit of a rundown on her career and how she transitioned from modeling to ""Species"". Oh, and don't forget new interviews with the effects crew. Whether you think this is a good movie or not, these interviews are valuable and really put 1990s horror and science fiction in context.

Major League: Back to the Minors (1998)	"League' movie!""  I got the feeling the characters from the previous two movies were just tacked onto the existing story line.

And the young phenom hitter.Not Bull Durham, but could have been good. one, because, well, that one's just very bad: worse than drinking Jobu's rum. (Although the look on Berenger's face in the second one when he has to say ""okay, Rick, let's get nasty"" is priceless, I have to admit).

I can see why this film was a flop at the box-office. Larry David is an acquired taste and better suited to a niche audience on cable. But if you like anything else he's done, you shouldn't miss this overlooked little beauty. very fun to watch here. You can tell they must have had fun making the movie, because they work together very well.Like I said, very Seinfeld-ish. Now that you know Larry David wrote it, you'll notice even more Larry David elements within the movie. They're everywhere when you consider the structure of the plot, the amplified & quirky characters etc... in turn. Eventually when it's all over, something ultimately terrible happens. Suspense is not only something that relates to a horror film, in my opinion...upon seeing this film. The director perfected it to an almost migraine inducing level. If you are patient, this movie is fantastic. If you're not, and you simply can't stand it...well perhaps this isn't for you. which was co-created and written by Larry David.  There are conversations about hotel sex and Craig Beirko reminded me of George with his constantly reminding everyone that a doctor didn't hold a door for him.

Have fun! 10/10 maybe not (the film does show him in Europe as being far more celebrity-like than here). In all, it works best as an objective view of the subject matter, of a director who also happens to be a good musician who enjoys playing what he calls ""crude...esoteric music"" of old.

Big Hit, The (1998)	"a feel good movie '90s style where the under dog anti-hero gets the good he deserves in the end. The riot is seeing all the other materialistic people around Melvin all trying to take advantage of him showing how nice of a guy he is despite his choice of profession.Was this movie great ? Yes !! And is highly recommended. fun. I'm surprised this movie is so little known, and I am even more surprised that so many people hate it. Sure, if you expect a serious, realistic action movie, The Big Hit isn't the movie for you. You really need a sense of humour for this. Expect an action comedy, almost a parody, and you'll be entertained for sure. It's just good fun and Lou Diamond Phillips is brilliant. His over-the-top performance is perfect and is something I'll never forget.The Big Hit is one of those films where you either get it or you don't. If you don't then I can understand how it might seem a bit two-dimensional. However, anyone who hasn't seen it should take a chance. the movie is silly and corny - but that was the intent of the film.Its more than understandable that this movie isn't for everybody, either you love it or hate it.  However, if you watched the movie and took it seriously (ie the breakdancing during the first 'hit'), then you definitely missed the point.  8 out of 10. humor. To like this one, you can't take life too seriously. If you've ever seen ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", this has similar humor, but it's like ""L, S and TSB"" on Prozac.

I would very much like to see the story continued by this team of creators and actors. capturing the flavor of Burroughs' later Tarzan novels than anything else I have seen.

Black Dog (1998)	"and Road House are my top 3 personal favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! This movie get's 10 out 10 for Patrick Swayze's best underrated action movie he ever did, alongside with Road House! But Road House for me will be his best action classic martial arts film a film of my childhood that I will always cherish it. actors aren't simply laughing their way through but rather they treated this like a serious work.  The actress who plays Swayze's wife has a style which usually annoys me but she, too, was ok in this thing. Even the little bits of country music didn't bother me.  A stupid finale? Sure, but even that was fun.  Wow. ""Superman IV"" and the Studio execs slashed his budget in half...this time however at pretty much the last minute, before scene shooting got started. But Blackdog is entertaining and fun,the cast is a great cast. Heck with a good beer it gets even better. But please if you must drink, stay at home and be nice to those around you. at the movie cover, Crews encounters hordes of inept henchmen along the way. Fortunately for Jack Crews, their vehicles explode easily. Still, Crews n' Company face many action-packed twist and turns on their journey. Swayze gives a spectacular performance; deserving of the either an academy award or employee of the month.

Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 (1998)	would have never had, had i stayed there. This was a great movie, one i would recommend to anyone looking for a good way to spend an evening. not only does it show that a movie can be good without being raunchy and filled with sex, its worth the time that you spend watching it. I would watch it again. town that we grew up in.  It is fascinating to watch these teenagers begin to grow into men -- at an accelerated pace, because of their childhood pledge.Someday, when you are at the video store and you don't know what to get, you will see this on the shelf.  Get it.  You will be very, very happy. a window back in time to the life we used to be able to live.

It's boring - to some!I offer no judgment, just this filter to help you decide whether the movie's for you.  If you like movies that make you ache for small-town life, you'll like this.

Go Now (1995)	"should not deter one from seeing it. Anyone who has MS or knows someone who has MS or any other kind of debilitating condition should see this film. You might learn something from it.

Everything is amazingly real, even the long sex scene at the beginning of the love affair that will eventually turn into an everlasting love story. Of course I do highly recommend this movie. more work and the other actors aren't as strong as Carlyle, Go Now is still worth a viewing just for his performance alone.  It leaves you with the impression that the film really was made just to be a showcase for his work.  Occasional comic relief from his buddies provided a witty twist, and the soundtrack was top-notch. has ever been filmed!No ,there's no sex in it!Nick's girlfriend ,Karen does not want to go now,and she stands in the pouring rain,she keeps waiting waiting desperately waiting.She gave the highest proof of her love that she could.It's not a desperate film.The last scene is a message of hope. As Bessie Banks sings ""Go now....or you'll see me cry "" and horror. Plenty of sex and raucous scenes make for a stunningly real and unconventional film. But it´s Robert Carlyle´s astonishing performance that deserves attention. Not really that much to learn here about the disease itself, but the film is touching and realistic, a far cry from similar-themed Hollywood products.

Look into it. stay put, forever locked in dead-end jobs.  At the film's end, Iris realizes that improving her situation can come only from `never hiding, never sitting silently, and never just waiting -- and waiting -- and watching the world go by.'  Clockwatchers may be a `small' film with a soft voice, but at least it has something to say. our worth to others or our self-worth? What is loyalty and betrayal, to whom do you owe how much, and how do you give consent to those obligations/ownership? Work/friends/family are all portrayed as villains and allies wielding this loyalty Sword of Damocles.One IMDB reviewer said this film was a good way to kill time after work. That's terrific irony. :)     Suffice it to say, Clockwatchers covers a lot of ground, but the layers are folded well together in a way that makes you care about what happens to these characters and their station in life. A must-see sleeper for those who prefer (for example) Merchant & Ivory over Van Damme & Seagal. 9 out of 10. this is a satire.  Exaggeration is key to satire.Go rent this movie.

There are precisely three movies I have seen that caused the room to get dusty around me (if you get my drift), and this is one of them.In conclusion: See this movie. Keep an open mind while watching this movie: don't watch it with the misconception that it's just going to be another one of those big-budget dull blockbuster films that gets churned out every summer. This one dares to avoid the seemingly standard clichés set by other films of the genre, which makes it a truly unique film to experience.Score: 9/10 that it gives a very human side to tragedy and devastation by showing how ordinary people cope in times of crisis but it avoids the trap of being trite and overly-sentimental. It's a shame the film is so underrated then as it is a film that would appeal to sci-fi fans and those seeking an interesting story with strong characters. eyes at the many plot contrivances the way the others I listed did. The only major flaw for me was the casting of tea Leoni. The usually dependable actress was extremely bland in this film. She has done much better work in her career. Despite that flaw this is another fine movie that for some reason is really under rated. was no cheerful hugging in the end with lame Aerosmith playing over it. The only thing that bothered me was that all of the nuclear missiles from the US and Russia had no effect on the comet.

Little Men (1998)	book. But after time I decided to give it a try again and ignored the book (kind of like what you have to do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the series wonderful! It was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going. It is truly enjoyable! Clean and wonderful! enjoy. It may not be the exact copy of the novel, but I like what the writers, producers, and directors have done with the storyline and characters. Each actor in this show has so much talent and brings to life such a great story, one that I love dearly and am sure that many others will. I love Little Men! so I guess I'll tell you a bit more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone gives it a shot. I recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy, but it's good heart. Like I said before, it's refreshing. everyone in the family can enjoy and feel good about watching.  Little Men is one of the cleanest shows, and while some connect clean with boring, Little Men is nothing near boring.  Even my parents and older brothers and sisters like to watch the show.  The show is romantic, emotional, wholesome (for the most part), and adventurous. good for your whole family to watch. There is Romance, Adventure, and Excitement in every episode. It truly is a one of a kind show! 	7.3	0

My mind is so clouded with how bad this was.  You'd think Will Smith could get his wife a decent part with how powerful he's become in Hollywood. will probably cause offence to black people and white liberals and will certainly irritate everyone else , so from having a movie that from the outset would merely have been very run of the mill we have a movie that is embarrassing .

The performances are uniformly good for the film's intent, but Sarah Polley stands out as doing something beyond what's merely required. 8/10 notice before. That, to me, is a film worth seeing! When we showed this at our local film society, it got a great reception, one of the best we ever had for a film.  The Hanging garden is short, bittersweet and - sadly - true to life.

Lawn Dogs (1997)	"films of the 90's. If you like off-beat slices of America with a twisted view, then ""Lawn Dogs"" is the best movie you'll see in a long time. It is quite simply full of the magic, menace and imagination alive in the heads and hearts of little girls...about to become young women. Oh yeah, and give Sam Rockwell his due! and the lesser spotted Bruce McGill in one of his best roles as security guard Nash. The music is also peerless, at first playful and calm, building to a dramatic climax.That climax is what makes this film stand head and shoulders above the rest. An emotional pay-off such as you have never seen in a film of this ilk. 9/10 girl's interest.Of course the potential for misunderstanding in this kind of relationship is great and it inevitably happens. I feared that the movie was about to fly apart after Devon's father and some others confronted Trent, but the fantastic ending (fantastic in the sense of fantasy) made me smile. If you are looking for something different, this movie definitely qualifies. worrying as it appears to veer off at a tangent, but the final sentiment is beautifully presented and encouraging (albeit due to a child's apparent naivety).Overall this is a lovely film that I'm very glad I watched.  About more than just an adult/child friendship, this film is moving and involving in both it's core plot and it's wider themes. fantasy that is more European than American (or Australian) in its view world both morally and visually. The climax is an unexpected treat and its moral resolution arrives just in the nick of time.Sumptuously photographed and written with great intelligence by Naomi Wallace, it dares to be erotic, provoking, unconventional and incisive.Don't pass it up if you get an offer.

I also love song ""The Prayer"" too. The song became popular among artists like the Celtic Woman - I don't understand why a popular song would come from a film that people thought it's awful. Stone also worked a lot better while being in a similar vein.If you want an American animated movie that is really consistent with its own world, animated well, has good characters, etc. check out the Secret of Nimh. You can get it really cheap on DVD now. Seeing Quest for Camelot the day after Nimh, there really is no comparison... characters are very weak except Garrett's character 8/Visual Effects are awful 9/Over 350 animators have worked to create this animation, but it's still not ""animating"" what needs to be animated, 'cause the action sequences and the human movements/reflexes are dreadful 10/Sound Effects are not synchronized properly Give it a shot, this is at least worth watching, catch it on Youtube.

Godzilla (1998)	I agree that there is a slight clunkiness in parts of the narrative flow--it caused me to subtract a point), there's no way it deserves the trashing it's received so far. This is at least a well-made film on a technical level, and if you have any taste for slightly campy sci-fi/monster flicks, you should find much to enjoy here. fun performances and excellent CGI. Godzilla, yet classified as a horror\suspense, was actually a touching film and was sad in some parts, as well. I will never understand how someone could hate a film that's just meant to be all around fun and enjoyment. It is still my favorite out of the original and newest remake.Two thumbs up for Godzilla. story and other problems.Personally, I don't care.  The movie, from day one was meant to be just a big effects laden action movie.  It's just for fun.  I understood the story. The movie should just be viewed as a fun, blow everything up in your way movie.  Don't be so hard.  Sit back and enjoy. Shakespeare...it's Godzilla.  You have to appreciate the work that went into making this creature look so lifelike. This movie had spectacular special effects and a pretty decent story line. I thought this movie was great.  I didn't find the acting to be all that bad.  I would recommend watching this movie before you come to any conclusions. problem is. This was supposed to be a fun, exciting, and action packed thrill ride. That's all it is, no more, no less. I personally think that it succeeds at what it achieved to be perfectly. Matthew Broderick may not exactly be an action hero, but his character sure was quirky and funny. Jean Reno was as good as usual. 	5.3	0
Bulworth (1998)	"not a film to be taken for granted or forgotten. It's a quintessential example of a 'contemporary classic' for our generation. I have no doubt that over the next decade or so, people will want to revisit it and examine the politics and the cultures; it should be studied in classrooms, it should be valued. I loved Bulworth!My rating: 9/10 going to have to take a cold hard look at who we really are and what is really happening around us. Accepting other people particularly from different racial and economic backgrounds has to be more than just an insincere speech act. It must be an act of good will that is grounded in practical reality.Overall rating: 8 out of 10. of the box, stream of consciousness conviction of a world gone mad.This is probably too pretentious and pandering for anyone but the far left to tolerate. However, even years later it is timeless, and you cannot deny that it is a mind-numbing movie that is entertaining and one must wonder, just how they made it happen. But here it is. an actor or producer or director. From ""Mickey One"" to ""Reds"" passing through ""Bonnie And Clyde"" and ""Shampoo"" not to mention ""Heaven Can Wait"" Mr. Beatty's legacy is one of amazing consistency. As I smiled enjoying his funny portrayal in ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" with Vivien Leigh, I thought: that beautiful man is not just a pretty face. Beatty has made a film that walks the razor's edge right along with it's lead character, playing into deliberately provoking racial and cultural stereotypes at the same time it shreds them. This isn't a polite ""the system needs fixing"" movie, it's an in-your-face scream that the system is broken, perhaps beyond all repair. That idea seems only more timely now. "	6.8	0
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)	Drugs, drugs and more drugs, but instead of preaching their evils or telling you how fabulous life is when you're on acid, you get a very unbiased experienced approach to their use and abuse. Visually the film is amazing and both Johnny Depp and Benizio Del Toro are true to the book. I couldn't possibly recommend this film more highly. look he switch to 8 mm, then black and white, now it's slow mo all in 3 seconds!Anyway, I digress. This is a fine movie, don't watch it stoned, you'll get more out of it, repeated viewings are recommended. I also recommend getting the criterion DVD version, which has commentary by Gilliam, Depp, del Torro and Hunter S. Thompson himself! in those awful theatre seats. Heaven forbid we're required to use our imagination a little bit and not have it handed to us in the form of Hollywood mindless pap. The film, del toro, Depp, and of course, Gilliam are all brilliant. I pity the fools who gave this movie a negative review and fail miserably in articulating their reasoning. frenzy on Las Vegas.  This movie has everything a critic should be looking for in a masterpiece - magnificent cinematography, lovely acting, shock value, provocation of thought, and a meaning behind it all.  To freaks like me it also has immense entertainment value as well.  This work will be one of my favorite movies of all time. such a shame that this great film works like this as I'm sure there are many people who are unwilling to give it the second chance it deserves. If you haven't seen this film I suggest you do and if you don't like it see it again. If you have seen this film and didn't like it, see it again. 	7.7	1
Opposite of Sex, The (1998)	times. However Lisa Kudrow offers comic relief playing a straight square teacher who disapproves of everything and everyone in life especially sex. That is until she finds Sex on her doorstep. The Opposite of Sex is a brilliant film, when Christina Ricci was in her prime. It deserved much more praise than it got which is such as shame. 9/10 and witty.  I can see however, how one could be offended and turned off by it.  But the narration is not for shock effect but rather to frame the main character.I wouldn't change a frame or a line in this film.  It's funny, intelligent and warm in a strange sort of way.  A definite must see. If your into witty one liners, a fast story line and terrific acting (two thumbs up to Lisa Kudrow!)than this movie is for you. After a movie that makes you think about other peoples lifestyles and situations? give it a try. As an eighteen year old, I recommend this movie for older teens and up and give it a 8/10. Donovan and Kudrow make the movie; their characters were completely believable.  Last but certainly not least is the best young American actress, Christina Ricci.  She really makes every part she plays her own.  I suggest the Christian Youth or whoever they are stay away; everyone in this movie has too many human qualities for you to tolerate. have a trash-talking southerner: Christina Ricci (in one of her better roles) who takes some pretty illogical decisions in life and affects so many lives around her. Martin Donovan shines as her half-brother, seemingly very pacified and unnerved about things in life (a doormat personality, perhaps?). Watch out for Lisa Kudrow: she steals the show with her expressions and acting. 	6.5	0
I Got the Hook Up (1998)	"at the same time), the acting is pretty horrible (although Master P's vocabulary primarily consists of Uuuuuuuuugh anyway), and there's gratuitous shots of just about anything that doesn't help the continuity of the movie.  Next to ""Dolemite II: The Human Tornado"", this is probably the funniest movie that its only humor is derived from the horribleness of the movie. One would think that with the collaborative effort NO LIMIT uses to write and direct their movies they would produce at least one film with substantial length or original content. Sadly, this movie falls short on both stipulations.I hope Master P and the NO LIMIT crew had fun making this horrible movie because audience members won't have fun watching it. the previews.  A.J. Johnson says:  ""Here are the twins, Ug and Lee.""Just so I don't sound like a complete sour grape, there is one great scene involving a boatload of topless babes.  If you happen to catch this movie on cable, that scene is worth waiting for.  But don't waste any money to rent this movie. dialog and characters. At times, it almost feels like they cast hilarious people and just let them say whatever they wanted. The fact IMDb didn't have ANY ""memorable quotes"" listed for this movie tells me it is truly under-appreciated. I added several of my favorite lines in hopes that some of you guys might laugh and check out this film. is no real drama.  And it's a good thing, because this is a comedy.  Anthony Johnson(a.k.a.

If you are a fan of almost Simpsons-style ""random"" humor, this film is instantly funny. Never be turned off by the first glance of this film. If you dismiss it as ""poor comedy"" you will be missing out. How about the eagle scene or at the party. Or how about the bar scene or the dentist. At the start of the movie his is dragged on stage to be hung. Some people on this board probably don't like Chris Farley. Or maybe they don't like Matthew Perry. That however shouldn't mean they should hate every movie with them.9/10 laughs, often atthe absurd crudity of its humor.  There are scenes and dialoguethat come off as cheap attempts at lowbrow humor, when in factthe real punchline is that you, the viewer, even acknowleged thehumor when it is so utterly tasteless. I, for one, laughed my @$$off and got overdue fees at my video store because I couldn't stopwatching it. this movie from being perfect is just like with OLD SCHOOL, there are some attempts at humor in the movie that seem out of place in a movie like this. Sadly, this was Chris Farley's last movie. Nearly seven years after his death, it is still hard to believe he's gone. He was in my opinion, the funniest guy ever! and I was totally convinced that I was looking at the early 1800's.I watched it the first time and giggle a bit, I watched it the second time and laughed here and there, I watched it for the third time and laughed nearly all the way through!

It will leave you very satisfied that you took the time to see this very finely made and acted film. her husband and the struggles of Sandra's daughter and nephew, create many heartbreakingly touching moments and at last - an intriguing story with a sense of humor. Living in Texas and having visited a few small towns, I can state that the movie's portrayal of small town life is a very realistic one which only adds to the films' effectiveness. tell Justin how it is impresses me and empowers me. The music is some of the most beautiful music I've heard and it just makes this experience all the more perfect for me! I love it and recommend it to any woman who has ever been hurt and survived. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my opinion. watching HOPE FLOATS a real treat; I have never seen her more bold or more beautiful (even as a vamp in MISS CONGENIALITY) - she is absolutely gorgeous here.Manipulation and honesty mixed in an effective, emotional pressure-cooker, HOPE FLOATS may just make you sick like a roller-coaster. But for anyone interested in Sandra Bullock, it is required viewing . .. of the obvious comedy of big-city girl versus small-town country girl. And that's a good thing.The young daughter can get annoying, and the romantic comedy angle is transparent from the beginning. But the natural drama that Birdee goes through in trying to rebuild her life after a public divorce is done well enough that it makes ""Hope Floats"" worth watching. "	5.9	0
Insomnia (1997)	"Engstrom and the viewer will feel by the end of the picture.I have not seen the remake yet, and I'm not sure that I want to do so. The Hollywood movie business never seems to know when to leave well enough alone.  I'll be able to make a better recommendation when or if I get around to the remake. seen by Hollywood actors, especially in thrillers. 'Insomnia' is a fantastic movie that I cannot fault. The less you know about it the better. Whatever you do, SEE this movie! Highly recommended, especially for those sick and tired at how most thrillers made these days are so predictable and formulaic. It doesn't have to be so, and 'Insomnia' proves it! villages. Most of the action takes place in non-descript rooms, suffused with the cold grey light of the arctic sun. The acting is understated and viewers are left to understand motivations without explicit explanation. The film is engrossing from beginning to end, and I'll never understand why Hollywood feels it needs to try to do better - it rarely can. is reminiscent of most M. Knight Shymalan heroes; powerful, yet weary. Skjoldbjaergs's direction is absolutely beautiful. The colors are quite sharp, and most scenes are expertly framed  most would make gorgeous still frames.I plan to see the remake of 'Insomnia' eventually, but whether you have seen it or not, I would recommend catching the film that inspired it. 7/10.--Shelly from sleep deprivation while on assignment in Norway. Stylistically the director and cinematographer effectively recreate the alienated and somewhat hallucinatory feeling of being sleep deprived and in a foreign country. There's more to the story of course, but to reveal those details would spoil the surprises. Be warned, if you like your movie heroes uncomplicated then stay away from ""Insomnia"". "	7.3	0
Little Boy Blue (1997)	"many go to see Phillippe's body in cheaper, low-brow movies.  They will likely miss this one-- which surely shows more of Phillippe than any of his others-- but which for the first time shows the possibility of a coming actor.  And, in at least my opinion, finally puts Phillippe in a quality movie-- one you won't soon forget.Rating:8 see them together again as I had enjoyed them so much in ""Maria's Lovers"".  It was nice to see the chemistry still there.  Admittedly, some of the sex scenes are a bit harsh and you need to see this movie more than once to really understand it, but don't let that stop you from seeing it at all. problem with the film was that the early part of the film didn't deal with (or even allude to) the overriding premise that really comes to light in the final third of the film.  Additionally, the Doris Knight characterization seemed a bit unstable and her motivation in the final scenes is hard to pin down.Still, a highly recommended film. heart attack if she watched it. I recomend it, if you've got a strong stomach and a bit of patience. It's worth watching twice (kind of like The Sixth Sense, how the movie is in a new light on the second viewing), it'll have your wheels spinning. If anything can be said about it...it's unique, original and interesting...and certainly affecting. I thought I'd figured things out but was proved wrong. Had this been directed by someone like David Lynch it would probably have been a masterpiece. Nonetheless, even if it doesn't rise to that level it is certainly a film that holds your attention and keeps you guessing until the end. More than a ""B movie"" .. maybe a B+. "	6.4	0
Ugly, The (1997)	"with a different combination of drama, thriller and horror. The two nurses are nasty and the plot keeps the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Unfortunately the conclusion is disappointing and gives the sensation that something is missing to be a great film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""The Ugly- O Maníaco"" (""The Ugly – The Maniac"") me but gives a memorable performance, and really helps this work, as does the inventive editing and playing with narrative, which deftly mixes the past and present, fantasy and reality. The stylized touches such as the black blood also made 'The Ugly' fascinating viewing. I'm highly critical of most contemporary horror movies, but I highly recommend 'The Ugly'. Great stuff! films of Peter Weir like THE LAST WAVE or PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK.Like SE7EN before it, it disturbs and disorients you on some pretty deep levels, then gut-punches you with a shockingly unexpected ending, which may not make it something you want to see over and over again. But for fans of this particular genre, it's definitely worth a look. to end their movie interestingly.  It's not clever scripting but bad writing. Overall The Ugly is an okay horror movie.  It does have a fair bit of suspense and a couple of good shocks but nothing too noteworthy.  Prior to the ending The Ugly rated an 8 but as a whole rates a 5 out of 10. a bit unbelievable but this adds a 'Twin Peaks' feel to the film.  And as for the ending, some things are better left unexplained, people!!This movie is very violent and creepy, and guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.  If you like it, tell all your friends about it!  I give it a 8.5/10 "	6.2	0
Beyond Silence (Jenseits der Stille) (1996)	"cinema and then it was nominated for the golden globe. Its a wonderful film. You can love,hate,dream,cry and laugh. The protagonists are all very believeable. Mrs.Link doesn t need any special effects or optical drumbaborium to tell her story. One newspaper wrote,as good as candle-light,and thats the perfect description of the film. And I want to add,as soft as snow-flakes. perfect ending, in which everything that really matters, works out. The idea of the movie and the very story has, as I have mentioned, a very deep and original plot, but this movies has more to it than this. Great acting (especially from the father), great music and is overall greatly directed and written. Good movie with many details. 7/10 help getting emotional as the story went on. For those who live or work with deaf or hard-of-hearing people, this is a must see; for those who don't, you should definitely see it as well and cherish your good sense of hearing -- being able to communicate easily is not a gift for everyone as most people take for granted. ""Fearless"" as well.) 2. The story is so well written around the main character, Lara -- she herself has many facets to her personality, but no other character sees all of them. Each person understands and evokes only one side of her. This creates conflicts within the character, which the actresses do a great job of expressing.What a terrific movie. flashdance was such a good idea on paper, but the translation to film was a complete failure.  well..not complete, i liked it for one sit down. i will watch jenseits der stille again, as i do most subtitled films and enjoy it again. thank you ms. link, the cast and especially tatjana trieb and sylvie testud. you touched me.

David and the cast did an outstanding job, and while the filmed script may not have been the original one (I'd love to see it sometime) the end result is fabulous. If you haven't seen it, you should, and I hope you too laugh, and smile, and chuckle, and enjoy a rather grand movie. Enjoy! Heche. This wasn't a huge hit at the box office but it should play well on video. Although involving pirate in the subplot seems out of place with the story. It's entertaining enough to overcome certain flaws in the movie. Probably the best thing of the picture is Ford, which he's especially loose and funny. Certainly worth viewing. Panavision.

This was Paramount's last stab (pun intended) at things before selling the rights to New Line Cinema, which basically destroyed the series with absurd ideas like Jason switching bodies and rampaging through spaceships. Not great, but not godawful, this film carries limited appeal outside of fanboy circles. girls, the lack of effort that the writers put into the film is clearly evident. It's almost as if the writers got together and tried to figure out how to fit the maximum amount of gratuitous violence and nudity into an hour and a half movie... sheer brilliance.For me? 8/10, one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. course.The film's duration is also unusually long, I think it lasts for over one and a half hour.The only let-downs in this installment is an INCREDIBLY lame throat-slashing scene (minor), and a weak ending (major). This is why I give it 8 out of 10 and not the top-score.Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did! Ninja Turtles movie. Also(SEMI SPOILER)thank God the movie has the heart not to kill the dog. When you kill a person in the movie it's whatever but when you kill an animal it's much worse.

Halloween (1978)	they could've been around to see this film when it was brand new!Looking back, Halloween probably scared me more when it was new, than other horror movies have,when they were new.  Horror films are indebted to Halloween for breaking some new ground, and I can't wait for the next horror film that will do something on a similar scale.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.

Highest Reguards.10/10 Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date.

Halloween II (1981)	work. I wish a little time had lapsed and they followed similar plot-builds as H1. The ending chase scene should have gone on longer, those are the best parts.

It doesn't ruin the integrity of the original film like most sequels do. to be expected.  Though I always feel sorry for the guy that gets hit by the car as he is obviously not Myers.  There is a television version of this one that totally blows as it is very toned down and they even have a happier ending.  Watch the uncut theater version as it is much better. today.  And with good reason, it is not a bad film by any means. Nothing was going to compare to the original, but the isolated hospital setting and inspired performances from all involved make this a worthy companion to the first film, and more of an inspiration to slasher films of the 80's than it is given credit for. 	6.6	0

Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)	you only wished it could hold it throughout. Still Michael is used unnervingly as a foreshadow within the background of many shots and it always seems to work as he could be lurking anywhere. Also the creative novelty of the film's opening credits is a nice touch. It's more of the same, but an watchable pedestrian slasher blanketed with shocks. I wasn't scared by Michael, he's loosing his touch... no, I can't say that, please I can't say that... it's the writing! It's the blasted writing! So if you wanna see the sequels, yeah, do watch it just to see the story continue, but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general, you can skip Halloween 5.5/10 the one he wore in the previous films? One good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.  There is also an enigmatic Man in the Black Fedora-type figure who leads the film into the far superior Part 6. missed opportunities of Halloween 5, as the aftermath of the fourth film's conclusion suggested an interesting new direction for the series that is never made tangible. Instead we're forced to endure a stale entry that's full of logical inconsistencies.All of that said, this entry is still superior to Halloween 3, and methinks that's worth at least an extra half star. and Tamara Glynn. It is hard to tell if there are more squeals than thrills. My main complaint is they kill off Rachel(Cornell)way too quickly. Miss Harris is left with the most serious acting and does very well. This time it is Don Shanks playing the maniacal white masked menace. The finale is quite brutal, but is it brutal enough? 	5.2	0
Prom Night (1980)	"a few scenes where the lighting is way too low and the disco prom dates the film, it does hold it's own.

There's also a few good rock numbers like ""Prom Night"" and the mellow ""Fade to Black"".Worth a look for slasher fans.*** out of **** distracted, and seems to duck off in a phone-in performance and George Touliatos gives the film some solidarity. Anne-Marie Martin is a delight as the scheming sexpot Wendy, David Mucci is perfect as the boorish brute Lou and Casey Stevens is modest as Curtis' prom date Nick.This post-Halloween slasher is familiar and slowly plotted, but its competent technical handling helps. most of them, even the vicious Wendy. The poor girl gets chased around the classrooms for so long, you almost want her to make it out of the movie alive. This is a very creepy and underrated horror film that should be seen by all. Much better than the sequels and the ""remake"" which was done a few years ago.8/10 movie on or notice it in a video store I would suggest giving it a look. I would love to see a remake, ONLY if they kept the plot the same, but intensified the horror, much like what was done in TTCM remake. And, of course, to have Edie Benton and Jamie Leigh make an cameo or guest appearance somewhere! awful quality that it's really quite hard to see what's going on on the screen, and I hear that the DVD isn't any better, so I think we could all benefit from a remastered version, or even a remake at this point.6/10 is my vote.

Prom Night III: The Last Kiss (1989)	"juvenile - sense of humor to get the most out of it. If you ever snickered at the humor and one-liners of Freddy Krueger, Angela Baker, or even the Wishmaster, you'll probably like this incarnation of Mary Lou. In any case, this film is very representative of its time and genre, in good ways and bad, depending on your take. for, but in the process, she begins killing people in Alex's way, and the police come after Alex! There were many gorey but funny scenes in the movie, like when Mary Lou appears at the ice cream stand in the classroom. It tried to be scary, but turned out more funny and entertaining. I give Prom Night III a 6/10. watched the film again and really loved it. I liked the humour in this film and found it to be entertaining. I take back what I said about it in my user comment on Prom Night IV: Deliver us From Evil. Actually, I like it more than Prom Night IV. The acting was okay also, as were the gore effects! to add a bunch of different elements to it as well. It's all over the place and not as good as part II.Mary Lou is completely different from the vixen we knew her as in ""Hello Mary Lou"". The ending is also very bizarre, but original at least. Prom Night III doesn't take itself very seriously, and neither do I.5/10 she leaves corpses in her wake. Interesting, clever and original deaths along with a great sense of humor make this one I really have enjoyed over the years. It is more of a comedy-horror film.

Prom Night IV: Deliver Us From Evil (1992)	"at not letting up, despite following the rules strongly.  The extended scenes before the slasher starts on the teens build everything up quite well.This is a slasher movie, and you will enjoy it only if you're in the mood for one.  However, it does what it does well, and as such is worth picking up if you are. the body count & bloodshed, this sure could have turned into one of the unsung slasher gems from the early '90s. Now it just remains a curiosity for those interested in the ""Prom Night"" series. It's a strange franchise, to say the least, with this 4th installment presenting us yet again a different storyline. Interesting, but a failed effort altogether. a murdering priest was kind of interesting.  If you want a great horror film, rent ""Psycho"" (or even ""Night of the Demons""), but if you want something to pass the time, rent this movie.  It is worth watching for horror fans.  Just don't expect to see Mary Lou from the 2nd and 3rd installments in the series. Us from Evil"" caught me off guard, in a good way. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does spin it with style, and is also closer to the 1980 film in spirit than the former two sequels—and possibly better in some ways. For an early-nineties slasher entry, this one is wildly amusing and at times even effectively moody. 7/10. installment holds nothing back whatsoever. There's plenty of blood, and there's gross out scenes to boot. The ""final girl"" is interesting, and you're rooting for her the entire time.

Child's Play (1988)	"a very creepy atmosphere inside it's urban landscape.While many reviewers consider a flaw the fact that Chucky's possession is not a mystery, I believe that a lot of the suspense is in the fact that we know that, but the characters don't. It is a very well constructed film in the end, and definitely better than its current sequels. 8/10 frightening and classy,this is a nerve-wracking experience.I actually found ""Child's Play"" to be a very scary film.I did not find it too gory,but what gore there is it was done to heighten intensity levels to the extreme.All in all,I wholeheartedly recommend it to any open-minded viewer,who likes to watch horror movies.The hammer in the head scene still gives me goosebumps. about anything like plot holes or continuity errors. A few I noticed: how DID he go into Chucky, besides the chant, why would the Chucky doll be burned up, the dates continuously change. That scene with voodoo was very cool. That's about all I can say, so I won't say any more.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language and violent situations. eyes and perma-smiles seem insincere. Overall, Child's Play is a movie that probably succeeded because it was in the right place at the right time. Nonetheless, it's worth at least a few viewings. Chucky is easily one of the top 3 horror movie villains of the 1980s along with Freddie Krueger and the Gremlins. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars playtime.After this film, the only sequel I highly recommend is Child's Play 2, which I love just about as much as this one. Part 3 wasn't bad. Bride of Chucky was an interesting new direction to go in, but the feeling of the first couple of films is long gone by then, and Seed of Chucky was about the same. "	6.6	0
Child's Play 2 (1990)	good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got.

Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however. Overall, a fun sequel to the original, with a well rounded cast and plenty of thrills to keep one entertained. enjoyed the characters of Andy and Kyle. Vincent portrayed Andy with innocence but determination and Christine Elise gave a rebellious yet tender-hearted and strong portrayal of foster teenager Kyle. Brad Dourif gave another sinister, dark, and sarcastically funny portrayal of Chucky.The overall horror elements may seem tame by more recent standards, but it's still a rather entertaining horror sequel.Grade B its flaw, Child's Play 2 just about does the job. If you liked the first one, this one does its best to keep the franchise going along the same lines. However, if you're new to the films, I'd start off with the first one (it's easily the best and scariest) before seeing if you want to watch this one, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/ He brought on a incredible performance going against Chucky once again. Also Brad Dourif did great playing the Voice of Chucky. Chucky was funny and dangerous this time around again.

Yet it's not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact, it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early '90s. film. I do not understand why this movie is so underrated. Is it because of the time lapse? Maybe because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason, this movie deserves much more than a 4.1 rating (as of 3/7/08). I say it gets 9/10.

No.Absolutely horrible movie? No.I was entertained and got exactly what I was looking for... thus it earns a 7 from me. You want a horrible horror movie that deserves its three - check out Leprachaun 4. Horror hit classic and Brad Dourif did great again playing the voice of Chucky.The film had different plot points and all new cast. Child's Play 3 was good into The Child Play Series. I recommend this one to everyone as well. Child's Play and Child's Play 2 with Alex Vincent amazing horror classic. Child's Play 3 another great horror comeback. with Andrew Robinson stealing his scenes as a barber who really enjoys shaving the heads of the cadets. In fact I loved the little ponytails hung on the walls of his salon. A neat little addition. The story is nothing special though, and the film is very formulaic.

Anything less than a perfect film would have spoiled what was literally a perfect day. It didn't. Robins, and Heather O'Rourke equally good as their kids. The late Oscar-winning actress Beatrice Straight (""Network"") scores points as a parapsycologist investigating the hauntings, and Zelda Rubinstein steals scenes as the mysterious clairvoyant brought in to ""clean house"".

Also, the children remained good actors, especially the late Heather O'Rourke, who played Carol Anne.  This is another strong performance by the young actress, and would have gone on to be a wonderful adult actress later in life had she lived.  All in all, I give it a 7.5 out of 10. out.

The ending was just plain lame and only makes this one worse than it is.  As not good as this is though, the next Poltergeist makes this one look a lot better.

The way they made the concept of the mirrors work is amazing and I thought it was a great attempt a something new. I gave this movie a 9/10 because of how much I enjoyed Heather O'Rourke's performance. Check it out. I'm not going all out to say that the acting was high quality or that it goes down in my books as a classic horror movie but I think it's highly underrated. It's an incredibly dark, terrifying movie in my opinion. I think it's by far the scariest of the three Poltergeist movies, although the original Poltergeist is my favorite. good cast (Heather O'Rourke, Lara Flynn Boyle, Nancy Allen, Tom Skerritt), GREAT special effects, and has some scary moments to boot.  It's certainly better than some of the 80's ""slasher"" movies, where too many sequels ruined the originals, and I honestly think that it rates up there as being a very underrated horror movie of its time.  :-) shoot the final scenes of the movie which creates an odd and choppy ending.This movie is a sad final chapter in the Potergeist series.

Exorcist, The (1973)	it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A. evil.  It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects.  It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work.  In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there. and the total feeling of evil around the room, we'll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It's a masterpiece of a film that's more than a mere horror flick.10/10 performances.  Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension of a mother of the cusp of tragedy; Max von Sydow is hauntingly perfect as the story's ray of light;   Jason Miller embodies the sadness of a defeated man; and Linda Blair is far above average even at her young age.Once again, see this movie.  You won't forget it. the experienced Father Merrin.Merrin arrives like a knight in shining armour for the ultimate showdown! A great screenplay by William Peter Blatty (based on his book), intelligent directing from William Friedken and outstanding performances from all the cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn as the traumatised mother make for a classic piece of horror that will stand the test of time. 10/10 	8.0	1

I can recall very few films that have a better sense of the power of stillness and silence. So much of the violence is communicated only in dialogue; your mind reluctantly does the rest. oh there is PLENTY of disturbing, shocking stuff to imagine. In one conversation you'll hear about a murder so vile that you'll never want to hear the word ""catheter"" again. And the beauty is that you never see a thing. If this subtle style appeals to you, then you certainly won't be disappointed.10/10. And I don't give 10s very often. director's shoulder, it's still a great film. I'm probably one of the few people who are actually satisfied with the movie. I wished Blatty could have the original version of this film restored. I enjoyed the book and the movie as well.Highly recommended!A majority of people hate intellectual horror films. What's wrong with having to think once in a while? and the silence, then suddenly... well I wont give anything away. Its definitely different to the original so if your looking for another The Exorcist then look elsewhere, but this will probably still scare the daylights out of you.Overall, fantastic film and I'm glad that Father Karras is in this film because I loved his character in the original. 9/10 the nightmare literally, does it inevitably become a little daft (but that charge could even be levied at 'The Excorcist' itself).

The movie rushes along at a feverish pace, and particularly Gibson's and Glover's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed. drama cleverly constructed... The final battle, where the two cops team up against the general and his henchmen, is especially thrilling... Donner's film also skates around the sexual implications of male bonding, but the scene in which Gibson and Glover are captured by the crooks and tortured dramatizes male vulnerability in a manner that became familiar in the action film... Roger Murtaugh (Glover in one great comic role), who is constantly reminded of his age and the danger he's constantly in: solving a drug-linked homicide of Murtaugh's friend's daughter.  Busey is memorable as an albino mercenary, Mr. Joshua, unsusceptible to pain.  Some great stunts and lots of thrills thanks to helmsman Richard Donner (who also directed the sequels). One of the best fitting scenes in film history. I also admire Gibson and Busey doing their own stunts, and studying martial arts, just to make 4 nights of filming a cult fighting scene for this excellent movie. This one is definitely a winner! If you haven't seen this superb film, then I STRONGLY recommend that you do! Great film! He gives the action credibility unlike ""actors"" like Sylvester Stallone or Steven Segal. You genuinely believe that he could be able to shoot someone with a sniper rifle at a distance of 1 - 2 kilometers.All in all a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb. 9/10 - watch this movie right now!

Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)	"quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichés, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies. provide these characters with depth that could easily have been lacking and the ending of this film leaves the audience actually feeling the love these two men have for each other. And, as a bonus, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" digs even deeper into one of the protagonist's past, shedding even more light as to why he is the way he is. the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own. 8/10  Truly despicable villains, 5.  Revenge story that pops out of nowhere really (this is quite surprising for a Gibson flick mind you).  This one's the best of the series. Part three was a joke.  Part four...I dunno what the hell that one was. Part one was pure setup baby.  This is the one.  > is the best thing that could have ever happened to the movie.It's not just the performances either. LW2 is an excellent follow-up to the original that spawned 4 sequels and is a MUST-SEE. As a matter of fact, I personally find it to be the best movie throughout the series.

It's followed by the last chapter 'Lethal weapon 4' with same players adding to Jet Li and Chris Rock. the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  ""Lethal Weapon 3"" again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric Clapton/Sting song ""It's Gonna Be Me.""  My score:  8 (out of 10) mean bastard, a traitor, almost a symbol of the back-side of the medallion.The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.All in all a great entry to a great series. 7/10 well worn characters - like old shoes!  Pesci is not quite as annoying as he was in LW2 but is still a bit of a spare wheel.  Russo is good as the love interest and handles herself well.Overall it's good fun but it lacks the dark, rough tone that made LW such a hit in the first place. He kind of helps them with this case and again he is very good for the comedy.This is a fine installment although things get more and more familiar. Still, as long as it is spectacular and funny that doesn't really matter. The fun Gibson, Glover and director Richard Donner must have making this movie is clearly visible on the screen. "	6.7	0

Six years later came the ""Gremlins"" sequel ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"". It wasn't as good as the original, but it's still a good movie sequel.

""scary movie"". I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot. I would recommend maybe six years or older, and if they get too scared, tell them it's really just puppets. (It is.) Overall, this film is entertaining, very 80's, a little scary, and pretty funny. ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad.

Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)	"film because of its total irreverence compared to the first; it didn't try to be scary for a second and Rick Baker's creature effects turned out goofier than Chris Walas's original creature designs.  Just realize...this is a comedy! Definitely worth seeing more than once to catch the barrage of jokes and references...and sit all the way through the credits! Sol! Throwing in as many film references as it can, Gremlins 2 may have a satirical slant at it's heart, but sure enough the fun from the first film segues nicely into this picture to make this one of the better, and more smarter sequels on the market.And those darn Gremlins are nastier and uglier than ever as well! 8/10 E.T. were made.  Movies aren't the same anymore and that is not neccessarily a criticism, it is just a comment pointing out that in the early 90's and the 80's movies were just different sometimes.  This is one of the funnier ones, and one of the more entertaining.  Do you remember a film by Amblin that wasn't? movie virtually every kid knows what the Gremlins are and are familiar with Gizmo (who may well be the cutest thing that ever existed). It's still a huge cash cow and a recognizable brand, and why Warner never greenlit Gremlins 3 is puzzling to say the absolute least.One last thing. Stay with this film until the end of the credits. wholesome (despite not being married, however) couple who live together who, of course, know all about these gremlins.It was nice to see Jackie Joseph (of the original ""Little Shop Of Horrors"") again as well as some other well-known characters such as Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, Dick Miller and Keye Luke.

Mask of Zorro, The (1998)	"script. Emotion and comedy at the same time. Great visuals and scenery and also good action.In my opinion this a highly underrated movie (6.7 for 2013 doesn't give it justice at all) and it belongs among the best. For the friend who gave a low rating a note: Not all the dramas have to be edgy and dark.Overall: Highly recommended there is serves the plot instead of BEING the plot. The best movie I've seen in a long time. Note: previews make it look a lot less interesting than it actually is--you just see a lot of things being slashed and blown up, while the comic scenes between Hopkins and Banderas don't really appear (the best part of the film). but for a movie like this it is a perfect story. Anthony Hopkins who is never bad does not disappoint us here, Banderas has the right charm to play Zorro, Zeta-Jones is absolutely stunning and Wilson and Letscher are very good as the villains. With some nice action sequences and a pretty good soundtrack this is a very entertaining movie. some of the comical moments is done very well, unlike some other movies from the same genre.There is some nice cinematography that help to create a good atmosphere along with the musical score from James Horner. The end fight is good and it has a spectacular big explosion in it that'll make you go; Wow!Great entertainment for the whole family.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ with this movie and she's never looked better. Hopkins, as usual, is the best character as the older ""Zorro"" who teaches the young one (Bandaras). Some of the action scenes are almost cartoon-like in credibility (Bandaras doing flips while riding two horses at once!) but they are fun.The story is a familiar one that seems to always satisfy people: revenge.

Polish Wedding (1998)	family in the world either.  Don't watch this if you're expecting edge-of-your seat drama, steamy sex and car chases.  But if you're in the mood for an intimate and fun look at a working class family, then this is one for you.  I rank it nearly as good as The Sweet Hereafter for its realism.My rating: 7 culture and society, when they created that horrible movie. If there is even minimal piece of true in this, i'm packing my little, yellow rucksack and beginning journey to find mythical, fromPolishWeddingish Poland. Don't watch it, please, waste of time and braincells! You going to die in never-ending, intellectual pain, if your imagination is fastidious. Use it on your enemies!!! meal :-) They don't smoke more than other nationalities. Music seemed to be rather Balkan. There are many Polish names but I don't recognize many Polish features and it completely misses Polish family atmosphere. 3. People kneeling before Hala crowned with garland. What was that? Does Teresa Conelly think that Poles recognized in her Virgin Mary? It's totally stupid scene. baby-obsessed liars, which is completely untrue. Who had the dumb idea to do this movie anyways? if the story had moved a little more quickly and if the characters had not been so flat and un-dynamic. Anyone with a hint of Polish in their blood might even find this film more offensive that self-relevant. It casts a bad picture onto a people with a far more interesting family tradition than is seen in this artificial construction. 	5.4	0
This World, Then the Fireworks (1997)	her appetite for Marty that it seemed she couldnt live unless she was breathing the air he just exhaled.I gave this film a 7/10.  It is a 10 as far as filmmaking and period authenticity and the story was about a 5.  If you like film noir, unabashed lust and the fifties, this movie is a must see. a rather unwholesome way), and finding that the passing of years has reduced the town to a squalid ragdump, rife with sordid lives and ubiquitary misery. Relentlessly dark and subtly sardonic ultra-noir, with even the most likable characters suppressing some degree of unscrupulous shadiness. Not a joyful diversion, but effective, and surprisingly sincere in its illustration of the source material.6/10...recommended. is made for Billy Zane, and features the finest performance I've ever seen from him. Don't miss this unforgettable scene: someone wonders why he (Billy Zane) would marry a deformed woman when he can have a beautiful one, and he becomes absolutely enraged. Also wonderful are Gina Gershon as the sister, and Rue McClanahan as mother of the wicked siblings. things, and about the moral values of society. It has a wonderful visual style, portrays an amazingly consistent world.The whole film has an air of sadness pervading it that sticks with me five years on.Difficult viewing, but wonderful.If you see this for rent or cheap purchase anywhere, grab it and see one of the most individual and haunting films ever. film.  I consider this film one of my top 10, mostly because the characterization of Billy Zane's character may be the best in any movie ever. This movies has almost everything you want: Original Awesome Characterization (especially with Zane's Character) Sufficiently well written and actedMaybe this movie isn't what the mainstream wants, but it is still an excellent flick. 	5.1	0
Soylent Green (1973)	"go wrong with Man's stewardship of Earth. It's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the ""old days"" of the past (which is our present), and note how Thorn is incapable of comprehending what Sol is saying.This film is one of my top sci-fi films of all time. 2022 looks like 1973 is entirely plausible because society has gone retrograde. Charlton Heston's performance is beautifully nuanced and believable. Edward G. Robinson is unforgettable as Sol. References to this movie pop up in shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Millennium"" for the simple reason that it is a visionary look at the future with real heart - a true classic. that is good but not without its faults. The narrative is reasonably interesting and carries the film all the way to a nice (but too well-known) conclusion but it is in the general vision of the future of a world where the people are struggling to get by with resources running low. A smart sci-fi that is well worth seeing. people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors. Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are. really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound. "	7.1	0
Metropolis (1927)	"possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years. special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways (except that the two films can hardly be compared)  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film, Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten. nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now I've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been. must have in the late 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style. Metropolis may not be for everyone, but, for those willing to read between the lines, this film still has a lot to offer! great director was able to produce such special effects in 1927, with very primitive cameras and equipment. The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York. The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role, and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Metropolis"" "	8.3	1
Back to the Future Part II (1989)	"II weird. This film get's 8 ""Back to the Future"" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore. Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015.  It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A. Future fans, not to mention, it's just good to see where these stories go. Like I said, it's not as good as the first, but it is a good movie and actually a little better than a 7.1, if you ask me. But that's just me, so just give this movie a chance, you just might find yourself enjoying it.9/10 movie to see what the 80's were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70's)I recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can't watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence.Have fun! (I recommend the trilogy box, you can purchase it anywhere) is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already).Highly recommended. "	7.8	1

And when you live in my memory forever, you get my grade.  For Back To The Future Part III it's an A+. As for the trilogy, there is no grade high enough, no rating high enough, for me to give it the award it so richly deserves. that in mind and would be best advised to let it go. Zemeckis and Gale have said repeatedly that they don't plan on ever continuing the story. And why should they? Everything has been said, everything has been done. The movies are perfect the way they are. Let's be thankful there are still filmmakers that stick to their artistic conviction. do the previous two films. They are all a huge amount of fun to watch, and the films can be enjoyed by people of all ages, which is a quality that few films possess.If you haven't seen these films, go out and get them, and if you have seen them, you may want to go out and watch them again. 	7.4	0
Poseidon Adventure, The (1972)	"adds a welcome touch of humor to the mess. No, the movie is not perfect, and it is of course starting to look a bit dated. However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored. Poseidon Adventure is a true classic. A must see for everyone--not just disaster movie fans. hoping for rescue from above.The idea is well conceived and the excellent cast turn in good performances despite getting little help from the somewhat corny script. With above average special effects for the time and excellent sets that convincingly realise the upside down half-flooded ship and its bewildering maze of passageways, the movie manages to be compelling and exciting viewing. upside down) of the ship. At first, the ocean claims hundreds of the passengers until they are whittled down to about 10 people left. From here there are plenty of tense moments and a power struggle for control of the survivors. Typical disaster movie fare but done rather well.This movie is a great main event for a disaster film weekend. Titanic tendency of stamping ""I'm gonna die"" on people's foreheads, in the Poseidon Adventure you don't know initially who's going to die- or at least not how or when anyway.The Poseidon Adventure is just a more interesting movie.  It may not be as glossy or as pretty, but it's got it where it counts... it's just a better film. enough.plus,the fact that the survivors had to go through what amounted to a labyrinthine maze as they tried to get out,really added to the feeling of hopelessness of the situation.i was also surprised at who ultimately survived and who didn't.for a nearly 2 hour movie,this one moves along pretty good.i was engrossed throughout.for me,The Poseidon adventure is a strong 8/10 "	7.1	0

Absent Minded Professor, The (1961)	seeing bounce slowly into the stratosphere before a quick thinking Tommy Kirk devises a way to counteract his flubberized dad.The AbsentMinded Professor was so popular with audiences that Disney did another version with almost the entire same cast in Son of Flubber.That one was almost as funny, but this still has a lot of laughs even after almost fifty years. Hawk character also returns in Herbie Rides Again (same actor, same personality). Small coincidence, because the movie was also directed by Robert Stevenson.So, if you are looking for a film that will not offend, and offer a few chuckles and will captivate your child's attention, check out The Absent Minded Professor.Also, IMHO, do not wast time with the Flubber remake.CheersC contacts bonkers. The movie is much more inspired, likable and family-friendly (not to mention funnier and more charming) than the remake starring Robin Williams, which was written by John Hughes long after his career had fallen downwards. This version is the definitive version--don't let the kiddies convince you to rent the other one before you see this one!**** / ***** real scene stealer in this film is Keenan Wynne as old man Hawk.  Mr. Hawk was probably one of the biggest weasels in cinematic history and Tommy Kirk is also great as his son Biff. Also, the best scene in the whole film is the basketball game.  That scene alone is what makes this film a classic comedy. course, someone is trying to kidnap this idea, and it's up to some children to save the day.I am not sure what children today would think of this film, but I did find it enjoyable, and I would have seen it in the mid-1980s. I would like to think that children today would find it just as enjoyable and entertaining. 	6.8	0
Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, The (1979)	"when I remembered how did Marshal Wooly Bill Hitchcock go after the Apple Dumpling Gang. In my opinion this sequel to the first Apple Dumpling Gang was a great improvement from its original version in both comedic content and character development, and its story line. I highly recommend this sequel for clean family fun and entertainment. Steve Horvath, Chicago, IL at a movie in my life. I'm very disappointed in the rating this comedy has gotten... this film was one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original. A definite must-see for all Tim Conway fans (""Where is your horn, little boy blue."")Granted, there are some smarmy moments... but Tim and Don shine in this comedy for the whole family! the whole fort down, a bit taken from the Gary Cooper comedy, Cassanova Brown. Second best scene is Knotts and Conway in drag as saloon entertainers, taken of course from Some Like It Hot.Reused material or not, the stuff is very funny and more than kids will get laughs from two comic geniuses in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again. this movie because it is something that everybody can watch and enjoy!  This almost surpasses Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run 2..  It's a must see..  Tim Conway was as funny as he has been in some of his other movies like the Dwarf..

He makes the statement relavent that he is very, very, very versatile, and one of our greatest entertainment treasures. I still love it, and I always associate certain scenes with certain memories, and now that I'm older I understand what is going on a little bit better (not to mention some of the jokes that flew right over my head when I was four!)! If you don't watch it for yourself, you're kids'll love it. Believe me, I know! effects, it was a special event.  However, on the small screen it does lose something of its effect, but it's still a good movie.  The scene where TomTom has been shrunk, and takes his revenge on Barnaby by losing the wooden soldiers on him still gives me goosebumps.Probably better for younger children, I still wouldn't miss this film. the night in the forest. In the morning, the band were ""captured"" by the trees of the forest and escorted to Toyland to see the Toymaker. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.Overall, this film's a wonderful Disney production; too bad it had a disappointing box office performance. even in Toyland.I even think Victor Herbert would have approved of the way his numbers were done though he probably would not like the Disney interpolations that were made. He was a stickler for such things in his life.Viewing March Of The Wooden Soldiers back to back with Babes In Toyland doesn't make this version look inferior by any means. "	6.3	0
Bambi (1942)	"that there is nothing else in the world, outside the forest.  Not once do we see a horizon.  Nor do we sense one.  By some standards not much happens in the forest - a few deaths, a few births, what else is new?  But when the forest is the whole world they matter a good deal. was there to show the passage of time and how it changes everything, even the woodland creatures we take for granted? It's an amazing achievement. The song score never elicited a hit the size of, say, ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", but it does feature the sprightly ""Little April Showers"", which underscores the very best sequence. ***1/2 from **** of the woodlands makes you wonder if modern animators haven't been spoiled by computer graphics.   I'm only sorry I probably won't ever see this film in a theatre, as it was meant to be seen.   As cliche as it may sound, this is a timeless film for all ages.  I cannot praise it highly enough. stay fresh and young forever. An awesome achievement!In conclusion, having done some choral work myself as a glee club singer, I especially appreciated the great contribution made by the mixed chorus (male/female) that does such a wonderful job on all of the choruses that blend so seamlessly with the rich background score. Truly exceptional choral vocals conducted by Charles Henderson. way man is handled in the film is surprisingly mature: instead of putting the main characters against a laughable caricature, mankind's presence is unseen and feels more like a natural disaster than a living entity. In fact, Bambi might be one of the most adult films in the Disney animated canon. Ignore its saccharine reputation and give it another look. "	7.3	0

(1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972). will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.  This one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt. Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite. cannot urge anyone enough to see this film, the images are true cinematic poetry rich with so much emotion that I cannot even describe them in words. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa's works, then please see Seven Samurai... you will witness the true beauty, excellence and magic that the art form known as film is capable of. once), but there is little that you could cut out, even if you wanted to.

Dangerous Liaisons (1988)	"but one that fascinates in its exposure of ego, vanity, intrigue and the war between the genders, subjects that are timeless in their relevance, despite the period setting. The storyline, which sticks faithfully to the original novel, remains compelling throughout as we watch deceits within deceits take their tragic course. Whole-heartedly recommended - take your time over it, and enjoy. life and keep it going with their dialog and actions. Keanu? Shudder, his acting is like... how do I put this delicately? I think it's... wood. :) Otherwise, trust me this is one of the best movies of all time. This deserves higher than a 7.6 and should be in the top 250. But it's beyond my control. :D 10/10 Uma Thurman is amazing with a tremendous mix of innocence and sexuality. The script and the direction really made an amazing job giving an environment of sickness and degradation. The makeup and the beautiful costumes only aggregate the force that the story needed to be told. An amazing movie you really wish to enter in that snake's nest. Highly recommended. for an action film - he appears wooden - but does a decent job, anyway. Lastly, Uma is refreshing and captivating, and plays opposite John Malkovitch without losing her identity.

Dune (1984)	Science-Fiction fan should have seen this movie which is a jewel under all those mediocre films that were spawned by Star Wars at that time. All the fans of the book should see it as what it is: A movie based on Dune. If you want the book word by word, don't watch the movie and read the book again. all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version. not to see Stewart as Halleck. The timing of the acting and events is almost perfect. If Lynch had had help by a better scriptwriter to curb some of his wilder additions and flesh out the plot a bit and this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever. As is, it is very good, but somewhat flawed. and telepathic wiring with a fabric behind reason. A woman with her box of illusory sensations. A space flight through the doors of perception. It's heady. None of it really works, because Herbert's synchretic universe is not one of internal martial arts, what we see matters. But does any of it remind you of a David Lynch film you know? very Lynch-ien, even though we rarely get to see them. Overall, a sci-fi epic that requires a lethargic butt, an open mind, and a copy of Frank Herbert's novel to enjoy. Still, it is far superior to the TV miniseries of late (I know saying that is blasphemy to some). I refuse to rate this with stars or anything else. 	6.6	0
Last Temptation of Christ, The (1988)	"Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted, beautifully shot on Moroccan locations, and full of telling ideas, it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays ill-suited modernisms, but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thought-provoking films ever made. descent of characters. American accent = Israelite; British accent = Roman), but it doesn't even matter. Keitel is brilliant no matter what his accent is.Honest, human, loving, and unafraid, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Martin Scorsese crafted with this film his most personal masterpiece, and perhaps his greatest masterpiece ever. that scripture does not rule out.Consider it this way: this is the sort of film that has the power to convince the irreligious or non-Christians out there (of which I am one) of the importance, beauty, depth, and truth of Jesus' vision of a world filled with love and compassion. Give this movie a chance. You will not be disappointed. the beginning of the movie says it all. It is not necessarily based on events in the Bible. Just as Jesus used parables as a way of teaching, this movie tells a story of a man's life and events that we can all somehow personally relate to. By the way, the portrayal of Satan was the best I've seen yet. movie with all around excellent performances, particularly Harvey Keitel as Judas and Willem Defoe as Jesus.  The ""Last Temptation"" segment which draws most of the movie's criticism, is the most important part of all because it shows how close God truly is to us, if only those critics would watch the movie before judging it, they might realize that.

Godfather: Part III, The (1990)	I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II - All in all, I'm really glad I've seen it and I'm sure I'll see it again. was tremendously well shot and very climatic, filled with a lot of excitement. I'm telling you this movie is a great ending to the saga even because of that one particular scene so just go see it, despite what a lot of people have said about, badmouthing it for faulty reasons.. it brought a tear into my eye. It did. but when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.Finally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized. other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it's heart it's a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It's not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film. a violent scene like the murder of the heads of the 5 families does not make it a bad movie, but in this case, a beautiful one.

""The Rapture"" is not a tame flick, and does not shy away from controversial discourse, but all in all, this is a rewarding picture that gets its viewers to think about their lives and what they believe in. No doubt you will be entranced. Rating: Three stars and a half. breaks down is extremely powerful.The film does look a little low budget, especially near the end, but it's a movie about ideas and emotion, not spectacle. It's a thoughtful and thorough film, with an articulate point of view that doesn't judge its characters who enjoy evangelical faith...which is rather unlike the judgmental view of the God we're usually presented with. seems to me a perfect example of a movie designed to start useful discussions about what it means to be outwardly ""religious"" in an ""us vs. them"" mindset rather than truly, inclusively spiritual. I don't recall any public commentary about this movie when it came out at all, yet I'd say it is far more the provocative of the two. remarkable and torturous journey of a woman brought to madness and questioning all that she believes in. This film haunts you long afterwards like witnessing a roadside accident. You are mesmerized by the horror of it while at the same time wanting to turn away.

Rather than shocking us (and having us pull away in revulsion), Lyne draws us in and makes us face the Humbert in ourselves.  This is an incredibly powerful film. is a fine film with great production values, terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book, even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks. and phrasing of a man in a cell continually going over things in his own mind, embellishing and exaggerating and confusing and speculating and sometimes not at all sure about any of it. He brings this same voice to the voiceovers in the film, but it conflicts with the images which purport to represent a narrative stance of ""real truth"". Jeremy Irons is as good as his predecessor James Mason.  Frank Langella's interpretation of Quilty entirely diverges from the one given by Peter Sellers (and rightfully so; who wants to compete with Sellers?).  But it is Dominique Swain, outdoing Sue Lyon, who comes closer than what ever seemed possible to embodying the essence of the doomed Dolly Haze. He is appropriately shady, vague, and sinister when he appears from time to time, slowly revealing himself.This is a real winner on many levels and should be up for several awards including best picture, director, actor, actress, and adapted screenplay. Showtime should be congratulated for its smart acquisition. I hope the movie finds its way to the largest possible audience. "	6.9	0
Disturbing Behavior (1998)	"of development in some key plot points. I think the entire conspiracy plot behind the conversion of the teens needed to be fleshed out much more, characters needed to be drawn more distinctly, and so on. So I balance out the two halves and come up with a 6 out of 10. Worth renting, but could have been something special. more intelligent cut than the other teen-geared fare being produced in its time. The movie at least aims high, and even when it doesn't quite reach, it never bores.A passable sci-fi teen romp, ""Disturbing Behavior"" is entertaining late-night fodder that, surprisingly, will inspire repeat viewings. It's a shame, though, to think of how much better the whole could have been. paranoid Gavin changes his behavior, the plot becomes silly and flawed, and the conclusion is awful. I saw this movie for the first time on 25 March 2000 and I keep my original opinion that this movie is reasonable, but could be great with improvements in the second-half of the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Comportamento Suspeito"" (""Suspicious Behavior"") bad. A lot of bad language seemed to have been cleaned up for TV. And I'm not sure whether this is something that was edited out, but in one scene, the position of a girl's head relative to her date suggests something that happened in Bill Clinton's White House.It wasn't a classic by any means, but it wasn't too bad. influenced (and included) teen horror revival stuff. Sci-fi element was, even though lacking in any deeper explanation, believable enough, especially the part with problems arising due to puberty related hormone/neurotransmitter surges (i.e. Lorna's sexual turn violent outburst at Steve's house) etc.All in all, not really a shining example of cinematic art but still bearable enough for a late night entertainment.

Grand Canyon (1991)	"the bushes. The dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb. No two by fours, no grand revelations.  What I did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated. Kudos to all involved in this, we need more ""Grand Canyons"" in our lives. 9 out of 10. to do with it (color is simply used to draw the parallel. And the chasm. It's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either). If you view the blacks in this movie as token'  you may want to reassess YOUR angst. You may be seeing only black and white yourself, eh. Just a thought. But 'Grand Canyon' reminds me of the ever-lasting loophole into hope. This is the movie I will never be able to praise sensibly.'Grand Canyon' will stay my guilty pleasure. This is a truly beautiful movie.

Graveyard Shift (1990)	"the lines of HOWLING II !In case you're interested. I would rate this as one of the better horror flicks of the last millennium. If I'm losing my objectivity then it must be a case of collective hypnosis because everyone in this family (and you're talking seriously varied tastes here) likes this flick! I would rate it a 6.75 ! to follow. The big monster is supposed to be very impressive, but you're never able to see it properly. Half of the time, you're wondering ""what? ...what happened ??"" Real shame and waste. I'm convinced that with a few clear and decent special effects and make-up, this movie could have been one of the best horror films of the 90's. fan of Dourif personally, but I respect his ability to shine in campy productions. The story doesn't offer anything in the way of a point, and it's incoherency will annoy many - but if you go into this film with the right sort of expectations, and don't think you're about to see a horror classic, Graveyard Shift really shouldn't disappoint. about Viet Nam when he should be perusing corridors to find whatever's lurking there. The monster itself, if I remember correctly, is one big pile of grossly misshappen, poopy prosthetic puppetry, as is often the case in early 90's King fare. Would you want it any other way? Simple, efficient and impressively gory is what you'll find on this shift. the feature turns silly. Still, there is some good performances by Andrews, Macht and Brad Dourif as the Exterminator. Andrew Diroff, Best Known as The Djinn in ""Wishmaster 1 & 2"" is wasted in a supporting role. Die-Hard fans of Stephen King might forgive some of the flawed. Despite, an messy third act. It is worth a look. (*** ½/*****). "	4.8	0
Outsiders, The (1983)	but this film had a huge tie in with Gone With The Wind, remember. I thought the soft lighting and the creamy edging made the film look very much like IT was filmed in 1939!!!I don't know. I thought the chracters were very engaging and the performances excellent. Lots of people loved this film, regular people like myself, that is. for all concerned. Filmed mostly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a very impressive list of young actors on their way to stardom.The cast includes Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. Also featured are Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, C. Thomas Howell, Gailard Sartain and Ralph Macchio.A coming of age movie that packs a punch. Very much worth your time. much better than I thought it would be. It didn't seem cheesy and small but you felt like you were watching a real film. Even though the Greasers seem to be born into undesirable lives, watching this movie makes you want to go back to 1967 in the Southwest and be a Greaser, too. Fabulous movie and perfect for teenagers. will always be somerevisions and omissions in such an enterprise). He preserved the essence of the class struggle: the eternal conflict between those who were better favored by birth and station (Socs) with those less favored (Greasers). Coppola elicited more than competent performances from the young up-and-coming cast he assembled. All in all, a very good coming of age film. was changed a bit, though, it was basically a better image of the story where you can see through your eyes, so that you were able to picture and make out with what you originally were thinking.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)	"that sounded gross, just trust me this that this is such a fun movie. It's one of my favorite films, I know that sounds bad, but I just love this film. It's a lot of fun and Indiana and Short Round are just the best buddies to watch argue on screen. This is an awesome sequel, definitely a must see.9/10 watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy, it's hard to pick a best and worst film, in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own, and really shouldn't be compared to the other two. new PG-13 rating (""Red Dawn"" and ""The Woman in Red""). It's not a new rating anymore. The PG-13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it'll still go strong in the years to come. But I'll always remember ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" as the leading factor to the creation of the PG-13 rating. Williams' score infuses the sacrifice sequence with a sense of building dread.  The chanting, the heavy drums all building into a wild climax of heart burning and lava filled mayhem.  The mine car chase is wild fun and Indy's bridge manuver is one hell of a climax.  Still don't know why everyone's so down on this movie. plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor. "	7.6	1
Lord of the Rings, The (1978)	and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience. it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers! wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity.

Dead Zone, The (1983)	"lost track of how many times I've watched 'The Dead Zone' over the years, but it never fails to hook me in, and I always get something more out of Walken's performance every time I view it. This movie may not be typical fare from David Cronenberg, but it is one of his most straightforward and entertaining films. Highly recommended. way Johnny is always wearing the black coat reminded me of death (fate). Especially with touch his can see into the future and actually alter what can happen (say death). Maybe it was just I? It isn't gut wrenching stuff (visually speaking) we've come to expect by Cronenberg, but still he nails down a well drawn up and gripping drama/thriller. eerie presence, Sheen's (apparent) ""aw shucks"" demeanor, plus the horrific feeling of Cronenberg and King. You're sure to love it. Also starring are Brooke Adams as Johnny's ex hubby, and Herbert Lom as a doctor (you may expect him to launch into an anti-Clouseau diatribe, but his role here is as far removed from Commissioner Dreyfus as possible).Very well done. but one jewel in the crown of his many achievements, and was said to be so disturbing that overhearing him practicing it gave his neighbors nightmares.I suppose I could try to think of more ways to say it, but there is no need. It can be summed up once and for all in a single sentence. Dead Zone is perfection. has several tremendous moments, but the climax in particular builds to an emotional crescendo. The premise of The Dead Zone is probably rather silly if you stop to think about it, but other than that it is a most impressive film - and still ranks as one of, if not THE, best adaptation of a Stephen King story so far.

Maximum Overdrive (1986)	"knocked off, others devise a plan to escape someplace where they can wait out the possession of the comet.  Its not the most complex of plots of course, but if you like watching stuff get blown up or people hit by cars or trucks, or watching little leaguers getting neatly pressed by steamrollers, this delivers. (Yes, really, a steamroller). scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of. Sadly, I feel that King will never direct again.Note for genre buffs: C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy. a pretty sick review, but keep in mind that this is A MOVIE. Not real life. Even with all of this in mind, I think it is fair to say that Stephen King did a fair job with the directing.  It's by no means fantastic, but it is far better done than most Cult Classic, B-flicks.  Happy watching! on humans, though in the end it is mainly trucks that are featured.  Survivors at a gas station are stranded there as the trucks circle the facility.  They have to find a way out or else.  This isn't a movie that is worthy of awards or something, but I think it is a fun movie to watch. is a silly, campy, funny and highly entertaining movie by Stephen King with a great soundtrack by AC/DC. Despite the awful story, acting and direction, I saw this cult movie again yesterday afternoon and it makes laugh so stupid it is. Fortunately Stephen King has given up directing movies.

Needful Things (1993)	"as exciting as he hoped, so he decided to blow it up with some dramatic music and fire.Well, as I've said in the headline.

As it is, it's good for one viewing but if you've read the novel you're going to be disappointed. their neighbours, is entertaining and contains some good characters and marvelously black comedy.  Though there are a few cheesy moments (like that ridiculous model which is supposed to represent a skinned dog), the film is still a winner.  Max Von Sydow is good as the literally devilish owner of the Needful Things store and the climax is nicely-done. was kind of hard to recognize the story. I think the casting was pretty good and this is a cute little movie to watch if you have some time to kill. But I definitely recommend that you pick up the book and read it if you want the whole story. You'll be shocked to see how much was left out. saves this movie from being low- quality and brings it up to a decent spooky story.I have heard that the TBS version is much better as it feature more characterization (what I found to be the weakest part of the film) but I have not seen it. If anyone has any idea where to acquire it please leave a comment. the weakness and greed of each person. ""Needful Things"" is a horror movie with black humor with a story of greed and evilness.

Cujo (1983)	trapped inside. It makes you think twice about dogs and certainly what you would do in such a situation. Would you run, attack the dog, or wait until help arrives? This is not a fun, campy or cheesy horror film, so don't watch if you're a fan of cheese. It's for those who want to feel suspense, fear and pain. his nasty mouth.Cujo is a good movie.  It is scary, especially the last half hour and it actually has a point.  It also does a fairly good job of bringing King's vision to life.  It is not easy to do that, after all King has a very vivid imagination.  But Cujo comes close.  Very close they may think they will be) with this extremely bloody and gruesome shocker. The attack scenes are about as intense as possible - the director almost pushes them TOO far. But the first half of the movie is plodding, filled with unnecessary scenes, and the kid's constant whining (although justified) is sure to get on your nerves.   (**1/2) and Danny Pintauro as her worried son was equally so. Daniel Hugh Kelly gives a likable performance as the father and of course the endearing dog is worth a mention too. The strong performances make this traumatic experience even more believable.A tautly constructed and work-man like film that won't push the boundaries, but its intensely petrifying in its simple origins. performance as a mother desperate to protect her child and survive herself. Young Danny Pintauro is great as Wallace's horrified child. The supporting cast is good too, as are the numerous St. Bernard's that play our vicious title character.Cujo is a top-notch suspense film that never loses its edge. A must-see, and not just for King fans.**** out of **** 	6.0	0
Children of the Corn (1984)	"rest is a bit mediocre. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are pretty good as the young couple trying to escape the murderous children. And an appearance by R.G. Armstrong is never a bad thing. The movie is a ""loose"" adaption of a Stephen King short story, but the sequels are just absolutely King rapes. So do not bother with those. trash!!""Children of the Corn"" is an enjoyable horror film with a few creepy scenes and some good shocks.The acting is decent enough,and the atmosphere of an isolated town(Gatlin)is well-captured.I've seen the first four parts of this series and they are not really bad(want some crap-check out ""Witchcraft"" series)Enough said-try this one if you enjoy watching horror movies.Very atmospheric score too! Those (not so minor) details however are not enough to warrant the bad press the movie gathered upon release (and Stephen King's severe criticisms). ""Children of the Corn"" is a well performed little soft core horror b-movie that surprisingly enough spawned a franchise and still provides eerie ambiance and creepiness that even, at times, make the few cheap scares work. you were to pigeonhole King's films into 'good' and 'bad', this one would firmly be in the latter side. On it's own, however, it's not all that bad, and if you're a fan of King's work, you'll no doubt find something to like here. Or you might hate it for not living up to the book, one of the two. out onto the highway clutching his sliced throat.  It's a real hair raiser!!

This movie is counted among my most favorites, and I highly recommend it to any with a passion for romance. the acting, but it's more about the sometimes sappy, usually saccharine, but wonderfully heartfelt classic story. Instead of the magic of the original fairytale, Ever After replaces it with the ""magic"" of wit, humour and heart. And there's nothing wrong with that.Funny and charming, Ever After is one of those great movies that can be watched over and over again. and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially ""Walking On Water.""A wonderful movie for all lovers of romance! 10/10 my fingernails) and crumpled the napkins for the popcorn into hopeless little balls.

It's good entertainment. combined with outstanding camera work. the best they can with the material, but they lack real motivation, mirroring the film's lack of direction.

First Love, Last Rites (1997)	 I was disappointed.  Don't bother! camera work, the only other redeeming qualities were Giovanni Ribisi (Joey) and Jeanetta Arnette (Sissle's mom).  Natasha Gregson Wagner's Sissel seemed to a bit too psychotic for my tastes.  Ribisi seems to have much talent, and Arnette's small role helped add moments of humor and excitement.  See this movie for the acting/cinematography, not to be blown away. director who keeps showing her drowning a little bit sick? I think so... Neither here nor there, I guess.First Love, Last Rites is a film of greens and blues, of sunsets and squirming eels. It's a film of beautiful pictures and minimal story. The photography is very fine, but it's not enough to give this film more than a 5/10. they get darring and wana try something new. I hope Jesse Perez makes another movie, the actors were great, well I am a huge fan of Natsha Gerson Wagner. It's a very steamy masterpeace that moves with the charactors and the atmosphere. I have no idea why this film didn't make it big. It sure is a discovery on video! his is an excellent film, marked by nicely nuanced acting brought forth by a splendid first-time director.  The screenplay, editing and cinematography are all first-rate.  Wagner and Burke, in particular, master their roles. Ian McEwan's symbolism in the original story is nicely transferred to the screen.

Atlantic City (1980)	ever become friends exactly, but they each get something from the other until the sad ending, when Lancaster realizes that there isn't a place in his life for Sarandon, and that there may not be a place in the world for him.The film is a low-key character study that completely satisfies, and gives Lancaster perhaps his last great role.Grade: A should also mention Kate Reid who played Grace, the invalid, ex-beauty queen widow of a mobster, who orders Lou about. She does a great job. Her character too will be transformed.If the late, great Louis Malle was running the world the gross transgressors would surely get theirs and the rest of us would find forgiveness for our sins, and renewal. the end they go their separate ways -- Lancaster back to his destiny, and Sarandon in search of hers. The characters in the film bounce around at first, at odds with one another, or simply unaware of the others' presence, but Malle draws them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care about. It's a fine movie. performances of all time and really should have won the Oscar.  Susan Sarandon is also superb, and their scenes together are unforgettable.  Kate Reid as a faded gangster's moll is a standout in the fine supporting cast.  This is perhaps Louis Malle's finest movie, and, in my opinion, one of the 10 best movies of the 80s. City the odious characters and sticky situations are secondary to the development/relationships of the lead characters.  This is the first excellent performance on film of a young Sarandon, and one of the finest performances of Lancaster's distinguished career.This film has been butchered on cable, VHS, and laserdisc.

""I am."" at the end, exhausted and defeated yet again, Taylor demonstrates acting, particularly film acting, at its best. The film is by no means easy or ""Hollywood"" in feel-- the audience is as exhausted as the characters at the end. But this was a bracing, necessary antidote to the impossible ideal of marriage usually portrayed in the movies. A towering film. the kind of film that makes you feel like having a showing (or a very concentrated drink) to wash away the grit and human evil and pain absorbed. You'll feel dirty, but in a way you'll also feel enlightened: that a small character film can carry more punch than any explosion-packed blockbuster out there is a thing of beauty indeed! Burton, George Segal and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances, too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather difficult: It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of nothing but four people talking for two hours, it never bored us for a second. is loaded with uncomfortable moments, enhanced by the camerawork replete with uneasy close-ups. Most of all, this film shows how a lot can be accomplished with just a little: a cast of four and minimal scenery changes.

Which, by the way, got nominated for Best Picture and won the Oscar for Best Song (Talk to the Animals). Rex Harrison's performance is outstanding as the wonderful Doctor Dolittle. I give this timeless film an 8 out of 10. the look and feel of those campy 1960's movies, like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.""  But it also has the same comfy and family-friendly appeal. The original movie best captures the image of Hugh Lofting's famous veterinarian, in 19th-century England, just as he should be!  So never mind Eddie Murphy, and enjoy the real Dr. Dolittle! hour, when Dolittle and his companions hit the South Seas in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Overall, the film simply LOOKS smashing, with marvelous locations in England's most beautiful city, Castle Combe. It is flawed (with that bad opening), but stick with it and see if you find Rex Harrison as charming as I did. **1/2 from **** "	6.2	0
Charlotte's Web (1973)	"""At the Fair"" is lots of fun.This is ""some terrific, radiant, humble"" movie that presents the best of old school cartoon animation. A sweet story of friendship, love, loyalty, and other positive elements. It's being remade as a live action movie, and I'm not certain how that'll translate from animation; but this original version is recommended for fine family viewing. far as animation goes, Charlotte's Web proves once again that it's all about story; the most beautiful animation in the world can't save a lousy story...no matter what. And I highly doubt that the new live action version coming out will be half as charming as this animated classic. I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong...but I doubt it. and wise, Wilber is naive and friendly, and Templeton provides the perfect foil as a spoiled rat who's just in it for himself. Agnes Moorehead as the goose became a sort of comedic extra to make the little ones laugh in the face of the rather adult plot about life and death. Overall, it's a movie for the whole family. all are reminded of her ""magic"" when her little baby spiders hatch and go on into the world to live their lives.Debbie Reynold lends her voice to Charlotte, and several beautiful songs envelop this delightful story. This one is right up there with animated Disney Classics, a film every child should enjoy, one of the very best in its class. still find this movie very enjoyable.  It's not deep, it's not profound, it's a piece of mindless fluff, with some very nice performances from the voice actors and a lot of very cute moments.  It's children's fare, folks, so just take it as such, and it's a lot easier to take.  I liked it.  So there. "	6.9	0
Watership Down (1978)	"Mostel DOES have fun with the voice). Also, at the end, it gets very violent and quite bloody. When I saw it in a theatre in 1978 one small kid was in tears by the conclusion. So, use your own judgment but I would never let a small kid see this. This is perfect for teenagers and adults. A 10. to recommend it and not once, not once, have I heard anything but thanks for the suggestion. Most of them end up owning the film. Both symbolic and blunt, ""Watership Down"" is a triumph of emotional proportions and is exemplary of what adaptations, animation, scoring and good film-making should be about. This wonderful adventure is an asset to any collection...10/10. and the visual horror (Fivel seeing the field covered in blood, Holly's description of the warren blocked with dead bodies) is surely at least PG? Hmmm....To conclude it can be said that watching films from your childhood is often a bad move....they are usually best left in the memory. The same can not be said of Watership Down. Simply brilliant! that we must shield our children from anything that hints of the injustices that may exist in the real world. In fact, seeing a film such as this may help them in dealing with issues in their own lives or perhaps teach them lessons in understanding and appreciation of the world around them. Watership Down had that effect on me. screen. 'Watership Down' is among them. It is a magnificently gripping adventurous tale. After 30 years it still remains a powerful story that strongly applies to today's world. I remember seeing it ages ago and then it was a must-have-on-DVD movie for me. I finally got the DVD and had the pleasure to watch revisit it today. A dazzling gem. "	7.7	1
American Tail, An (1986)	the ending that much more satisfying, an infinitely more significant and authentic moment than any cardboard cut-out Disney plot.If you want to see what animation was meant to be as an art form, if you want to feel the power and emotion that can truly be reaped from this under-appreciated and over-commercialized medium, look no further than An American Tail. And the film is such a wonder to behold, even after all these years. Despite another sequel and one (or was that 2?) (one was made in 1999 and it's coming soon to video?) direct to video movies. Out of the three I've seen, this one is still the best, and it's among my favorite animated movies of all time perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie for all ages that will warm your heart to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. No matter how predictable or sentimental the story is, I always get caught up in it. The sequel was good, but it was more like a fast-paced western comedy with some one-liners and such sight gags. The original is the better film in my opinion. Only complaint: one too many chase scenes with Fievel and other mice running from cats. well as the wonderfulsong 'Somewhere Out There' which has since become my favourite duet of alltime (I've even sung the end-credits version, as sung by Linda Ronstadt andJames Ingram, on Karaoke!).  Some adults may not like the sentimentality, but stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with a gem, particularly if watching with either the young or the young-at-heart. 	6.9	0
American Tail: Fievel Goes West, An (1991)	certainly does the original justice. Yes, it does lack the heart of the original, but having less heart than An American Tail does in no way mean being heartless. Don Bluth might not have had a hand in this, but Fievel Goes West lives up to Bluth's classic story of a little mouse called Fievel.Animation-9/10; Story-7/10; Plot-7/10; Comedy-8.5/10 = Overall-8/10 action, romance, adventure, and gun slinging. The music was really good. I loved every minute of this movie. I'm a big fan. I've loved this movie since I was in 1st grade,( thats when it came out into theaters). I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good cartoon movie. This one is a classic. You wont be disappointed. more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it. As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for. will become an instant classic in your collection. It can be passed down from generation to generation. Granted, this isn't a movie that will be watched late at night by you and your buddies. This movie does what it's supposed to do, entertain the little ones. Your children will have you rewinding over and over again (thank God for DVD's!). a treat, just like the original.All real complaints come from the writing, there are small plot holes, a pointless subplot revolving around Feival's sister Tanya, and sometimes the plot seems a little too convenient.Kids will probably like the film, fans of the original may or may not, I personally rate it lower than the original, but by not too much. 	6.5	0
Legend (1985)	and the sets are breathtaking, literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed - a huge fantasy forest - was built for this movie.If you haven't seen this version, rent it. If you have kids, buy it for them; they'll watch it over and over. My daughter and her friends watch it repeatedly, she's probably seen it 50 times. children could relate to and even enjoy but it is a far deeper film with a host of reflective ideas and quite magical concepts. What really IS the Lord of Darkness? What is the significance of the Unicorns? What becomes of the innocence we leave behind in childhood? If none of this interests you, make sure you avoid this film! could a fantasy film deliver, and a a bonus the plaintive voice of YES front man Jon Anderson singing the song over the final credits. I am sorry that there so many people that were not mature enough to enjoy the artistry of this film. I would still like to get the DVD version to see the cut I missed. about or you see it as something deeper that it doesn't pretend to be. It's much purer in it's view on good vs evil and to my taste it hits on every level of that platform. And not to mention it's ability to make for a great dream filled with hope and danger.Pure fantasy...and should be viewed with that intent. Jerry Goldsmith .The European cut is better in that it is longer and it features Jerry Goldsmith's score .The best version however is the Director's Cut featured on The Ultimate Edition DVD . It runs alot longer than any of the other cuts and it is the most coherent cut as well and it features the score by Jerry Goldsmith. 	6.5	0
Sixteen Candles (1984)	"(Jake)....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12 - 112. Very clever and very funny. teen-angst comedies of the era feature tissue-thin parental figures.  This was the first and best of the so-called ""brat pack"" movies, and will always hold a place in 1980's filmmaking history.  Girls learned never to lend their underwear to a geek and we all learned that high school is just a phase, easily forgotten as time goes on. That is so OLD.""  But that's what I like about it. If you want to watch a film that reflects the eighties, forget the nostalgia trips of The Wedding Singer and Romy and Michelle.  Hire a true eighties product, such as Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire.... The list goes on and on. Club"", this is the best of the John Hughes 1980's movies.  The acting is perfection, down to the smallest parts, too.  Standouts are Blanche Baker as the bride-to-be on too many painkillers, Justin Henry as the pain-in-the-neck little brother, Michael Schoeffling as hunk-deluxe Jake Ryan and last but never least, Anthony Michael Hall as Farmer Fred....I mean Ted. the trials and tribulations of high school.The film is well-paced, never drags, and has its characters pegged pretty well. The obnoxious grandparents are particularly well-drawn. Of course things are eventually resolved in a manner that could never possibly happen in real life, but that's why we go to the movies.I miss those destructive house parties!!! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Pretty in Pink (1986)	Spader was such a realistic jerk, you want to get up and punch his face in. Harry Dean Stanton and Annie Potts play the adult roles of substance. Have you ever seen Stanton so sympathetic? A very upbeat soundtrack keeps the movie flowing and helps you feel the atmosphere. Don't write this off as just another teen movie. Highly recommended. perfect for someone, that someone wants the perfection of someone else.  And that sucks, love's a bitch Duck.  Love's a bitch.Pretty In Pink epitomizes everything that made the 80's a great time for teen flicks.  Secret loves, proms, a great soundtrack and John Hughes. What more can you ask for?  This is one of the best. director, even though his area of expertise was '80s teen movies--but, let's face it, no one could have done them better.To wrap it up, PRETTY IN PINK is a cute love story with fantastic acting and characters that manages to capture a bit of the true essence of love, even if it is a bit disappointing in the end. 7/10. The Dark). While the end has a hard time getting things straight, there is a valuable moment that caresses deeply. From start to finish, this one still holds up against the recent string of teen pictures that aren't as cool or refreshing (CLUELESS and REALITY BITES are the exceptions). A movie like this is great when it's not so raunchy. classic films.  I also loved the fact that you got to see some later on famous stars appear in this film like Kristy Swanson and Gina Gershon.  Neither really had any lines but they were in it.  Make sure to see this movie if you get a chance.  Romance or not, it is a good film. 	6.8	0

Your friends will always be there for you, through thick and thin, however, as you grow older, the roles each play in your life changes. Getting older doesn't mean severing ties to the past, but instead a restructuring of it to keep you strong and moving towards the future. she says as she works as a social worker, still trying to have an affect.Similar to the later Generation X issues, and the now sense of alienation, everyone goes through similar growing pains, whether 80's materialism, 90's nihilism ('Reality Bites') or today's general alienation and violence. The issues are the same, the culture just manifests them a bit differently. 8/10 trailers for About Last Night and Mortal Thoughts) if it had been toned down. There's the prostitute and the Jews, as well, I suppose. The acting tends to be spot-on. There is a bit of sexuality(not graphic, only brief nudity) and strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone looking for pictures about the troubles of growing up. 6/10 its flaws is it makes me put my life in perspective and think about the friends and decisions I have made.

Ayla endures many trials throughout the movie in order to gain their trust and approval, which ultimately prepare her for a journey into the world without the Clan.A movie worth watching again and again.  The book is great also, by the way, so I recommend them both. who want a stone age comedy-romance, ""Caveman"", or a special effects absurdity of prehistoric people fighting lots of dinosaurs, ""One Million BC"", (which is historically impossible). But if you can appreciate an intense story of a young woman's survival in the wild and her experience with a lost stone age culture, then I recommend ""Clan of the Cave Bear"". 9/10 format.The whole film is about acceptance of someone different and of change. This is a common theme in many many films over the years, and is closely related to the popular ""Pleasantville"" of 1998. What makes this one different and enjoyable is the setting in time, the depiction of community values of these prehistoric peoples. I rate it highly overall. "	5.4	0

There is some grain during darker scenes but other than this the movie is looking great.The Mono soundtrack is not terribly engaging and most of the film's sound is centre-channel biased.

House II deserves more respect than it gets because it's a good horror/comedy (which is rare)...and your kids can enjoy it too.Note for genre buffs: Kane Hodder was the stunt coordinator for House II and did a cameo as the gorilla guy. Dwier Brown, who plays Clarence, appeared in the first House as the Lieutenant in the Vietnam scenes. as a smarmy record exec. Watch out for some imaginative special effects that bring to mind the work of Ray Harryhausen (like the skeletal horse ridden by Royal Dano's nemesis) and the super cute caterpuppy! If every scene doesn't work it hardly matters as it is always an enjoyable and wild ride. Watch this for a dose of imaginative fun. worth  watching! 	5.4	0

I think I prefer the score in this film, also.Part II is funny, but the tone isn't quite as ""madcap"", and there isn't quite as much slapstick (although there still is plenty to be had) as Part I. However, this is still a more than worthwhile sequel to a masterpiece. The kids are charming, and the female lead is a wonderful physical comedienne.

The ending is a bit sappy, but it still doesn't detract from a very sweet story with characters you can actually cheer for (except, of course for Moody and Mike, but it was fun booing them as well). am slightly disappointed with the editing; they appear to be going for dramatic pauses that don't work well and slow the pace of the scenes at times.  However, I'm willing to live with that for the opportunity to see this wonderful story, which after 24 years still rings true to the reality of the cutthroat world of high school. been bullied will squirm in their seat after watching him for just ten minutes.

THIS movie than good. I don't see how it's THAT bad to most viewers. It is one of my top favorites. It contains an excellent blend of comedy and drama about life in a rural American location (no mention of state or town but Texas is a good possibility). Great character acting.

While not up to the level of films of the same era made by people like John Hughes, The Allnighter is worth a look once, more if you like and/or remember the Bangles. I saw this movie when I was a teenager, about 15 years ago and loved every second of it, even watched it more than once! Maybe you don't need any brains to understand this movie but must life always be so serious? It most certainly is NOT boring, just watch it with a big bag of popcorn and have fun! smile once or twice, but I doubt you will even chuckle at any of these misadventures.  The film is basically just a dull, overlong, snoozefest. The acting is alright, not really good, but nothing terrible.  The soundtrack is decent as well.  Unless you are a fan of Susanna Hoffs, leave this one alone. * out of **** the way with a great supporting cast of CJ and Killer, the girls find out just what is in store for them. A great soundtrack, too bad it is not available.  I promise you that when you watch this you will be taken back to a time in your life before you really knew what life was actually like. Sometimes the dialog proves hilariously awful in this silly mess of a film. Pam Grier, who is much too talented to be appearing in this forgettable teenage comedy romp, makes a short appearance as a lady officer. For a real Beach party film, one must look instead to the 1950s and the 1960s. Watch Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello instead. 	4.1	0

Stars and Bars (1988)	"(a tightly wound serious man), but in a very different universe from films like ""My Left Foot"" and ""The Age of Innocence"".  If you are hoping for another period piece or serious art, this film is not for you.  Luckily, I happen to like films that range from Wim Wenders to the latest Adam Sandler vehicle.  :) Both are hysterical weekends with people whose family trees ""don't branch!!""  You'll never see Lewis doing this whimsy again, except perhaps as the pansy boyfriend in ""Room with a View"" which he did at about the same time.  Both characters are played with equal artistic integrity he grants all his roles.  Kudos and many laughs to all! German translation cannot be that perfect. I guess that the linguistical misunderstandings between the ""hero"" (Day Lewis) and the bizarre Georgian family with Anglophobic slursare are ten times funnier in the original version (as they are in the book). Anyway, I liked the film immediately and I'm happy to have taped it. Great cast! Unforgettable: Maury Chaykin as Elvis-like Freeborn. as leading lady and love object is bizarre, too - up until this point she'd been relegated to kooky sidekick/friend of the heroine roles (Broadcast News springs immediately to mind), something she went back to almost immediately after this film. It's strange all around, but also a funny time capsule of sorts. I too wish it was out on DVD. Both are hysterical weekends with people whose family trees ""don't branch!!""

Married to the Mob (1988)	"real as he is hilarious. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me, this time, to the Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of ""Remember The Night"" I'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this Jonathan Demme gem. is not family fare with a deserved R-rating for language, violence and some nudity but it's not really a rough movie. It has its charms, that's for sure. Modine plays the nice guy ""Mike Downey.""Note: stay with the ending credits, because there is a lot of footage of scenes that never made it to the movie but were very interesting. Mercedes Ruehl and Dean Stockwell (as Tony 'The Tiger' Russo) are absolutely delicious.  The plot is delightful, and sometimes manages to touch on some more somber issues, as all great comedies do.In short, I've seen this hilarious film two or three times over the years, and thinking about it now makes me eager to watch it all over again! the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it off perfectly well.Charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? If you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story. If you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune to HBO's The Sopranos. all when he went on to win the Oscar for directing ""Silence of The Lambs."" The performances he evokes from his actors in ""Married"" are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.One of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80's, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.

Say Anything... (1989)	"understand their motivation, what drives them with carefully crafted scenes and dialogue.When the ending comes, it is the subtle way they foreshadow the future instead of the standard frantic pacing most romantic comedies have when it comes to a conclusion. That in itself pretty much sums up the beauty of the film.It is pure genius, this film is pure genius. out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one.  It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up.  This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love. feelings and moments that you can so easily identify with to make them just right, and seem so natural.It's a wonderfully written film, with equal acting, to remind us all of falling in love for the first time without all the hurt, mistrust and disbelief in oneself. It even manages to provide one of the best endings I've ever seen. one of the strongest pieces of romantic cinema.  Not only do John Cusack and Ione Skye have perfect chemistry; not only is John Mahoney's character one of the most complicated father figures in the history of film; not only is the screen play delightfully honest; but everything just seems to fit right in this movie.  A true treasure it seems impossible not to root for Cusack, particularly the iconic scene forever cemented in teen movie history in which Lloyd stands outside of Diane's house next to his car, holding a boom box over his head and blasting Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" with a look of desperate heartache and lost pride on his face. An iconic date movie. "	7.4	0
My Blue Heaven (1990)	"my opinion Steve Martin's most under-rated film, in which he plays an Italian gangster put on a witness protection programme as he awaits to go to court. Martin was born to play this part, and his character's cocky swagger had me laughing every time he appeared! Rick Moranis also stars, and is his usual nerdy self, which is funny enough! likable and Cusack's ""Hannah Stubbs"" is overly silly.The language is very tame, especially for a PG-13 film. It's just a nice lighthearted comedy, worth a look or two. I saw it three times and by then, that was enough. The DVD version I saw wasn't a whole lot better than the tape with poor surround sound and a so-so transfer. the silent film style ""captions, or whatever you would call them a lot. They added humor to the movie.In summary, I found the movie very light, very entertaining, and cute. I like that type of movie. If you want something that requires no thought, where your goal as a viewer is just to relax and be amused, this is perfect. predictable, but it is a very adorable movie that I think any Steve Martin fan could appreciate. The cast was great and the story was very funny, I thought it was so cool that it was slightly based on Henry Hill's(who you probably remember from Goodfellas) life. Rick and Steve are just great and I think you'll enjoy this movie.6/10 who tries to protect Martin from mafia hitmen and more dangerously himself. Joan Cusack is priceless as a local district attorney who wants to get Martin for every little offense he commits while awaiting his court date to testify. William Hickey is also good as one of Martin's shady friends. A good little film overall. 3.5 out of 5 stars. "	6.2	0
Men Don't Leave (1990)	"is such a sense of hope, generosity and goodness in this movie.  It is not at all maudlin, or contrived.

There are also great comedic moments, chiefly involving O'Donnell and Cusack.  See this movie! script with Barbara Benedek (THE BIG CHILL). Thomas Newman's spare, haunting score reveals why he's one of the finest film composers working today.Also, despite other user comments, this is not a 'tearjerker.'

Highly recommended. joyful and heartbreakingly sad and features sure-handed direction by Paul Brickman and a beautiful score by Thomas Newman who also scored ""American Beauty"".

Finally, the excellent song played over the end credits is ""Heart Of A Hero"", written and performed by Luther Vandross. It not only examines fragile human issues like family responsibility, love, our stigmas that we set upon heroes and morality, but it is a damn entertaining movie.  It is also a tearjerker.

He is my hero for remaining true to himself--as flawed as that is. No, this ain't Disney--it's Dustin, at his finest. The movie has humour, pathos and some great lines. One of my favourites. require a degree in theater to like the film.

This movie is more ""Mulholland Drive"" than ""Willie Wonka.""Whether you will like this movie depends entirely on how your mind works. Poets will probably love it. Engineers will probably hate it. that is expressed very openly in the entire premise of a General taking control of a toy company and turning it to military purpose.Any who would dismiss this film as merely childish surely owe it to themselves to take another look at this surrealist masterpiece and lose themselves in the quirky visuals and creative world that is placed on screen. allowing yourself to be a child is the perfect remedy to adulthood. Maybe THAT'S what a lot of people don't understand about this movie.  Nice Job, Barry.Ten stars and a smoking jacket for ""Toys"", the movie that proves there's a time and a place for children's things, as long as you don't let growing up spoil it for you. personality. Overall, this movie will either move you or it wont. If you are someone who only likes big Hollywood movies then you probably wont enjoy this film.

The performances are pretty good and there is a great high school/teenage ambiance about the film.

Truly riveting! try to keep that from happening. Carafotes did a fine job, as did Val Avery (coach), Victor French (father), and Pat Buttram (Pops). John's father and coach fought for his rights. Pops, even though the proprietor of an establishment where rough teens hang out, provided good, solid advice. John is very fortunate to have such caring people in his life. and his Academy Award nominated Georgy Girl co-director Silvio Narizzano did a glowing job with the little resources they had on hand making the film look much bigger than the money it was produced for. I highly recommend it as an inspirational, never give up in face of obstacles type film for all families, and in particular high school students. this right from the start of the film. There is a low rating on this film for a reason - it's just to boring. I realize that teens will get upset at the weirdest things -- especially if they can't play football anymore but to (almost) fall into a bad crowd over it and get huffy is way out there.1/10 	4.7	0

After this, he went on to make Pretty Woman, the Runaway Bride, and Frankie & Johnny, all of which are decent films.  Of course he also directed Exit to Eden (Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd in bondage-wear?  OUCH!) but we'll forgive him for that... orphans, little people, egotistic surgeons, stroke victims with pointy tongues, balloon pregnancies (my personal favorite), (un?)requited transsexual love, nurses with pharmacy keys up for grabs, latino rumbra seducers, even vanilla ice cream.

Guaranteed. a roll call as well, which is nice. While ""Young Doctors in Love"" doesn't set off any real comedy fireworks, it's still not bad at all, and does present a respectable effort to go for a certain zaniness, even if it's not on the level of a ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", or ""Naked Gun"".

The world was going to come to and end in '92, well that was '83 thinking anyway. There's no end to the fury of bad films you love being promoted to DVD. This one of them. but Parasite had one of the better ones. (Most of the other good 3D moments are in House of Wax with Vincent Price. Even Hitchcock couldn't figure out what to do with the gimmick.)By the way, in 1982 no one had ever heard of Demi Moore. Did we predict big things for her after seeing her in this? Yeah, right. it in 3D. you don't need the glasses to see it, so I would say that it is properly not in true 3D.

Reportedly, there were plans to produce an inevitable sequel back in the early 80's, simply titled PARASITE II.

Robert Glaudini, Luca Bercovici, Al Fann, James Davidson, Cherrie Currie and a quick show-in by Cheryl Smith. Demi Moore in her first on-screen role doesn't make much of a dent, but it's far from awful.In the end it's immensely forgettable, but lately watching these modern (and sometimes leaden) Sci-fi original TV features is making me appreciate this schlock far more. 	3.6	0

It captures that early eighties feel well. And broaches the subject of a teenage temptress more honestly than the recent version of Lolita.I can only think that this movie was out of time. probably from a gentler age, but it still hits the mark with me, even watching it now. I was like 19 so wipe the perverted sanctimonious smirk off of your face! I like good comedy and well made on location vacation pics, that inspire me to travel. So it's the Peters-Gelbart script and the wonderful scenery that have won it a place in my cold heart. Ok, ok, topless 18 year old girls are a decided bonus. these things!But it does have the type of storyline and pointless nudity that Hollywood seems unwilling to include in a mainstream film. This is one of those movies that was on HBO late at night when I was a kid and I loved it. There's something to great nudity! We just don't celebrate it enough anymore! Plus Demi Moore pre-implants! native music of his location while keeping everything as light and fizzy as a tropical drink.

Colorful cinematography full of shades and lights by excellent Spanish cameraman Juan Ruiz Anchia (Close range, House of game , River runs black) . The motion picture was well directed by Carl Schulz (usual television picture director) . It's one of the most unusual supernatural movie from the 80s and certainly one of the most unsettling . and is a highlight of his career. All religious paraphernalia aside though, the themes presented, about sacrifice, love, and finding the one tiny ray of hope in a world cluttered with scum and degenerates are concepts that can be universally applied to any story, be it Christian or not. It's a moody, exciting, heartfelt film that's well worth checking out. of the plot, I was also very moved, particularly by the ending.  Demi Moore was better than usual as the pregnant Abby, but it was certainly Jurgen Prochnow's performance as the strange boarder that Abby and her husband take into their home, that turned this into such an extraordinarily gripping and ultimately uplifting movie.

I'm not sure if writer Dan Akroyd intended this to be so nightmarish, but it sure is. Definitely a one-of-a-kind. NOT for young kids!! second character Dan was playing until the credits rolled. The sets are unreal- from the junkyard (complete with piles and PILES of random junk and the Baby Huey-esquire Lil' Debil and Bobo) to the house of the honorable judge, it's hard to believe they actually put this together.

Somehow, the characters portrayed in the movie seem strangely familiar, and this can even be unsettling (where have I seen them before?).

I find it to be a sweet, feel-good film with occasional hints at magic realism, but without plunging too far into that iffy genre.I feel that all the players did good jobs, and that the locations and settings felt very true. Nice production values too.If you like ""Moonstruck"", then you will probably like ""The Butcher's Wife"" too. also great, I don't know where this is in  NYC, but I would love to live there!  I think Jeff Daniels is simply brilliant in this film, and Mary  Steenbergen too. The scene where DM tells her she's a singer is lovely  & the sparky scenes between JD & DM are so sweet and funny too! apart thanks to the whacky Demi Moore character. Demi is perfect as the ditzy but charming butcher's wife. I really liked Mary Steenburgen in this story... she looked beautiful and sang like an angel. I liked all of the little characters too. The music at the end is haunting and perfect for the finale which wasn't surprising but who cares!!! fall in love. This only adds to the confusion in everyone's lives and doesn't help solve their problems.The movie isn't a first class romance but if accepted on its own terms it's very enjoyable with a message or two about life and understanding. I tune in to see it whenever it's on, might get the video too if funds permit. accuracy when it comes to predictions that don't involve her is a little far-fetched, especially when she gets her own life in such a mess.Worth a look if you like low-key romantic comedies with a slightly magical twist (not a large genre!), or if you liked ""Simply Irresistible"" (1999) with Sarah Michelle Gellar. Not really one for most guys, though. "	5.3	0
Mortal Thoughts (1991)	"and all while sitting in the same chair for most of the film! Glenne Headly shows just how good she is as Joyce goes from kooky and fun to paranoid and potentially dangerous. The ending manages to tie all the ends of the mystery up while grabbing at your emotions. Truly a satisfying film for a dark and stormy night. director Alan Rudolph (Breakfast of Champions, Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle). Moore and Willis (who went on to marry after reportedly meeting on this film) are particularly effective. Mortal Thoughts is made all the more memorable in that it constantly asks the viewer what he or she would do in the strenuous situations in which the characters find themselves. human abuse. This is a good film to show innocent women in this world, if you experience this type of behavior, run to the nearest police station and turn this guy in immediately. However, I must say that Bruce Willis did such a great acting job, you actually grew to hate him and the role he played. Good Film, Enjoy pack of lies, then the truth could be anything). The result is a film that is reasonably watchable, but hardly distinguished. Yet in the true story, revealed at the end, there's actually a tale of human drama that might have driven a pretty strong film. The secondary tale of someone merely lying about such a story, however, is comparatively dull. stories and make our choice about who was telling the truth.Bottom line: better than one might expect with a realistic edge clearly a notch or two above the usual thriller fare.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Few Good Men, A (1992)	"out of mind.  Like who is on that wall tonight, and are we safe because of him.  And it makes you reflect upon some things perhaps too often taken for granted.  And that's what really makes this film so good; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10. sucks you in from the opening minute. There is so much great dialogue, headlined by Tom Cruise's courtroom battle with Jack Nicholson at the movie's climax.Too many people say the movie is average because it's ""too slow,"" but I really believe anyone who appreciates good acting and good stories has to put this one near the top of their list. who commands respect and demands the best.With outstanding performances from Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, and Yes Demi Moore as well. The plot develops, and the conspiracy surrounding the case becomes apparent. And its up to Cruise to lay his career on the line to find the truth.This movie is a powerful drama, and is fantastically well made.I love it 10/10 think we do, but the movie is still exciting in its own way.I liked this movie very much, it was never boring, and I was real pleased that some of the cliches you normally see in a movie like this one were left out. If you like a good story, good directing and perfect performances this is your movie. 9/10. for Demi, I am still unable to figure her out.  What is it about her that remains stubbornly unsympathetic?  She has abundant intelligence and talent, and is exquisitely beautiful, and yet is is impossible to warm to her.  Does she get these parts because of her dark personality, or do the roles colour our perception of her? "	7.7	1
Indecent Proposal (1993)	"How far would you go to get some money? People will go the distance and sometimes take a front seat with the devil! ""Indecent Proposal"" goes all the way and shakes up human emotions. I really felt that this was a very good movie and should be watched. 5.3 is a little harsh, what was so bad about it? 8/10 only is made worse when you think of the potential it had to be a complex and insightful modern morally piece. Those happy with the substance and complexity of a slushy music video will enjoy it but the majority will leave it wondering what all the fuss was about and how such an interesting concept was so completely fouled up. was no danger, really. He allows himself to be Redford all the way. The indecency is in the title in the gimmick but not in the spirit. As a result none of the promises are fulfilled and we're left with a pretty inconsequential movie. Oh well, I hope Mr Lyne learned his lesson. One never bad mouths James Mason, okay? Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest... The script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. I suspect Redford, Moore, and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. Do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. Unless some one offers you a million... Miss It!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer 1980s with a couple of scenes that are a bit too pop video for my liking but despite not being the greatest actors in the history of cinema both Moore and Woody Harrelson do enough to make the audience feel for their characters who find themselves in a dilemma .

Permanent Midnight (1998)	"in this, believe it or not. 'Permanent Midnight' was, like so many other good movies that don't pander to a mass audience, a box office flop, but will hopefully find a larger audience in years to come via video and DVD. I think it is one of the most underrated movies of the last ten years, and highly recommend it. a cakewalk - and I mean you have to be clean before you can go through it, remains rather mysterious. Oh well, whatever, an interesting, entertaining movie that held my interest for its running time. Some usage scenes might be a bit upsetting to the non-anointed, although probably nothing quite so hard to take as in Requiem For A Dream. a bit of a stretch for both her acting talent and in the casting. But the rest of the cast does fine work. I think the major detriment to this movie is that the audience knows beforehand how it will all end. This is a very dramatic subject, but with no drama in the screenplay. And that is a drag. you want to see a movie that portrays the life-style associated with drugs accurately, watch this movie. loads of attention for getting his ""package"" caught in his zipper in ""There's Something About Mary"" (which is a very funny moive) hardly an eye was blinked when he gave the performance of his career in ""Midnight."" I think this film proves the theory that often comedic actors give the best dramatic performances. Do yourself a favor and rent it. "	6.3	0
One True Thing (1998)	"not perfect people. (Arguably, one might not say that about the ""Martha Stewart""-type character Streep plays but throughout the film, I found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. She's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) ""One True Thing"" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned. so much more. What she brings to this role is truly magical; the woman is a genius. How she could have missed out on the Oscar that year, I have absolutely no idea.There isn't much more to say, except for SEE THIS FILM. It is all at once extremely insightful, moving, humorous and beautiful. You won't regret watching this one. a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I will say that I have have never EVER cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. I implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is... love. she feels at her increasing debilitation. In a way, watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ""Ordinary People,"" although this movie was far less emotionally intense. So, not ""uplifting and humorous"" (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the DVD jacket) but very good in its own way. 7/10 much harder time.  I believe the three of them (Hurt, Streep and Zellweger) portrayed a real family story, something far from the typical Hollywood drama.  They were able to show the strong and weak sides of being human and bearing family responsibilities.  Very beautiful movie, very descriptive with several not-so-long scenes.  Indeed, sometimes less..is invariably more. "	7.0	0
Rush Hour (1998)	"And fortunately, the movie brings us out there. Interesting cultures melt into a huge variety of ethnicities that make anything possible to happen. This is why America is so interesting and wonderful and we from abroad love her as a beautiful land.All in all, this is a worth-seeing Hollywood movie and probably you would like to watch it several times! where Lee plays ""War"" by Edwin Starr in Carter's car, and he doesn't know how to say the lyrics correctly, and Carter shows him some moves, it was such a classic scene that brought me down to the floor laughing. I highly recommend Rush Hour, it's all in good fun and it'll give you more than a few good laughs.8/10 very hard time cooperating.I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously; just accept them as completely crazy. With Chan doing his martial arts and Tucker being a loudmouth, it's a great time from start to finish. Also starring Elizabeth Pena, Chris Penn, and Tom Wilkinson. I liked the sequel equally. Movie. I have seen a few Chris Tucker movie, this is his Best performance. I hope the third in the series will entertain as the First. If you have not seen this movie, then i recommend this movie. A great action comedy movie for all type of audience to enjoy. One of the best cop buddy movies since Lethal Weapon. moves by Tucker, but nobody impresses the audience like Jackie Chan leaping from place to place, mowing down the bad guys! RUSH HOUR is fantastic fun! A must-see for die hard action enthusiasts. This film is Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's finest hour.  Watch for the requisite funny outtakes by the film's end credits. RATING: *** out of ****. "	7.0	0
Lilian's Story (1995)	"decidedly un-Hollywood influenced approach. There are good characterisations and some nice symbolic touches such as the fridge weeping onto the kitchen floor as Lilian recalls her mother and the cruelty of her father.VHS copies can be obtained from ScreenSound Australia as I found difficulty in tracking this film down in the UK although it was distributed by Video Networks UK. worked for me as i could connect with her as to why she may have ended up so scared and alone. I recommend this film if u want to see Toni Collettes earlier work and it is one of Ruth Cracknells final films and the haunting lines she utters still ring now! Not a masterpiece but a fine Australian production. is quite good), there is little good to be said of this film. I'm not sure if it was the incoherent flash backs, or the real ""Aussie"" acting, that most had me reaching for the remote control.So, unless you are a big Ruth Cracknell fan and can stand the tedium this film has to offer, it is, unfortunately, best forgotten. an hour into the film. Incidentally, the character of Lillian is meant to be really plump as a child and later as a woman.......if the main character doesn't even resemble a novel's description, what chance does the film have? You might just as well cast Tori Spelling to play the Queen Mother...or even worse, Mick Jagger as Ned Kelly :) "	6.8	0
Six-String Samurai (1998)	"Petty & Slash) and his archer henchmen. Our Hero slashes his way through one unbelievable fight scene after another. Falcon is truly amazing. The fight choreography alone is reason enough to watch this peculiar piece of cinema.  The climax is a duel between our Hero(Rock-n-Roll) and Death(Heavy Metal).  Who becomes the King?  Watch it & love it. area, I'm familiar with most of the scenes featured (The bombed out gas station is the ghost town of Rhyolite, Nevada), so it was a kick seeing some of those places in a film.It isn't for everyone, and some will dislike it, mostly for it's campiness, but this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously...and neither should you. a successor. Accompanying him is a stereotypical post-apocalyptic bleating child snatched right out of ""Fistful of Dollars"". Buddy slices and dices his way through an evil bowling team, the Russian army, would-be usurpers to the throne, and anyone else who gets in his way. The music is good and it's wonderfully filmed, so have some fun and enjoy the ride. else since.  This movie was incredible for an otherwise unknown martial arts bit actor who also wrote the script and coordinated all the fighting.It would be cool if there was a sequel, or better yet, a prequel to 'Six-String'.  I for one would love to see a movie about King Elvis in Lost Vegas.9/10.  Very highly recommended. of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences of all time; I'd recommend it to anyone with an open mind about movies. "	6.7	0
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, A (1998)	"life of a family--and in a real family, few events from the past bear relevance to those of the present.  ""A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries"" simply seeks to discuss the development of relationships in a family;  events of high caliber are discussed thoroughly, while those of less importance portray to be all that they could ever be: memories. At first I was bothered by the lack of reference to Vietnam- then I realized neither Billy nor Channe would be that affected like those of us who lived through that period.  Most of all, Soldier's Daughter moved me to thinking how parents really influence their children. Any movie that foregoes bombs for thought is tops in my book. the movie is fine in the sense that it is intelligently written. Not only is it based on a novel but it feels as if it WAS a novel rather than a movie. The family is portrayed quite realistically. Even though the film does not seem to try to be artistic, it is lyrical enough to be seen as art. though.Actually, it is a film that is bound to be enjoyed if seen in a special mood. I'm lucky that I had that mood when it was showing on TV. Also it is a film that grows wonderfully with time, segment after segment. It's a really good coming-of-age story that should be considered as Ivory's one of the best works. his movie was one of the best that I have ever seen! It is one of the few foreign/drama films that has not bored me. It seemed like the movie would never end, but it was so brilliant I didn't want it to end. I have not watched a drama so good since Terms of Endearment. I highly recommend it. "	6.9	0
Somewhere in the City (1998)	out an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo appearance by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the revolutionary momma's boy, Somewhere in the City entertains without missing a beat. Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in American films these days. Writer/director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended! at there best. If you want a simple, cute story however, you won't find it here. The related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.  The main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch. same country let alone in the same movie, ranging from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here  !An added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is John Cale's soundtrack. 	4.2	0
Ronin (1998)	"anything that comes even halfway close. If you're sick of action flicks, or films in general, where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information, then Ronin is the cure.It may sound like a bizarre comparison, but it's on par with Lost Highway, as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time. still enjoyable for fans of the genre. Then there are the characters who much more real as they don't snap wise cracks while shooting bad guys square in the head one handed with a pistol at 30 yards. All in all, this is a very good entry in the action genre and Hollywood should take note. 8/10Rated R for violence the car chases.  These are shot magnificently as Peugeot's, BMW's and Audi's tear through the streets of Paris.  These chases are the most thrilling chases I have ever seen.  And when you get chases, you get crashes.  Think on-coming traffic chases and you might get the picture.This is a must see film. 8 out of 10. the conservation that Sam (De Niro) and Jean-Pierre (Lonsdale) have over the Ronin myth.  I'll have to admit that ""Ronin"" is the first film that I have seen was made by the crafty veteran director John Frankenheimer (""Grand Prix"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"").   If you haven't seen ""Ronin"", go to a video store and rent the movie now. atmosphere. As I said before Robert De Niro and Jean Reno were exceptional particularly in their scenes together. The support cast are good too with a brief but excellent display from Sean Bean and Natasha Mchelhone and Jonathan Pryce are both good as Irish terrosists with comendable accents. All in all a very god way to spend a few hours. "	7.3	0
Urban Legend (1998)	"encounter with the rampaging maniac), and there's a brief appearance by Danielle Harris, the former child star of HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (1988) and HALLOWEEN 5 (1989), playing an adult character FAR removed from the angelic poppet of those earlier pictures! Beautiful, fairy-tale score by Christopher Young. Followed by the largely unrelated URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT (2000). probably does the best acting job of all, especially at the end.Most all of the characters are boring and flat, aside from the main one. Many are simply there to get killed, and some that are more important are not as interesting. Still, this movie is better than I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and probably worth a rent. is so well disguised that it caught me out (even though I usually figure out whodunnit in films of this type). Urban Legend is no classic, nor is it particularly fresh, but it does what it does decently enough. It certainly beats the hell out of the excrutiating low-budget exploitation items from the early '80s upon which it is based. give up who the ""bad guy"" really is? The first true scary movie for me was Halloween when I was 13 years old. This one is no Halloween, but it was able to make me jump at the right times. We all know about those Urban Legends, but do we really believe them? Enjoy this movie, don't pick it apart. and get over with this revenging mission instead of doing this wild carnage. So be warned: the last half hour is extremely disappointing. Thus, if you are a horror fan who wants an entertaining thriller Urban Legend is a good shot. Despite some letdowns Urban Legend is yet another landmark in 90's horror genre. URBAN LEGEND - 8 / 10 "	5.5	0
