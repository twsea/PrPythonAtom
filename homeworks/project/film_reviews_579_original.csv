Toy Story (1995)	"as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters. the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system....

Jumanji (1995)	"being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment! and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10 original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. "	6.9	0
Grumpier Old Men (1995)	"a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. legend is returned to it's base.Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says ""Holy moly"" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age.

Waiting to Exhale (1995)	"unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't ""tell this story"" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were.Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! "	5.8	0
Father of the Bride Part II (1995)	I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism. to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written.If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair.Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains.On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. 	6.0	0
Heat (1995)	want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur. who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry. makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made. movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.A real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time. and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass. 	8.2	1
Sabrina (1995)	"the) Moonlight"" and ""How Can I Remember?"", are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies, and I think ""Sabrina"" ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous, marvelous film! version of ""Sabrina"", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn ""Sabrina"".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role. great acting can define a relationship, this one between mother and son, for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford's tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack's mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman.""It was a lie, then it was a dream."" who wears the business-first character of the ""only surviving heart donor"" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!) the players are selected very well , each contributing mightily to the final effect! The director really knew what he was doing and keeps the movie going strong.. congratulations to all. I wish there were more works like this, and would really like to see another done with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in the title roles, oncemore!. Bravo! Bravo! "	6.3	0
Tom and Huck (1995)	scenes. The graveyard scene is well done. Injun Joe is threatening and murderous. The funeral scene is a disappointment. It needed to be milked a bit. Some of the peripheral characters could have been more developed. The conclusion works OK. However, it needed a dose of truth and believability to carry it through. See it, but don't expect a lot. Huck is an interesting enough film, but the transformation of Eric Schweig in his portrayal of Injun Joe compared to his characterization of Uncas in The Last of the Mohicans, is the most fascinating thing about it. In the body of his films, he seems to be able to alternate between utterly noble and utterly disgusting (e.g., Missing). Great acting. sugar-coated scenes and the fact that both Tom and Huck are a bit out-of-character, this movie is still something worth seeing. Injun Joe and Muff Potter are both realistic and Rachael Leigh Cook makes a brilliant and not-so-girly Becky Thatcher! The sets and wardrobe look very authentic, but they alone are not enough to bring the evergreen story wholly alive. of all time? Not that this is a bad film. As far as kid stories go, it is alright, and not the worst introduction to the world of Mark Twain. But it is clearly not intended to be a masterpiece, but more like something one might see on the Hallmark channel. Just a showcase for the now-forgotten Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Not to mention that Rachael Leigh Cook as Becky Thatcher is probably the worst case of miscasting in this movie; she was way too old and was a good two heads taller than Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Disney could have made their own version of Tom Sawyer great, especially with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the lead. What a wasted, missed opportunity. 	5.6	0
Sudden Death (1995)	"the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. ""Sudden Death"" has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won't care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn't. I'll never understand why.***1/2 (out of four) through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn't it?The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I'm undecided if ""Sudden Death"" would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer's ""Black Sunday"".  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It's a straight crime story.One note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version. Boothe. He was extremely convincing as ""the bad guy"". The movie at times is a little far fetched..but most movies are.  I also thought it was very cool how Jean-Claude's character used lots of odd objects to create weapons(Fire extinguisher, tube and darts)..anyway if your looking for a good action movie to watch, Sudden Death should be your choice. be one of the best movies of all time in it's genre. This movie - Sudden Death - is his best action film.Great action scenes, some very hilarious scenes, and great overall action and suspense make this a great action movie overall.If you like action movies, you'll love this one. If you are a Van-Damme fan, this is a must-see.9/10 "	5.7	0
GoldenEye (1995)	"produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it. as an extra at the Chemin De Fer table at Monte Carlo's gambling casino; she's the daughter of Eunice Gayson, who played Bond's fetching girlfriend, Sylvia Trench in the first two Bond films, ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love."" It was to Sylvia Trench that Sean Connery uttered his first line of dialog, ""I admire your luck, Mr. ...?"" briefing and some commands.  Brosnan more than holds his own against past Bonds, and offers some of that GQ gentlemen element found missing in some of the past ones.  Bond fan, action fan, any fan, check this one out.  I even made my girlfriend watch it, and even she enjoyed it.  Chances are you will too. in my opinion, and ties all the classic 007 elements together flawlessly. Although adhering to the Bond foundations, this film has a great, fresh feel to it, I think partly due to the industrial style score by Eric Serra. I think you need to see this film more than once to fully appreciate it, but it is definitely a classic! has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs (what a way to go!) Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun. "	7.2	0
American President, The (1995)	"look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own. I enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most ""romantic"" settings in the world - The White House. makes you jealous as always, J. Fox never misses an opportunity to display huge talent and Dreyfuss is just the kind of guy you love to hate. Add a dose of victorious political correctness and top it of with a final speech that raises the hair on any kinds of neck but rednecks, and you got your evening made.Enjoy ! interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting. particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country's Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally, I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I'm not even American! Whatever the nation involved, pity we don't have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today. to none.  Just fabulous. "	6.8	0
Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)	"engaged couple who after 10 years have suddenly held hands being condemned as immoral, prostitutes, lechers and the like. Into these cultural and successful observations Brook's introduces Leslie Nielson doing a great impression of Bela Lugosi's Dracula with the difference that his powers are incompetent.Seeing the Lugosi movie will give you the basis to appreciate the sophistication of this film. ""Oh.  Give him an enima.""As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.FOOSH-TAA!""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" gets 9 of 10 stars Leslie Neilson did a great job in the role of Dracula, and his Renfield, Peter MacNichol, was a superb performance.This movie deserves full credit for its level of parodistic comedy, even if it is lost on viewers.  If you can't stand this movie, or find it unentertaining, then maybe you don't understand its roots well enough to appreciate it. story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for ""Love At First Bite"" which was similar in laughs to this.

Balto (1995)	"of the movie. It especially sounds great when you're supporting surround sound.This movie was a great movie and people think it was one of the greatest letdowns in the 1990's. In my opinion, it was the greatest animated movie and I would recommend that you should watch it with your family or with a friend. It is a fantastic movie... to do. You will enjoy this film greatly. After viewing it once, you will want to see it again. I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. But it has been more than thirty times. See this movie. It's well worth seeing. This one is one that I am proud to have in my video collection.....5/5. of the Balto statue in Central Park) which acts as a tie-together, and the true story behind this movie gives it additional appeal. This film, like the WB's 'Iron Giant', has been breezed over by the public and not gotten the recognition it deserves. I would recommend Balto for anyone who likes dogs, realism, or just a smooth, enjoyable film. DVD! This movie teaches a wonderful lesson. And is just a wonderful true movie!If you can get this movie for your children. They will enjoy it for years to come, as will you!And i really don't need 10 lines to explain to you how good this movie is. When you get the chance to watch it, that will be enough. that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look.  It's actually one of the best underrated animated films of the 90's.  The drama is real, the visuals are beautiful, and the story ends happily.  The live action prologue and epilogue are a little distracting, but they're made up for by a random (and hilarious) visual shout-out to ""E.T."" "	7.1	0
Nixon (1995)	"ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone, so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone's film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward arms-extended, double V-sign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion. in '64?""A truly fascinating portrayal of a fascinating man, even in the end somewhat sympathetic to Nixon as the film ends with his 1994 funeral service, some comments at that service by President Clinton and a summary of his career by a narrator pointing out his accomplishments. A last note: kudos to Paul Sorvino, who hit Henry Kissinger bang on.8/10 first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story. on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well? Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon. "	7.1	0
Cutthroat Island (1995)	"just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects. In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean (which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods). a good story. The successful franchize ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an improvement of ""Cutthroat Island"" with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Ilha da Garganta Cortada"" (""The Cutthroat Island"") who played Elizabeth Swann in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - and to have Geena walloping Keira's waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank ""Dracula/Skeletor"" Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else, rent it for the expensive sets, fancy costumes, and elaborate, over the top stunts - many of which Davis and Modine did themselves. Shaw (Matthew Modine). If you enjoy Seventeenth Century pirate movies, and like to see how 92 million dollars were spent in sea-battles, rope-swinging, slow motion swashbuckling action, cannons with many explosions and many fires, plenty of rum, cove and cliffs, lots of treasure, the destruction of two Jamaican towns, gorgeous ocean vistas and breathtaking visuals ... don't miss this one! Davis is rather engaging as a female pirate and Frank Langella seemed to be enjoying himself.  Most people will say that this movie can't hold a candle to the pirate films of Errol Flynn, and they're right.  But for a rock em sock em pirate adventure with more explosions than the high seas ever saw, watch Cutthroat Island. "	5.6	0
Casino (1995)	"gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come. Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem. clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening... They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story... 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy... And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic... have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences). check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly "	8.2	1
Sense and Sensibility (1995)	"the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it's bumped 'Raging Bull' off my personal top 10 list. Lee's direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson's script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma. All in all, this is excellent. but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film, for the story, the wit, the period and the imagery. opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making. I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish.

Four Rooms (1995)	"entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day, it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet. especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize's misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won't regret seeing it. types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation. his visual storytelling.  It's low-rent Tarantino, don't get me wrong, but it's also the best part of ""Four Rooms.""All in all, the first film I've ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just don't make me watch it again. Soup, all from the 92 Sundance place), they did whatever they wanted, and it's not the success it could've been.

His work is done.When this ""Nature"" calls, answer it.Nine stars.  And remember: do not pass go, do not collect $200. that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it's Ace's love for animals that comes out quite well.

Money Train (1995)	remarkable when it first came out, but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly entertaining and well executed. Granted, it's not the best film ever but I don't think it's deserving of a lot of the bad reviews given here.As a film it succeeds, and if you've never seen it before, it's worth checking out. she is in real life. I really don't know where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You might like it but not because it's quality stuff but because it'll cheer you up, it's so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I'll give it a full **** out of *****. role in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist.Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of its parts, and that's possibly the most frustrating thing of all. I don't want to be fussy and pick out several little pieces and analyse them , this film was a simple time killing pop-corn movie that should viewed when you don't feel like watching something heavy or you'd rather check this out rather than Santa's Slay . MONEY TRAIN - 5.6 OUT 10 - THATS WHAT WE LIVE WITH . provides a real antagonism for the buddy/brother cops, and establishes himself as the real villain for the plot.The plan, and the execution of the robbery, (and Snipes character going along with something like this), REALLY stretches plausibility, but there is an easy camaraderie between the 2 actors, and the action is good.It ain't all that good, but it isn't unwatchable. 	5.6	0
Get Shorty (1995)	"ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A- its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood's unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there's plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, ""Be Cool"", wasn't quite as good, but still worth seeing. is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn't already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time. If I had enjoyed the film the first time, looking at it a second time was a revelation. the movie business. Before he can however, he must deal with bumbling mobsters, white-collar criminals, and the anxiety of trying to find the right leading man. Crackling, hilarious dialogue, well-drawn characters, and clever insight into the movie business run rampant in this snappy little comedy. Maybe not for all tastes, but well-made and a definite must for Travolta fans. *** especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (from 'The Addams Family'), knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it. Fortunately we have the actors and direction to make it even better and definitely more entertaining. "	6.9	0
Copycat (1995)	"deserve credit for a intelligent, well-researched screenplay. No clichés here, just sharply-crafted dialogue. And Christopher Young's inspired score is brilliant; just listen to the theme that plays early on, as Helen calms down after a panic attack.""Copyat"" may not be classic material, but it's a strong entry in a genre that's too often consumed by formulas and gore. Highly recommended. too soon and could be kept as a mystery; but anyway the character is not connected to Helen, Andy, M.J. or Reuben and it would not be possible to have a twist or a major surprise if the mystery was kept. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Copycat - A Vida Imita a Morte"" (""Copycat – The Life Imitates The Death"") with a serial killer. Offers a clif's notes review of the century's major serial killers, constant tension, crisp writing and outstanding performances.  In short, it is a very good, very scary movie, and you should see it it you haven't yet.   Personally, I also think Weaver looks fabulous.  Brains and beauty and character.  Nice combination. is very clever in its own right. It is undoubtedly influenced (heavily) by ""Silence of the Lambs"" but is successful in the way it adds its own qualities to the mix -- much like ""Se7en"" this is a serial killer movie cashing in on the success of ""Silence,"" but not necessarily stealing its content.Very surprised. Catch it if you can. Mulroney providing Hunter with the dashing detective sidekick Ruben Goetz. The viewer is drawn to start thinking along the same lines as the lead characters and twists in the plot ensure that you don't get it all right ahead of the storyline.Highly recommended for a night in.

Assassins (1995)	"out the movie is written by the same people who did the Matrix and I can see how that is so. Any movie with Banderas is usually good, and this is no exception. :) If anyone likes sniper movies like Enemy at the Gates or Leon the Professional, this is definitely a movie worth checking out. You won't regret it. Moore's eyes.  You can see the difference so easily.  Banderas is alive, which is good.  The best performance is probably from Julianne Moore who is the girl they have to get the disk from.  Special effects are good, as is the ending climax.  Overall, it is thrilling, with a fair amount of action and violence. the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, ""Assassins"" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously.Like ""Daylight"" and ""Copland"", ""Assassins"" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again. When I first watched this film, I had no idea it featured the would be superstar Antonio Banderas, nor that it was written by the soon to be Matrix creators.  In that sense it is almost a fun movie to watch because it kinda answers the question ""what did they do before they were famous?"" and now you know. so. From then on, it's battle between the two.The movie is quite similar to ""The Specialist""(1994) - another Sylvester Stallone movie - only that there he had no Banderas to fight against!A couple of words on the cast. Well, I already said that Stallone and Banderas did well but my compliments go to Julianne Moore. She was brilliant.Vote : 80/100. "	6.3	0
Powder (1995)	"humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time. a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery. so Sean does have pretty eyes, but, come on!On a side note, for those of you who think that the Deputy Sheriff's character was a ""stereotypical"" cop character, giving the police a bad name...I have relatives who are police in a small town like this one, and you should hear THEM talk over the dinner table. It ISN'T much different. The movie is trying so hard to be profound that it doesn't ring anywhere close to true. People are too stupid. People are too mean-spirited. The melodrama is too high. The actors sound fake. Powder is basically either going to be a superhero or supervillain. This could be a great comic book origin movie but every character is slightly wrong. do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind.

Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film. shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects. behind me!The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives have become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites. genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of ***** his heart. She sees him for what he is, because that's what responsible angels do.This is a work with metaphor far beyond the veneer of the surface dialog. It's a film demanding to be viewed more than once.

See this film. undoubtedly find favour with viewers more inclined towards modern tastes. It has high production values, a sweeping score, accessible delivery of the lines, flashy photography, and ""cool"" stylistic touches (Fishburne's head tattoo, for instance). Personally, I feel the 1952 Othello will always be the benchmark, but this one is reasonably well made and it compares quite favourably with other versions. chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacob's Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Do watch it. Fishburne however did a magnificent job!  He provided us an astonishing portrayal of how even a noble, righteous and even intelligent man, can succumb to ""the green eyed monster.""  The calculatingly evil Iago was FLAWLESSLY portrayed by veteran Shakespearian actor Kenneth Branagh, who occasionally stared into the eyes of the camera itself, explaining his dark plans and expectations. with Kenneth Brannagh's ""Hamlet"", the longest and most tedious of his self-advertisements, in which every long-winded speech was preserved intact. Here Brannagh's Iago is almost as good as Fishbourne's Othello, and he makes the most of the lines he has.To sum up, ten out of ten.

The story is just so great, i could watch the movie all over again.It makes you think that real friends do exist. I would give Now And Then 10/10 that has a likeable cast and is funny and expresses friendship. Yes, it is definetley a girl's movie, but even though, I enjoyed it. The movie is like Stand By Me, except it shows girls's perspectives. The film is a good and fun movie to watch for fun. I give Now and Then a 9 out of 10.  :) 'Gold Diggers' co-star, Ashleigh Aston Moore - as the mis-informed Chrissy. Bonnie Hunt ('Jumangi') and Devon Sawa ('Wild America') also star.The story is great - plenty of laughs to be had here, with sad moments, too.

Persuasion (1995)	"performances by Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister), Phoebe Nicholls (remember ""Brideshead Revisited""?), and Corin Redgrave is enough to make this movie recommendable, but the 2 main characters are absolutely superb and sympathetic without being sappy or gratuitous. The other supporting cast is phenomenal; what one expects from a nice little English film. Cinematography and soundtrack are fitting as well. Highly recommended! characters act within the conventions of regency England and seem to be comfortable doing so.I would recommend this movie to any Jane Austen lover or a person who enjoys period films or classic literature.  A person who does not fall into those categories might enjoy it as well, but is likely to find it slow and difficult to understand. Anne with their uselessness. Phoebe Nicholls, of Brideshead Revisted fame (she was Sebastian Flyte's youngest sister Cordelia) contributes yet another wonderful performance in her career, as the ill-tempered Elizabeth, ultimately conveying the tragedy of the burgeoning spinster in the last scene.Even if great literary classics aren't your ""bag"" don't miss this minor masterpiece if you happen to love great film-making. California has said, `I guess to make it a little more seductive to us over here'.  Nonetheless, it is pleasing to read that this film was well received in the States especially as it remained true to its British identity, and therefore set an exemplary standard in not pandering to an anticipated overseas market by using well-known international stars. life.

You can be the weakest person on earth but if your truly a good actor then you can make anyone believe your a tough guy or girl. The music was awesome.  The cast was great.

12 Monkeys (Twelve Monkeys) (1995)	"Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10 is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades. a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10 scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss! dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties. "	8.0	1

I often suggested this for viewing to classes of young people and adults needing an understanding of the real costs of success.Incredible scenery and every time I see an ant, I remember the endurance of that man and others like him who purchased our progress and freedoms by perseverance. it is the first drama IMAX film. The cast is just perfect and the plot will get you hooked. Now you can see it in your own home (it is now on video)! So if you can find it rent it tonight or if you have it playing at the local IMAX theater near you see it there.Grade Average: A while the public applauds men of lesser virtue (such as the pilot played by Val Kilmer). And it was nice to see Tom Hulce portray one of my own personal heroes - 'Saint-Ex'!This is one of the better films of true survival against near-impossible odds. The participants of those 'Survivor' shows should give this movie a viewing or two... really! 70mm films are shown on 35mm screens with apparent higher resolution when projected.  So this movie I would say is a diamond in the rough of IMAX/3D films: slickly produced, great sound, picture, cinematography, acting, and script, as well as beautiful breathtaking scenery of the Swiss Alps.

The acting is superb, the animatronics are unrecognizable as such, and James Cromwell is superb as the taciturn farmer willing to give the little pig a chance. But Babe has an awful lot of ambition for a little animal, and his heart is set on being a ""sheep-pig"".There are moments of sadness in this film, such as loss and death, but it is mainly sweet natured and enchanting. It is one of the few Universal rated films I enjoy watching, and that is saying something for me! call it a childrens film. It is simply a great film. A film that shows how wondrous things can happen as a result of common decency; how any individual can triumph if they believe in themselves; how vital is the help of family and friends in life's arduous journey.This a film not to be missed. It should have beaten Braveheart. or government officials. Here, he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings.

This is a film not to be missed. privy to so many more truths and realizations than you'll see in any other standard film about a romance. What we have here is a paradox: an old-fashioned story about an avant-garde arrangement.

In our society the love of ""one and only"" can be an oppressive ideal that few can attain, and Hollywood is its loudest proponent.  This movie allows for a well thought out exploration on of the many other faces of true love.  Superb acting, direction, editing, costuming, the works.  I highly recommend it. illustration. Combine this refreshing glimpse of consensual mores with outstanding interpretations by Thompson and Pryce, and with fidelity to historical fact, and you've got two delightful hours of first-rate cinema on your hands. And not an exploding car or a vengeance-driven, gadget-laden military operation against a demonized third-world country anywhere to be found. Amazing. And bravo. 9 out of 10. good actors but I believe its success is largely due to director Christopher Hampton's screenplay. It's a full two hour movie without the benefit of car chases, explosions or kickboxing matches, so it's a big plus to have something nice to look at for all that time.

If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. But whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There's not one false note in the film. more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.  The spirit and compassion of the book is dead-on accurate.  It amazes me that Robbins' screenplay adaptation was not even nominated for an Oscar in addition to the other four nominations this movie did receive.  As far as I am concerned, Robbins' direction and writing are assured, and I continue to look forward to his next projects. "	7.5	1

It Takes Two (1995)	seen. I love the way that they have one rich twin and one poor twin. the best part of the movie is when they are running through the woods screaming and the song hippie, hippie shake is playing. This is the best movie out of the olsen twins collection and i would recommend you see it giving it a 10/10. bump into eachother, they swap families in hopes of joining Roger with Diane (the Emmy award-winning Kirstie Alley).Mary Kate and Ashley are as cute as ever, Steve is fine (and really, that's all he is), Kirstie is great as Diane, but Jane is the best as the snotty Clarice.A great little comedy - and a must for Olsen twins fans. the first minutes. I couldn't stop watching this movie until the final credits rolled. Having raised two girls I was particularly tuned into the Olsen girls. I was blown away by how cute and funny and bright they were. And I thought the love story though predictable was tastefully handled and fairly intelligent. All in all a most enjoyable experience. for that to fail, instead they try to lead the orphan camp leader, Diane Barrows and Alyssas father together, if that will succeed you're just going to have to watch the movie.I think it was a really good movie made by the Olsen twins, amazing how good they can though they are so young.I give it *** of ***** stars to them for help and advice. I thought this movie was made with a beautiful plot, truly great acting, very nice camera work, and, very importantly, very good character development: enough time is taken to introduce every important character's life before getting anywhere near the main idea of the movie. I would, personally, give this movie a 10/10, hands down. 	5.8	0

In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10 of the picture who's only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It's worth renting anytime. Just like ""European Vacation"" it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that's worth it all. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. Seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- I'm so fond of this film personally that I would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it. all very good, although I do find Brittany Murphy slightly irritating. The plot isn't very deep, but at least it is there, as many teen movies lack this vital feature. I am a little worried about the characters only being 15/16 and acting extremely maturely for their ago, however that seems to be the only problem with this movie. 7/10 "	6.8	0

I think it's highly underrated with the average of 6.4 from the imdb voters.This is a movie about black and white. A welknown theme in Hollywood, but I've never seen a movie which deals with this subject so excellent as this one.I couldn't help crying at the end. my rate: 10 soft in this regard, but this is not what the film is about. James Earl Jones's depiction of an African Cleric in this time period is amazingly accurate. I had tears in my eyes watching his performance. Harris too shines.

Dead Presidents (1995)	"is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well. Tucker as Skip (Anthony's best friend) and Rose Jackson as Juanita (Anthony's girlfriend) do make ""Dead Presidents"" a movie worth seeing at least once.  That said, I would warn not to create a preconception based on the title, tagline or any publicity images that you might have seen, because they apply only to a small portion of the action. like for blacks in the late 60's early 70's movie, a what the Viet Nam war did to those who survived it movie, so on and so on. By the time it came around for the big robbery, I was wondering when this movie would end. This problem of too grand a scope keeps the movie from getting an A. for himself, but a struggling economy and lack of formal education gradually draw him into a life of crime. An effective portrayal of black involvement in Vietnam, with good performances, powerful scenes, and shockingly graphic violence. Tate is commanding in the lead, and Tucker a real surprise as his drug-addicted pal. Not for all tastes, but well-crafted and well-made. *** a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made, but of course, bloody. This movie is filled with great performances, the best coming from Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David, heart-pounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10.

Restoration (1995)	"time Robert entered into the home for the insane, it became engrossing. I thought the story of the ""Lost Valley"" was poignant and worth the whole movie.

A little gem -selected with care- to share with those you love. way, miraculously cured of her insanity by his physical attentions. Whoever twisted Hollywood arms to get her on this project should be quartered and drawn. Considering all, this movie made me curious enough to download a copy of Samuel Pepys Diary 1665 to read more about the history of the Restoration. Isn't that what a good historical adaptation should do? be released. 'Restoration' was filmed during 1994, and was delayed for release amid rumours of re-shooting scenes with Meg Ryan, and probable cold feet after the box-office difficulties with 'The Red Letter'.This movie has not been given the credits it truly deserves, and is an excellent illustration of Court life and marriage politics during the reign of Britain's sexiest Monarch! to a new societal design in which personal gain becomes an outcome of talent and contribution and not monarchical whim. Today, we are still challenged by the notion of privilege over substance. People in power still often give major opportunities to those they favor over those that could make important contributions who are less adept at playing the political game. insane Irish girl was perhaps a bit overwrought, I found little to fault in the movie. I have seen it three times and enjoy it thoroughly each time. I'm sorry I missed it on the big screen.

Sue me I love this film to death. and makes their characters believable.It's a quick and slick film, gets to the action and gets over with before you can ask too many questions.  It's a pretty decent martial arts film, and an outstanding video game' film.  And in 1995, it was the best game-inspired film you could find.  Today it's still in the top five. franchise (as far as the big screen goes) is in limbo. But at least we have this great classic filmed by Paul Anderson! If you enjoy video game films, martial arts, or the new age MK video games, I recommend you check this film out.

But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness, especially the fights with Sub-Zero and The Scorpion. That cleverness was required over brawn in most instances was also a nice touch.Overall, this is a great film that any fans of martial arts or fantasy films should enjoy. is very special and it was one of his early works in Hollywood, so he had to prove it. And he did it. He did a good job. Keep it in mind that this movie offers you only a tiny amount of blood. Whereas the game is extremely violent. This movie, reasonably is not. It's a decent fun!

To Die For (1995)	"the picture is framed: a pseudo-documentary within a pseudo-documentary. Everything is so well orchestrated that when Kidman gets her surprising, but entirely appropriate comeuppance at the end, we are quite pleased.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!) For.  If for nothing else, the film should be seen for the work of Kidman and Douglass.  (Note also that To Die For has one of Joaquin Phoenix's earliest roles.)As other commentators here have suggested, you are not guaranteed to love this film.  Nonetheless, as far as I'm concerned, it's required viewing if you're a film fan. Phoenix is great as probably the dimmest character in movie history!Best of all is Illeana Douglas as Dillons wonderfully cynical sister.""What did i first think of her?-Four letters beginning with 'c',you know......cold!"" This is beautifully put together using mock docu footage,flashbacks,and straight filmaking.Clever,intelligent,and razor sharp,films like this are all to rare.Look out for director David Cronenberg,in a wickedly good cameo! Kidman is the perfect choice for the seductress whose emotional age seems to be about ten years old and gives new meaning to the word ""superficial."" Joaquin Phoenix shows evidence of the star he would become. Alison Folland and Illeana Douglas are excellent.I'm an admitted Nicole Kidman fan and this film shows her talent. She's also a gorgeous woman. Recommended. pace never lingers for a moment as it rapidly presents an in your face comic and tragic pastiche of dark Americana. Van Zant admirably expresses it with a bold visual flair keeping scenes lean and sharp that over a dozen years later still retain there power and energy.

She also finds a very attractive young man, tempting her to cheat. What follows are stories told by and about each of the women in the quilting circle. The young women discovers that love is not perfect, and that you must take advantage of what you have, and that there is beauty in the known. what makes it special. Fast, but special. And the final highpoint, a literal ""storm"" that blows everything apart yet puts everything together, is a cinematic masterpiece, proof of heartfelt, imaginative work of both the writer and the director. They´re actually dreaming an ending together - just take this lovely movie in and stop bickering about reality. If you ask me. but it would take too long to mock them all.  The real trouble with the movie is that it was so earnest, so desperate to convince the audience of its poetic depths, that it wound up shallow, unsatisfying, unconvincing and unintentionally funny.Or, to put it another way--never have so many, who were so talented, worked on something so ordinary. like this are, first of all, even made, and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. There are many far better films about women and their unique experiences, the most recent one being a small film called High Art, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and starring Ally Sheedy in one of 1998's best performances.

In essence this film made it easier to come to terms with my own sexuality, because of that it will always have a special place in my heart. to actually viewing this film.  When I finally bought the film and watched it, it definately went beyond my expectations.  Everything about the film was near perfect.

A near perfect film. her boyfriend and the Christian school job. The circus performances scenes were great and interesting. The lovemaking scene between them is very passionate and romantic.

Highly recommended. this being a prime one.Since accidentally buying this film a week ago, I've been watching it almosteveryday. It is a very moving piece, incredibly romantic and beautifully shot.

Usual Suspects, The (1995)	"again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time. too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening... a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts. a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying. Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5 stars out of 5. "	8.6	1

The climax is a relatively large-scale speedboats-and-helicopter chase, but most of it appears to have been done by stunt doubles and is not very exciting. (**1/2) finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be.all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie.it's not like 'yes,madam'! or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10 awful wardrobe, which includes a really nasty pair of baggy denim jeans with stone washed areas on the seat that are far from flattering.After lots of so-so bouts of kicking and punching (plus plenty more fashion disasters from all concerned), the film wraps matters up with a mediocre chase scene involving a jet-ski, a helicopter, and a pair of speedboats.

Mighty Aphrodite (1995)	"his pictures.The story of ""Mighty Aphrodite"" is magic, light, funny and beautiful. The idea of the Greek chorus is just incredible! All the cast is great, but the best one is really Mira Sorvino. She deserved her Oscar playing Linda Ash, a nice and ingenuous prostitute.So if you like Woody Allen's films, you'll surely love this one like I did. she lacked chemistry with Woody.  Good also to see F Murray Abraham as the leader of the chorus - why do we see so little of him these days?I'm a fan of Woody, but he has been patchy in the last 10 years or so.  With this one, he really was in sparkling form.  Well worth seeing. own.Leave it to Woody Allen to deliver a film that is fascinating on many levels and is as beautifully structured as anything you're likely to see all year. I don't believe it's Best Picture material, but it does show a very strong return to form for Allen, no matter how unsure he is of reentering the war between the sexes. wants to improve the life of the hooker-come-porn-star and suggests hairdressing and teaming up with a half-wit boxer (who he met through his job as a sports writer) he thinks she will like.

Recommended. in for Mia Farrow just as well as Kenneth Branagh stood in for the Woodmeister in ""Celebrity"" - and how incestuous can we get here).

Lamerica (1994)	the significance of this simple act hits home with the force of a sledgehammer.Now released on DVD, 'Lamerica', one of the least typical but best films of the 90s, is well worth seeking out.  And even if (like me) you have to wait 9 years for a second viewing, I promise that its imagery will linger in your mind. with some of it. even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.  this film should be watched by all interested in understanding why people have to abandon their homelands. this is a perfect example and should open eyes to many. lire, only to get swallowed up by the depth of the Albanian situation. directing amazes me everytime more and more. A powerful movie, being very realistic and documentary. Once again, Enrico Lo Verso acting and leading the movie is great. This movie was filmed few years after the government was overthrown and I consider AMelio to be brave with this theme and from my understanding he reflected what happened in a realistic way. is also a lot of authenticity as Lamerica is based on the real story about the collapse of Albania after the end of a very long communist rule.How an affluent culture is blindly followed by a less fortunate culture has also been vividly described in Lamerica. This is exactly an element which makes the whole story palatable to audiences' tastes. 	7.6	1

Georgia (1995)	"admire the daring it took to include it.'Georgia' is a good, solid, if not spectacular film about sibling rivalry and family relations. Leigh is good in her role, as is Mare Winningham as the more subdued title character. Of the supporting cast I especially liked Max Perlich as a hero-worshiping fan that Sadie uses by turning him into her husband. a terrific job with very difficult material (about a very unusual and difficult, but interesting, lifestyle), and this movie calls out to me to watch it every time it plays on my satellite service.This movie should not be judged along with ""standards"".  It is a rare piece of filmwork, and should be judged entirely on its own standalone merits. because of this, the narrative arc is limited (especially as the film is quite long). In some senses, the film resembles other great films about the self-destructive, like 'Five Easy Pieces' or 'Naked'. It's not quite in that class, but it's double-headed structure makes it more reflective, less visceral, but by no means uninteresting. Overall, it's an unjustly neglected work. summation, this film will appeal to people who drink too much, people who tell me that it's a sin to know and feel too much within, which according to Bob Dylan many claim to live by and i concur; those with a penchant for '90s Seattle, rock and roll and dark character studies into alcoholism, thwarted ambition and pervasive despair. Leigh's believable portrayal, but had a more sympathetic character with which to work.  The stand-out, though, is Max Perlich as Sadie's worshipful husband/doormat.  My heart broke for him.  While the acting was strong, I found this film exhausting and kept checking to see how much time was left - it felt more like an assignment than entertainment. "	6.5	0

Great movie. a theme that permeates the movie: such as when the father watches the home movie of his children, illuminating one of the pivital moments of his life that was only seconds in length, but brings his life such joy and meaning.  The movie reminds us that it is ""the very thought of you"" that brings joy to us all. The director's commentary by Foster gives a clue that he was frustrating to work with, but it seems very worth it here. He is just SO watchable, boistrous, too-energetic, motor-mouthed and loveable.

Watch this movie if you are disillusioned with the notion of romance, and need some succour. The movie once again reinforces my admiration for the Italian film-makers.

""Il Postino"" won't blow you away, but its tender lessons about life, love, and friendship will stick with you for some time, urging another viewing. Bottom Line: A very European romance that is better than most anything Hollywood can conjure up.  8/10.

Mel Gibson could use a little poetry himself.Grade: A her. They're a fair representation of a real couple who were brought together for what might have been the wrong reasons.

With just a bit of profanity early on and a bit of obvious political correctness, there is nothing in here which should offend viewers. Critics didn't seem to care for it, so you know it truly was a nice, wholesome film....and fun to watch. the tearful ending just right for a young audience. Interesting to note Steve Coogan plays a miniature model come to life - something he repeats later in his career in A Night At The Museum. Typecasting?The effects are also very good. Remember this is 1995 when CGI was in it's infancy - but the miniaturisation of the cast is flawless. is such a natural.  He's completely believable, as is his friend. The Indian is also wonderfully brought to life.  How they made the special effects work so well back in 1995 (well... that was a while back for film special effects anyway...) I don't know.  I wish we could see more warm hearted films like this today. performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids (like ""Inspector Gadget"" - a truly awful film) and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it. like this is that they are pure fantasy and they feature the type of things that most young kids dream about.

However every scene is pushed hard by director John Schlesinger. Kiefer is all greased up. This is not a subtle movie but it could do with some. It's unnerving but in a bad way.

The rape scenes are very disturbing, I warn you. You might need a strong stomach, especially for the scene I described with Karen on the phone with her daughter. The ending is a little short and felt rushed, but I would always recommend this for a watch.8/10 is a shame that lawyers use breaches in the laws to defend scums like the character Robert Doob, but that is the sad reality. The praiseworthy attitude of Karen McCann is an exception but perfectly understood in the situation. The acting is excellent and the plot is timeless. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Olho por Olho"" (""Eye for an Eye"") the scene is VERY graphic in nature.

The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.

Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind, and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually, though, he learns to accept and deal with these challenges, and becomes more loving and appreciative. I recommend ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for musicians, singers, music teachers, and really everyone. Enjoy the show! my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.

This movie isn't a total spoof of movies with a couple of original jokes here and there.

Two if by Sea (1996)	"mixture of charm, sarcasm, and innocence play out well.  The movie knows it's not too sophisticated or shrewd (even the cop says of his own investigation, ""this is too easy"") and it's a great film to watch on an afternoon or just to be entertained.  If you're a Sandra fan, you'll like it no matter what.  :) where Leary was going fishing and he shoots one of the fish.  Then he cooks it up, serves it up to Bullock and she spits out a bullet.

Leary is consistently Leary (maybe he was born a fully developed adult), while Bullock in 1996 is growing into the superstar that we know today.

Bio-Dome (1996)	"the lame jokes and one dimensional, almost cartoon like characters. You have to wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to go ahead and make it. The movie ensnares the viewer by opening with a promising start. The movie quickly deteriorates from there. Stephen Baldwin only adds to the overall idiocy. As if one bad actor wasn't enough. not by much, and its sad, because I've seen him in other roles which he played incredibly well. I usually find at least some redeeming features in 'stoner' movies, or even like them-- (the Clerks series, Bill and Ted, etc.)-- but this movie is just really bad. The supposed protagonists are so idiotic and obnoxious that its painful to watch. low user rating of 3.8 when movies like ""You don't mess with the Zohan"" which is possibly the worst film ever made manage to get over 5.0!!!! Bio-dome is a great ""swith-off your brain"" type of film which shouldn't be taken seriously at all. So crank out the beers or the bong or both and just zone into the dome! films as Outside Providence, Double Tap and Double Bang.But back with the film...For you who have had the privilege, yes PRIVILEGE to have enjoyed this film, I'm sure you will agree that this classic must never be forgotten, and certainly this awe-struck fan will always have it at the forefront of his mind.Go for the Baldwin, stay for the Shore... and Shore fans or family related.After the film bombed in American cinemas, in Australia it was decided by it's distributors that it would be dumped straight to video-store shelves, even though it had huge Aussie-born singing star Kylie Minogue(Dr. Petra von Kant) co-staring.

Two Bits (1995)	The situations our protagonist gets into are sometimes funny, sometimes sad. As trivial as his quest to get 25 cents may seem, I wanted him to accomplish it.  The ending is sad, though not unexpected.  Mainly, it's the richly developed characters and their interactions that make this a solid film.  My score:  8 (out of 10) may consider it bad taste - if not unethical - to use the Great Depression for the setting of a nearly magical story, but I wish to assert that the movie did a very impressive job portraying the setting without getting sappy; then again, how could an Al Pacino movie be sappy? I recommend it. Also starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. like a good book: hard to put down once you start. At 84 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, either. Even though there is little profanity, I would not recommend this as family fare because the film touches on a disturbing doctor and his wife.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and glad to see it's out on DVD now, too. but very personal journey. I've seen this film about 10 times and have never made it all the way through without crying. This is a beautiful film in todays blockbuster big movie era. No special effects just emotions. Definitely better than 5.8 out of 10 I would say more like 8 out of 10. Mary Elizabeth and Al are magnificent- this director could only be worse.Hats of to the writer: Joseph Stefano. Because beside the fact that the film itself has a decent plot, the final sentence as i said before really blew me away. This movie is readable in different ways so everybody can enjoy it. Only thing is everybody will read different things in it. A must see... 	6.3	0
French Twist (Gazon maudit) (1995)	"to the human relationships that develop in this bizarre triangle. The script could have been a little less linear, but the characters are well developed and well played. Overall, French twist is a fun light comedy which probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow in Europe but will need a very open minded audience in the US. Unfortunately we're not ready yet. that everything will work out well in the end. And it does. The moral of the story, affirmed at the end, is that the only things that matter are love, tenderness and affection and if we get those the source's sexual gender is immaterial; we are all bisexual.This is a bright, witty and observant comedy, well-acted, particularly by Victoria Abril, of those in films. However, when the masculine Marijo, played poignantly by Josiane Balasko, enters their lives, the story takes many unexpected and entertaining turns which render a fairly common theme completely unpredictable. Everyone to whom I recommend this film ends up watching it numerous times and recommending it to others. The soundtrack is now one of my most-played CD's. (Alain Chabat) will have to go through.3. I gave a rating of 6 because it's not a masterpiece. But if you find the plot outline attracting, if you ever wonder ""What would I do if my wife leaves me for another woman ?"", or if you want to see an uncommon film about relationships, you will not be disappointed ! Instantly accessible to monolinguists - and yet its panache and pace could only be French (yeah, I know Abril is Spanish).Incidentally, I know we're not really supposed to respond to other comments from IMDb users, but it's interesting to note that the movie-loving community displays just as much intolerance and uptightness about sexuality as any other disparate group of people.

The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like? don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see. his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10 	7.3	0

Kicking and Screaming is a film deserving to be recognize as a journey through the minds of graduates and self-discovery of oneself.  Grover's speech at the airline ticket counter may be the best monologue in the history of cinema.  Am I gushing irrationally here?  Perhaps a little.  But this film needs to be seen and recognized as the little gem (that's often better than anything else in the same genre done by a major studio/director) that it is. of this film (need the DVD to come out before my tape wears out).So I can't say enough about this film.

The story and characters are as unique as they are addictive. When the movie ended, I found myself wanting more. This is one movie that will stick with you. I dare you to watch it only once.If you enjoyed Bed of Roses, you might also like At First Sight with Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. open up his heart again, too.

It is a bouquet of humor, heartache, and happy endings that will have you floating on air, smiling like crazy. The only downfall was the trite script, but that was more than made up for by the wonderful acting, and the beautiful idea of the story.

Screamers (1995)	fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10 ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal.  By their standards, I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything.  These surface similarities will always be there.  One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory.  In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!! pulled off the sort of paranoia we saw in The Thing, there was some nice tension as the story unfolded, although it fell apart a bit at the end.Bottom line - if you're a sci fi fan sniffing around for some sci fi you haven't seen but don't want to sit through a total dog, it's not a bad renter. style endings - although in fairness it isn't quite as bad as that.  The special effects are a bit ropey but do the job - after all this is a very low budget movie.The whole thing is not as good as it could have been but is certainly head and shoulders above a lot of low budget sci-fi thrillers. end is very surprising and tense. Weller and Rubin really shine in these scenes and do well to affect the audience's emotions. The script, which is good throughout, is also especially good in the final sequence.With more money behind it and better direction, Screamers would be a Sci-Fi classic, as it is, Screamers is an underrated, well acted, great story. 	6.4	0

Instead of more action it would have been interesting if the ethical aspect of a compromised juror (albeit unwillingly) could have been explored in the spirit of 12 Angry Men.

Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the villain and Anne Heche gives all she has as the token best friend.

Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995)	"legitimate but failing business, ""After Life Advice"" for people who are terminally ill and wish to pass on a legacy to their loved ones beyond the grave.Everyone involved with this film should be proud of their accomplishment. It is a great film and unfortunately hasn't been seen by many, by my account anyway. Let's see if we can't change that. Spike Lee's new film, the issues of mortality, and aspirations and dreams are key. The film's sombre tone is perfect - not too downbeat (there are many hilarious and happy moments), but enough to make us understand the importance of the issues at stake. Aside from staunch, happy-to-be-cynical other imdb reviewers, the film will affect, and perhaps even instruct. Recommended. Shhh! Acting is very good, with Garcia earning his quality pathos stripes, Williams doing psycho with ease, Forsythe a mighty machismo presence, Lloyd resigned and pitiless and Walken turning in another in his long line of bitter scary bastards.Worthy of interest to neo-noir fans for sure, but frustration sits in the narrative to stop it being an essential viewing. 6.5/10 you like films like Usual Suspects that combine the action genre with actual thought and character development rent this film and see if you can watch it only once.  In the same ballpark try Way Of The Gun with Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe, another film where ""pretty boys"" are actually allowed to explore their craft of acting. a unique voice as a writer, and this film attempts to create its own reality.  All those who say they 'hate' this film should rent their copy of HAPPY GILMORE and keep their opinions to themselves.

They happen to be mainly women, which is a refreshing change in a world where so often the female characters are only there as props for the male stars. I give it fourteen thumbs up! this film. It flies in the face of convention, but that is its beauty. Some would fear the freedoms this film demonstrates.Love and acceptance abound, in a timeless manor. I like the way it offered a different definition of family, one where diversity is an asset, guarded by respect.This is one of the greatest stories to come across the screen. these issues, showing women's strength in dealing with religious hypocrites and single motherhood, but I personally didn't feel the film was encouraging all women to leave the church or raise up families independently.  It's a marvelous story of women's strengths and vulnerabilities, and the love that the women in one family share.  ALL people will enjoy this film. (naratively essential) scenes of violence make it inappropriate for young or sensitive children. It is overall, however, not gritty or depressing.

It's clear Jaglom's working on a shoestring budget knows a few people in the business and makes the most of what he has. I usually admire scrappy auteurs like Herzog and Fuller who have to sacrifice for their independence, but with that freedom must come form, content and talent, none of which Jaglom displays in this pompous loser. a legendary matriarch whose attempts at self-effacement never quite ring true.This is a funny, loving look into the foibles of a theater family -- their fatuously ego-driven yet heart rending issues. For theater lovers and mature fans of Ibsen, Chekov, Joyce, Mike Leigh, Bergman or Allen ""Last Summer"" will be satisfying. For others, be forewarned. You may miss the point. example, the scene where Oona goes to see her producer at a sandwich shop; their dialog, and that last moment where he's trying to get a kiss out of her and she's barely resisting--one of the best moments I've seen on film.If you like good acting, thick psychological stuff, colorful characters, preening never-been jackasses, and deep humanity, see this film. ever-changing toehold into theater from whomever will grant her one.For those who are game- and it does get better with repeated viewings- there is a lot of humanity and warmth under all the dysfunction on display, and Foyt and Lindfors are standouts in a cast that does a good job of inhabiting characters who clearly need to get over themselves.

Byatt novella ""Morpho Eugenia"", however, that is going to be my next project. Naturally, I would be curious to see how the film and the novella compare. Either way, I still feel that ""Angels and Insects"" deserves my highest regards.  Several have complained about the actors, saying that there is not a single stand-out performance.  I disagree, as both Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas (in a performance worthy of an oscar nomination) acquit themselves well.  The script is also very well written, and the costumes deserved the Oscar nomination.  One of the ten best of 1996. tinsel and trappings. Those, however, who can get past all that will find a masterpiece of filming, acting, directing, writing, costuming, orchestration, etc. A slowly captivating and somewhat melancholy story of the goings-on within an English manor, ""A&I"" delivers powerful drama, sterling performances, and masterful execution by the auteur. A great watch for those who love cinema for cinema's sake. "	7.0	0
White Squall (1996)	"team. A truly moving story and another great film by Ridley Scott. From struggles to strengths, this is an inspiring film to watch with many good actors, Jeff bridges is really good for this role playing a tough, wise teacher for the boys. I love this as it is based on a true story, it makes it even more moving. the voyage under the watchful eye of an Ahab-esque but eventually sympathetic Jeff Bridges. The final scene most definitely resembles that of Dead Poets' Society. (Captain. My Captain). However the film as a whole never bores and makes for compulsive viewing at times particularly the superb storm of the title, that is both moving as well technical tour de force. few parts but unless you intended it to be a 3 month long movie some parts had to ""wind up on the cutting floor"" as one poor soul commented. People just watch movies nowadays rather than ""live"" them, understand them, try to find out what the message was. This movie showed soul, it moves me every time I watch it. except for maybe the final scene, in my eyes White Squall lives up to this.I think this is an enjoyable movie, when you're just lying back on the couch relaxing and let it flow over you. No difficult story, but it has great shots and pretty good acting and most of the characters are reasonably developed.7,5 (for making us cry) acting is excellent in all cases. As a Jeff Bridges fan, I was surprised I'd never heard of it before it appeared on late night TV. The last looks exchanged between the captain and his wife are about as good as they get. Not a really great movie but I found it well worthwhile as a non-fan of action movies. "	6.6	0
Dunston Checks In (1996)	"to see. She shows a nice comedic touch. The chimpanzee is probably the most entertaining, which is the idea, but so is the villain played by Rupert Evert. In other words, there are a lot of likable characters in this movie.This a ""sleeper:"" an underrated film that a lot of people would enjoy. I'm sorry it never got much ""press."" an ape, not a monkey) is well in its place as a comedy actor, and as said - the ideas are good, the working-out is even better.Not 'the best movie you'll ever see', not even close. Not a 'must-see movie'. But a very pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. And enjoyable for both adults and children, that's worth something too. manager of a major hotel is stretch, at least initially due to his stereotype; however, after watching it a half hour you forget that it is ""George"" and get involved with the other characters.Another reason to watch is to see Faye Dunaway's amazing post-op face lift and Pee-wee Herman as the ""Animal Catcher""? Good, clean fun for the whole family! Faye Dunaway plays the same kind of character that she played in ""Network"", only bitchier. And if it seems that I try too hard to analyze a movie like this, so be it. Above all, I still consider Faye Dunaway REALLY hot! And I'm sure that I always will.Also starring Jason Alexander, Rupert Everett and Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman). without Dunston Checks In? In some Hollywood executive's trash, that's where. Because of pioneer movies like ""Dunston Checks In"" movies like MVP and MXP enjoy much commercial success. So grab your kids, round up the neighbor, pop some popcorn, and get ready to laugh, and cry at one of the best movies in the last twenty years: ""Dunston Checks In"". "	5.3	0
Black Sheep (1996)	"BOY has a lot more of them. Watch TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP back to back and prepare to laugh like you have never laughed before. Chris Farley and David Spade are, in my opinion, the funniest duo ever to appear onscreen. It's a shame they didn't get to make a more movies together before Farley's death. My rating: ***1/2 collapses on top of Spade during the hail storm and the ""Power to the People"" speech at the rock concert are hilarious.Most viewed this film as inane and childish - one reviewer I distinctly remember said that he would rather have Des O'Connor sing him the phone book than watch this again - but I found myself laughing many times. Heslov, and Bruce McGill. All of them were funny as hell. Maybe with the exception of Gary Busey's character, who I must admit was pretty stupid. The film had a good story though, and it was sweet-natured along iwth being majorly crude and funny. I recommend ALMOST HEROES and TOMMY BOY *if* you liked this movie. BLACK SHEEP gets 4/5. Busey, for example, is brilliantly cast as a paranoid Vietnam veteran and comes through with the funniest performance by far. Chris Farley has barely one or two mildly funny moments in the entire film, but he does achieve some touching ones, and his honest efforts to amuse his audience in any way he can at least earn your respect.

It's not a classic thriller but it's quite an original idea and plot and almost manages to keep the tension for the whole movie. is solid as the father in a role that's different from a lot of his earlier roles.  The always excellent Walken is, as usual, awesome as the bad guy, a role I always love to see him in.  The film keeps you going, by offering a couple of nice twists.  Ignore the reviews and rent this movie. gets involved in a deadly plot.  An intriguing plot that had me thinking what I would do in the situation.  Christopher Walken was, as usual, creepy and Johnny Depp was believable.  The rest of the cast was very competent.  I'd advise renting it.  Not a special effects extravaganza but a nicely written fast moving movie. at times, the film nearly falls apart from the unlikely false plot moment near the third act and an unsatisfying conclusion. Despite all this, this is a well directed picture that certainly worth a look of this truly real mixed bag film. Written by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Courage Under Fire, A Home of Our Own, Mr. Holland's Opus).

This  is a powerful film about a man's struggle to follow his conscience despite a world that  insists he do otherwise.  I can't believe that until today (Aug 3, 2003), I had not seen this  film.  Too bad movies like this aren't made more often. Excellent acting, writing,  directing, cinematography.  A++ the kind of conclusion that makes many other films seem incomplete and shallow. This is an excellent film. It's also very family-friendly aside from some thematic elements (a slave is cleaved in half, animals are slaughtered, and so forth). I purchased it on a whim and never regretted the twenty bucks I spent. Everyone should see this at least once. with such wonderful stories of pioneers struggling to fit in with neighbors, families mingling beliefs and faith. Our forefathers have been in Buncombe county since Revolution days. With little access to this area, it has until recently been untouched with modernization. Our people were simple but lived as Kings. Jason Patric was wonderful in this movie. I am a fan. If you want a movie that will boost your hope, this is a movie for that. I think it is hard to believe that this movie wasn't seen on the big screen, or really advertised. It has excellent immersion, and doesn't look or feel like a cheap movie. I think it is one of the best stories told in film. 	6.6	0
Mary Reilly (1996)	" It should not be written off as just another big-budget Hollywood failure, because its aims, whether conscious or not, are quite different from your average thriller or period film.   Approach it with an open mind, be prepared for a dark and disconcerting vision, and you might be rewarded because this film is unique, baroque, different and great. which she must survive...While the dialect is at times choppy, she is believable as an Irish maid; and the supporting cast also lends credence to this story. Malkovich varies his performance between Jekyll/Hyde, and it is effective and visceral.If you initially avoided this film, I would highly recommend seeing it now. The atmosphere and music are haunting and sad. 9/10 (played by John Malkovich) when he didn't change facial appearances! And, yes, the film, generally- speaking, is a real downer, a depressing tale. Yet, for some odd reason, despite the above paragraph, I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and subtle suspense, even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating. is very quiet and slow and may put some viewers to sleep.  Another issue I had was the lovely Henson-Workshop-provided effects at the end, which are imaginative, but don't make a bit of sense when compared to the rest of the film.  If you can stomach a quiet and very subtle thriller, however, this is a real gem. dour chambermaid, and I think that's what put off so many people.  Obviously, most people like their Julia flashing her now $20 million dollar smile.  I say, ""good for you for trying something different.""

Vampire in Brooklyn (1995)	"problem. Now, looking back almost twenty years later, the wig does not look bad, and this was far from rock bottom for Murphy. For Craven, it may not be his strongest film, but it may also not be his worst (""Cursed"" is pretty bad).Seriously, this is not that bad of a film, even if the humor never hits exactly right. the Nutty Professor films is no less abrupt than those between horror and comedy in ""Vampire"".It's just that the choice of horror as the second element mixed with the comedy is a more daring and unusual one.Years from now, ""A Vampire in Brooklyn"" will be viewed as one of the highpoints of the second phase of the Eddie Murphy Genre. have to say that Eddie Murphy makes a good vampire. His version of a vampire is cool but SO totally evil.And his sidekick Kadeem Hardison(also seen in the movie Drive) is funny. In all a good movie. I guarantee that once you start watching this movie you'll be hooked and wont want to finish watching it until the end. 8/10 But Eddie pulled it off. Yes- I feel that he truly did. He had that hypnotic stare and seductive movement that would've paralyzed me too if I was in his presence then too. So I give this movie the thumbs up and not just for vampire lovers and not just for Eddie Murphy fans- this is quite an entertaining film. have noticed that many of his films have pretty poor ratings here on IMDB, including this one, which has a shockingly low rating.I thought the film had very funny moments, and Murphy had a good rapport with his Ghoul. Also, the plotline was pretty interesting. I thought it worked very well, and I hope that the IMDB rating will improve. "	4.5	0

I own the Blu-ray disc, btw this was very hard and difficult to get on Blu-ray. Hard Target was easy this movie wasn't easy to get. John Woo, John Travolta and Christian Slater all did a wonderful job. wouldn't work. He's done too many goody-goody roles to come back down to this. Laws of nature will not allow him to make another good movie where he plays a bad guy. Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one. on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Blu-ray's to get me this movie on Blu-ray I actually have this film in Blu-ray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find. I have them both on Blu-ray discs. Travolta overdoes the psycho routine, hamming it up when some restraint would have made for a more believable performance, but his considerable charm sees him through.  Christian Slater, an actor who hasn't impressed me as anything more than a Jack Nicholson wannabe, makes a surprisingly commendable hero. This movie is junk food, of course, but it's very tasty indeed. its up to Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis to save the world.. Overall a good action flick with a leave your brain at home plot..Travolta goes slightly over the top with his character but is still good..Slater is ok and Mathis does what she can with what little the script gives her.. on a scale of one to ten... 6 	6.0	0

This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this. It is, however, their loss.It's hard to recommend this film highly enough, but I should add that more than one viewing is required to get the best from La Haine. very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel. A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.10/10 a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.This certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s.

I bought the film at what you British call a jumble sale for $2.00 (American money), so I'm not out a lot of loot in any case. I will keep the film alongside ""Love, Honour and Obey"", another second-hand bargain I found along the way. It too, has redeeming features. a good movie. The story, all the action aside, is really about Billy's seething self-hate and unwillingness to love and be loved. The cars, the ram-raiding, the police, Tommy, the estate... it's all just a backdrop to the story of the slow and tragic destruction of an depressed young man caught in a world he has learned only to hate. and Sadie are far too posh for the criminal underworld characters. Sadie's accent is eventually recognisable as a strain of Irish, sounding slightly like Jerry Adams on helium. This film wants to be an urban Mad Max and ends up looking like what it is  a posh cast trying to play scum and looking embarrassingly out of their depth. he'd already attempted to chat up a stranger in a club! It reinforces one's perception of him as a big kid unwilling to grow up. . . Characters' actions have to be believable, and his aren't.

Not that it doesn't have style, mind you. And, Jonathan Pryce, Sean Bean, and Marianne Faithful help make the trip.

At times, one can only marvel at the audacity of this guy: whether badgering known drug-dealers and pimps until they all but plead with him to GO AWAY, or making what amounts to crank calls to an underworld enforcer (and possible ex-Moussad hit man) Broomfield walks through it all with a zeal it is hard not to admire. itself. Only Fleiss, after finally granting Broomfield an interview, seems halfway on the level, coming across as surprisingly down-to-earth, sharp, attractive and witty - if not entirely trustworthy. It's the one moment of grace. But for the most part, this film is akin to being stalked by evil, chuckling pimps while trapped in an ever replicating maze of funhouse mirrors. Darryl Gates, who accepts a nice cash sum before his interview; crooked top detective Mike B. (can't think of his name right now); and porn stars Ron Jeremy and Tisa.

City Hall (1996)	 But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the end.  I wish I could like this more, but no. in this day and age without gratuitous sex, violence, bombs and bullets, profanity.On a cinematic level, I found the directing, acting (the entire cast) and production to be first rate.I realize that many, many people (possibly the large majority) don't see things as I've described here. But if what I've written resonates, then you'll probably like this movie a lot. mentioned. The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable. As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays. together, and the supports from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press.

Bottle Rocket (1996)	"characterisation enables the viewer to develop understanding and affection for the protagonists as the story slowly unravels. In ""Bottle Rocket"" this is supported by strong performances, especially that of Owen Wilson, who proves his actor potential in an atypical role.Though not flawless, (there is a lack of narrative urgency at times), this movie leaves the viewer ultimately entertained and charmed. subtle humor and deliveries by the actors make the movie stand out in it's own little version comedy. The characters are losers, but lovable. You can't help but cheer them on even though what they do is illegal. I highly recommend this cool little film. It's an excellent introduction into the wonderful films of Wes Anderson.RATING: **** out of **** struggle to realize his dream of becoming a crook in spite of his many shortcomings: sensitivity, compassion, empathy, and just plain niceness. Luke Wilson plays straight man to real life brother Owen in this camp, light-hearted, and easy to watch little film about the ""gang who couldn't think straight"". A fun watch for just about anyone into droll humorous subtleties. so self -involved and moody like most independent films can be. And while it has a bright appeal, it is more eccentric than campy like most mainstream comedies can be. This is truly a unique comedy and I get the feeling that one day, the lines of hipness will be drawn between who has seen this movie and who hasn't. lovely film, I really don't see how you couldn't like it. Some how this just misses out on being a real classic on a level with Big Lebowski, maybe its because not as many people have seen it or something, either way its definitely in my top ten or top five or something.

Tim Curry looked like he was having the time of his life playing Long John Silver amidst a sea of Muppets.  I had great fun watching his performance. Go watch this movie if there's even a spark of kid in you.  You won't regret it. plays Long John Silver to perfection. Billy Connolly is also worth mentioning, despite his brief appearance in the film.  And young Jim Hawkins is just as he should be, albeit surrounded by a crew of muppet pirates.This is my favorite Muppet film, and I think everybody should give it a try and embrace a different sort of humor-filled extravaganza. sure beats the hell outta ""The great muppet caper"" (How slow was that movie?!). Tim Curry, the greatest and most under rated musical preformer alive, is at his element here. The music is awsome and his one song (""Upstage Lads, this is me only number!"") is awsome. This is a good movie. For a pirate movie, and a muppet movie. to be annoying and forgettable, but not this one.I've watched it about 30 or 40 times (the joy of having a young child who is hooked on one show :-)I don't get tired of it. Fun songs, Tim Curry is enough to watch the film anyway, good plot.Where else will you hear a name like 'big fat baby-eating O'Brian' ??? Tim Curry for his fine job as Long John Silver, and to the entire cast of puppeteers, without who this film would not be possible. The relationship between Silver and Jim is also well-developed, as it is difficult to watch them part at the end. The songs are fun, the ending touching..and of course, humorous! Give this movie another try. "	7.0	0
Headless Body in Topless Bar (1995)	"it was SOOO intense and I loved it because I felt like I had actually experienced something that made me think about human nature, the will to survive, and the pain of vulnerability.If you are looking for a provocative, thought provoking movie this is a sure bet. It you want light hearted entertainment rent something with Meg Ryan in it. sit through multiple takes of these incredibly painful, poorly- written scenes.  But most of all, I feel sorry for my friends and myself.  We lost an hour of our lives to this movie, and we can never, ever get that hour back.If this review keeps one person from making the same mistake, then my work here is done.... they were very believable. This movie was quite different and intriuging to watch especially after learning that it is based on an actual event that caused the New York Post to headline ""Headless body in Topless Bar"" back in the 80's. Not a movie for everyone but if you like dark and disturbing films you might just enjoy this one. friend watching strippers while Joe comments on the size of their, em, talents.   From the style this could almost be a student or art film, as surreal as it is, but it is the real deal.  Stay away unless you like to see Burbons poured down the neck of a headless guy by a faithful best friend. movie, and the worst part is the ending song. some homemade thing with these words ""its in awful condition the world is a mess. when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed. the cops they are clueless, eating donuts in their car. newspaperflash next morning: headless body,topless bar.""

Braveheart (1995)	shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films. amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century. and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.Out of ten............10/10! away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga. Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more importantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry, vivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history. Along with the unforgettable 'Alba gu bragh!' and the unprecedentedly heart-stopping 'Freeeeedom', Braveheart unquestionably is one of the greatest movies ever made. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level. True, the historical content may have been distorted, but even though, this movie is meant for entertainment. It is not a history lesson caught on video.The acting is absolutely superb, this movie is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat for the entire three hours. 	8.4	1
Taxi Driver (1976)	"of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label. 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece. me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does. seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5 Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation. "	8.3	1

The story got me to thinking what I would have done if any of my teenage children had gotten into a similar bind. With a great writer and director this could have been a ""10"" movie. I rate it 7 of 10. coming out of their mouths were often so silly, it makes you wonder how the same person who wrote 'The Silence of the Lambs' also wrote this screenplay. Overall, despite the script flaws, it has quite a good mystery, and besides the young daughter, a brilliant cast. It is worth a watch, if just for the main casts' beautiful performances. criminal justice system, where defence and prosecution teams become engaged in brinkmanship designed to sway the jury one way or another. Ted Tally's screenplay makes a number of similar points, but the narrative begins to drift around the halfway mark and never really recovers. Some will be won over by the cast and production values, others won't be so forgiving. a feature film that, without movie star names attached, would have ended up as made for TV.  This is a weak script with bad, predictable dialogue - very disappointing with such a cast. With some reworking, it might have been a very powerful family story, perhaps never as compelling as Ordinary People, for instance, but better than it was. how the actors responded to each other as members of a family, and I found that they were not only well cast, but were all up to the challenge, delivering themselves quite honorably. This incident could have happened to any ordinary family, and there but for the grace of God, go I.Of four ****, I rate three and a half. "	6.1	0

You bet! to Margaret's ""Cost of Coal"" museum which she opens as an expression righteous indignation. The museum sequences bookend the main story (told in a long flashback).

A few little story holes that were slightly annoying - an uncle supposedly out on bail for arson back in his old job lickety split and a grandchild that had disappeared - but not enough to detract from an overall fine film. Even the second time around! their toll on the mine workers and their families. Not just another coal mining flick, ""MM"" focuses with musings, humor, and poignant moments on Margaret, who's nose is always running, and her assorted quirky family and friends. An engrossing, somewhat compelling, and almost charming little film, ""MM"" should appeal to those with a taste for slice-of-life flicks involving eccentric folk. a script that takes a real, human character and gives her one such bizarre action to commit. But ""Margaret's Museum"" is a fascinating, unexpected film. It takes a well-used dramatic arc and directs it toward uncommon places. It captures the spirit and feel of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Something I've known quite well, and could always feel more. See this. "	7.3	0

I think to myself, ""How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?"" This being the case, though, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start.  It's a story that everyone should know. the Frank family, and Anne in particular. Although it is a bit slow moving at first (detailing their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful.Due to some of the footage and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it for children but for adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through one young girl.

Absurdity and grimness are very skillfully balanced. A marvelous, overlooked film. film but one that has enough going for it to be worht watching.  However it should be noted that it is quite cruel and upsetting  we are not allowed to feel anything for Graham's victims.  The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark. reacting to poison, but these are necessary to heighten the audience's horror at Graham's incapability to assess his own actions and to recognize his own evil.  Ross gives us an entertaining, yet twisted, glimpse into genius gone wrong, without sensationalizing Graham as a hero.It is also very hard to go out for drinks or coffee after seeing this movie. ""Clockwork"" are almost inevitable, but unlike Kubrick's thriller, this one has a more subtle, menacing tone, for the mind rather than for the eye.  It's not a laugh-out-loud film, though it's undeniably hilarious.  Whatever you feel, it's kept inside.If you're one with a sensitive stomach, suicidal tendencies, strange addictions, goody-goodies/puritans, then stay away.  Otherwise, WATCH THIS FILM! humor in this black comedy right on target and I actually felt sorry for the young poisoner.

Wearing funny hats and talking in different rhythms, Schaeffer doesn't really overplay or underplay--he's a goofy mensch, but not a dynamic one like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. He's careful to give his character some shading, yet the quirks--like much of the serious dialogue--are superficial. *1/2 from **** had extricated herself from a dead-end relationship!)

I'll admit that I couldn't stand watching the last 20 minutes, but I do know how it ends. Anyway, it would have turned out better if Joe came out of the closet.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It should get a rating of 1. Don't watch this movie! Maybe people talking about spitting in each other's mouths could be slightly funny if the writer had any talent or could sense any direction, but no. Evaluating the performances is pointless, since any actor working with this material is obviously in too much pain to develop a character.  Save your money and life, avoid this movie at all costs! to understand that love is much more stronger than lust. If you didn't enjoy this movie the first time viewing...give it another chance.

I've since warmed up to it (and removed my negative comments in this edit). Take that for what it's worth -- and I hope it's worth something, because I'm not a big fan of eating crow in public. to be a comedy with a moral message, this actually has no redeeming features whatsoever. From the lack of decent jokes to Garcia's squabbling siblings, it's a film that will have you looking at your watch more often than you look at the screen. When the supporting cast of livestock out-act everybody and everything else, you know you're in trouble. for another fine Andy Garcia work. roles very nicely. However, about 45 minutes before the end of this very long movie, it turned into a mad, mad world slapstick which just insulted all the character and plot development that you as the viewer had invested.

Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer today.This TV film stops just a little short of being a masterpiece. When it ends you should rise to your feet and give it an ovation. Most definitely a courageous indictment, so exquisitely handled: otherwise it might well have been a disaster. `The Boys of St. Vincent' is most definitely one of the best TV films I have ever seen. makes it all the more more powerful. (Your skin crawls but you can't stop watching, and you truly get a sense of what these orphans are going through.) It's frightening to think that orphaned children are at the mercy of twisted institutions such as this...and sadly, always will be. An extremely memorable film that you'll only want to see once.  The ""endictment' of institutional abusers may be extended to a wider sphere than that focused on in this film. The public needs to be aware of such situations, so it can act (and vote) more responsibly. This is a superior production, with astonishing performances by the youthful cast, and headed by a powerful Henry Czerny in the lead role. should be viewed in this manner, on separate days, to allow the emotions to seep in.

Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock were absolutely hilarious, and David Alan Grier was good as well. The film is not to be taken to seriously, and although not at the caliber of Murphy favs of mine ""coming to America"" and "" beverly hills cop"", Boomerang is still a must-see for any Eddie Murphy fan. 8/10 just couldn't come off that way if she tried. There are some wonderful comic bits contributed along the way by Grace Jones, Geoffrey Holder, Tisha Campbell, and the legendary Eartha Kitt, memorable as an aging cosmetics queen with the hots for Marcus.

With Babyface producing, this is another winning production from him.Boomerang solidifies Eddie Murphy's return to the king of comedy.

It has extra scenes of dialog, stronger sex and nudity, and a much better and less choppy ending. it even conveys a similar meaning. This movie is clever, raunchy, sexy and fun. It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly deserves a lot more credit than it is receiving here. When did film lovers become such humorless prudes? (And why did Friedkin insist that the DVD be released only in a fullscreen version? Why, why, why???) could feel the sexual tension jump out from the screen. The beautifully haunting song, ""Mystic Dream,"" by Loreena McKennitt fit the dark mood perfectly.  I still don't know why I love this movie; to borrow a line from the film, it must be ""hysterical blindness."" Go see this movie with a date, and have a great time together afterwards! yet another bloody car chase). ""Jade"" is an enjoyable film, with delightfully silly twists and over-the-top violence (come on, you know you want to see Angie Everhart get run over again), and is given some class from it's cast and director, but, in the end, proves itself to be a guilty pleasure that makes one feel more guilt than pleasure. Caruso's performance is very believable.  Richard Crenna is underrated and good here too.  Angie Everhart and Donna Murphy are pleasing to look at and also give good performances in smaller roles.

But if you would like to have a taste of Dominican culture and you aren't afraid to temporarily give up your Hollywood aesthetic, this film could be for you.  And Balbuena is funny as hell. with dollars. Many years before of the birth of this movie, Luisito Martí as Balbuena, was looking for his dreams in several local TV shows in his country. At the end of every sketch something happened and he couldn't reach New York... Nueva Yol. It so important to notice that for Dominican people New York is la like the Mecca!!! because it reflects what any Dominican would want that is to come to the U.S for ""el sueño Americano"". It's a good thing this movie was made it makes all of us the Dominicans very proud and we like it a whole lot. Just make sure you watch the movie and really understand what they are saying before saying anything. to take him to the promise land ""nueva yol"" (new york city). One of the phrases to convince him to go there is: In nuevayol you find five dollar bills growing in the streets. You will find many locations and culture from The Dominican Republic and some of the places where most of the dominican colony resides in New York very well. "	7.1	0
Sonic Outlaws (1995)	"film on the legal and ethical issues that surround the work of such groups as Negativland, EBN, the Tape Beatles, and John Oswald. It follows the issues raised by Negativland's infamous single ""U2"" and is of a format (musically and visually) that one would expect from people who have a collage aesthetic in creating art to comment on the media... is replaced by just a mundane documentary.Despite the fall off I can't help but recommend this film to anyone who creates, and who likes the mash up art that runs rampant on the Internet. You may not watch it more than once but some of the questions it raises will rattle around in your brain for a long time afterward. in a career breaking lawsuit are well documented. The whole film is presenting in the style of a noisy cut up, jumping back and forth between taped telephone calls and sonic distortion to the talking heads and archive footage. Anyone interested in sampling, copyright laws, media criticism, noise, or video art should put this one on their 'to see list' "	7.4	0
Down Periscope (1996)	"the Police Academy movies.  Being a former Navy vet myself, the language made sense to me and after watching a super serious thriller like ""U-571"" recently,  Down Periscope still kept within the framework of what is acceptable and believeable within the Navy.  If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it for pure entertainment and escapism. the crew of the Stingray. The excellent cast made for an even more enjoyable movie. I don't want to get into specifics about little things that may not have been correct because that would only serve to detract from what I feel is an excellent movie to enjoy for its entertainment. So sit back, relax and ""Let's kick this pig"" just don't care. As a merchant marine myself, I found that the overall feel of the movie, while not plausible, was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes.This is a VERY funny movie, a good family film, and, particularly if your a fan, lots of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness. why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? I'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature. as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters. "	6.1	0
From the Journals of Jean Seberg (1995)	"Though not making movies ourselves, we do much the same thing when we talk about films, books, records, works of art to our friends, co-workers, family, teachers, students.I'm not a professor, but if I were, & if this movie were a paper, I'd give it an A.  It's a damn good read, & well documented.  So to speak. our big stars?  Julia Roberts, who played a hooker to become famous.  Demi Moore, who is paid to reveal her fake breasts.  And about 8200 men. Calling this film politically correct or feminist simply allows the reviewer to ignore the facts that it presents. After seeing it, the viewer will never see film the same way again. Mark Rappaport is not after  and probably doesn't believe in  some kind of absolute ""truth"", some specific answer as to why Seberg's career and life ended the way they did, indeed he is willing to place some of the blame on the actress herself; he is interested in provoking discussion and thought, and in that he succeeds entirely. and somtimes intensely cynical socio-psychological support to the idea of the collective gaze. Really rich, really worth seeing. will of her own; she is tossed about by men, and yet here she speaks the words of her male creator, Mark Rappaport - but in the history of film, its ideologies and repressions.  As these go, it is funny, informative and full of interesting and perceptive connections, but there are too many blatant distortions to actually accept it. "	7.1	0
Man of the Year (1995)	all subscribe. When shadow and makeup no longer hide the truth, and beauty moves beyond the skin, the value that remains is how much you are loved and how much you love others.  And there you have it.  Enjoy the walk and the beautiful scenery, your life will likely not change, but you will smile in the end. the best interview I have ever seen. It's really funny, witty, and crude and I almost cried to see it end. Dirk Shafer did a wonderful job bringing what had to be the most thrilling adventure in his life to the independent screen. If you ever come across this film, watch it. It's interesting and at the same time entertaining. Shafer's experiences as a Playgirl model--personally, I'd love to know just how much of the movie was based on real events; the movie is so skillfully done, it's difficult to tell.  It has a subtle, intelligent humor all its own, and is, at times, quite touching (something other mockumentaries never get near).A fine piece of movie-making, well worth watching. no less charming and attractive than Shafer is.Is he real? Those two guys are so amazing that I'd love to think they're really a couple. So I loved the movie, but it left me a little unsettled, almost as if I'd watched a movie about my own life and left wondering how much of it was true. Odd, but wonderful. 	5.9	0
Neon Bible, The (1995)	"beautiful, melancholy and sad.  Davies' films are always so full of life and this is no exception.  No idea why this film gets a bad rap - hands down, one of the greatest films of the 1990s.  It's totally unique - it comes from nowhere.  Shots, colors, textures - all perfect. Everything.  Enjoy the ride. lately that I get a lot more out of indulging in the brain-stimulating alternative pastime of reading. After all, books are, on the whole, lots better than movies. Case in point...""The Neon Bible."" I still can't stop hoping that, one day, they'll make a movie version of ""Confederacy of Dunces."" But I bet that'll be inferior to the book, too. imagery of this film and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie. But having people interact and react this way and have them being farmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark. If you want to see true southern Americana, skip this movie and see Elia Kazan's *Wild River* instead... of conveying the impact of the varied events of his childhood upon David as he reflects upon them during his train ride. I can only imagine how maddening the movie must be for those who never read the book beforehand - in short, if the movie left you feeling dissatisfied, it is still worth your while to read the book. amusement (yes, it is a joke!). Thus in the middle of the film I couldn't help it any more and started laughing aloud (watching the scene of murder with storm, lightning and bushes beating furiously in the window) and went on till the END sign. The rest of crowd joined me with relief.Film highly recommended for use in laughter therapy. "	6.2	0

Birdcage, The (1996)	"full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances. I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's. And the sight of Gene Hackman in drag is something everyone must experience. 99 times better than the original. I barely laughed, and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie. And that coming from a person who usually hates remakes. This movie gives the original ""Birdcage"" a fresh new shine and transports the story into the 90's. Well made, on all accounts, I can't think of a single criticism! Hackman in that last scene...well, I don't want to give away anything.Half of the fun of this film is the verbal repartee between the characters, especially anything between Hank Azaria, Nathan Lane or Dianne Wiest.If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to just have fun and laugh the night away.  Enjoy it!!!My rating: 4 stars to go with it. I loved the whole Nathan being the Mom dinner scene. It was just too hard not to laugh. I am little surprised by the rating of 6.5. I think people should see this film and just have a good time with it. Trust me, it's just a fun movie and it's not offensive in any way.10/10 will please anyone with a sense of humour. I pity anyone who can't enjoy it, for whatever reason- homophobia, lack of intelligence, arrogance, narrow mindedness etc. I'll admit that originals are often better, but that doesn't stop this from being a film to be enjoyed. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh, happy watching!Louis Hartshorn, age 15 "	7.0	0
Shadows (Cienie) (1988)	the father's ghost a part of the plot. Director Jerzy Kaszubowski, who also wrote the script does an excellent job of integrating disparate elements into a coherent movie, and acting is excellent all around.

Gospa (1995)	weakling in conversation with the Franciscans while talking about Medjugorje, contradicts all the bishop's public appearances and statements which are well known regarding these events. A film which abuses the name of our Lady, which does not shy away from an incorrect and insulting presentation of the local bishop...does not merit the attention of the faithful.Stella Matunina, ora pro nobis. better if it was a Croation production with Croation actors speaking the language with subtitles.  And of course a better scriptwould have been good. The other thing the film should have mentioned but did not was that the supposed apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Medjougorje has not been approved by the Catholic Church and is still under investigation. into very deep karst caves mere walking distance from where the Virgin Mary appeared to the kids. If anything, she appeared to remind the Croatian people of monstrous evil they carried out in her name by murdering and committing genocide against Croatia's Serbian and Jewish communities. That should have been a key part of the film by providing historical context. to go to Medjugorje, this film would be an good way to prepare. For anyone who has been to Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to relive the experience. For anyone curious about Medjugorje, this film would be a good way to find out the place where the Greatest Lady on earth or in heaven is still appearing. conversion of hearts, return to the faith, repentance, prayer, towards her son, Jesus. The end result is getting closer to God, experiencing his love and return of faith. Our Lady leads us to him. Go to Medjugorje, you life will never be the same.

Bad Boys (1995)	it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay. and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10 fast-paced and comedy/action thriller. The witness to a murder (Tea Leoni) of one of Smith's best friends is also along for the frantic ride that is fun, clever and highly entertaining. Watch for then-NBA star John Salley in a great cameo as an imprisoned computer hacker. A rare winner from a sometimes trivial cinematic genre. 4 stars out of 5. mind are 48 HOURS, KINDERGARTEN COP, and another Michael Bay film, ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor, even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.  KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh, but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON, I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate. and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Os Bad Boys' ('The Bad Boys') 	6.8	0
Amazing Panda Adventure, The (1995)	"panda cub and the terrific scenery. There are very few movies that depict either pandas or the beautiful Chinese panda reserves. The movie also shows the American contribution to the preservation of the pandas; the Chinese government wasn't doing much at all until American naturalists got involved in the 70's.Kids will enjoy this and you crabby adults will survive it. their scenes are some incredibly stupid dialog. Just as insulting was a big scene near the end where the children physically fend off the adult poachers. Yeah, right. In between, we get the normal plug for New Age ""mountain spirits"" and the like.OVERALL - Entertaining but the kids in her are very annoying at times.....too annoying for a second viewing. they gain maturity and tolerance for each other of course.Like I said (a million times), I was shocked by the negative reviews/ratings I would see on the web, I mean I love films about human/animal relations; this film has heart and a little humor. And I think films like this one would enlists peoples' sympathies for the Giant Panda population. way the Tibetian people are portrayed - there's no evidence of the persecution they are under. The poachers are not scary or interesting as well. I grew tired of hearing the same bars of music over and over, and I grew tired of seeing the same shots over and over! I think even kids may be frustrated with this movie. a bad shot at trying. The panda, by the way, is a convincing and cute alternating use of a real cub and a realistic animatronic puppet. The settings are also lush and captures the feel of the moments situations.Regardless its shortcomings and weaknesses, THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE is nonetheless harmlessly entertaining. Rent it for the kids.Rating: *** out of 5. "	5.8	0
Basketball Diaries, The (1995)	"memories that I thought I had forgotten. I wish every young person was made to see this movie as it takes the fun and games out of even recreational drug use. Not even the strong survive. I give it two thumbs way up and my sincere thanks to Jim Carroll for fighting off his demons to write ""The Baasketball Diaries"". to watch them throw away their basketball careers and their lives. The part where Lewis is going through withdrawal is so real and horrible. And after he goes through all that pain, he throws it away and goes straight back to the drugs. This movie is so incredible, I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay depressing.  DiCaprio is brilliant.  Arnie from What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Richard from The Beach, and Jim Carroll from the Basketball Diaries are about Leo's deepest characters.  He is an excellent actor.  The scenes that get you the most are the withdrawal scenes, and everytime he confronts his mother in the movie. This movie deserves a 10 trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as 'The Basketball diaries' delivers.The amazing performance by DiCaprio, the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in, 'The basketball diaries' deserves a 9 out of 10. be a drug-addict, they're much more explicit, more dirty, much harder... DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph, 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER, plenty of different shades.

Awfully Big Adventure, An (1995)	"is in.  Georgina Cates is the real jewel here, with a combination of naivete and boldness, along with a girlish charm which makes Stella believable as well as pathetic. Not the greatest movie made but a well done, well cast piece of work by professionals with a sense of purpose.  See it!  But not for the children. have been the best performance of his career.  Their star, ""Perhaps the best Captain Hook ever,"" is played by Alan Rickman in yet another stellar performance.  This is a consistently entertaining but very, very cynical coming of age story.  Thus, it may not be for all tastes.  Nevertheless, I recommended it highly, 8 out of 10. more or less, most of the time? When pressed, he can deliver.If you like Grant and Rickman, you can't go wrong. If you like dark stories of behind-the-scenes theatre life, this is a good 'un for you. And young Ms. Cates, married to Skeet Ulrich gives a great performance, even if she had to lie her way into the part. This movie isn't a sweet coming of age story. It's a devastating account of a young woman's loss of innocence in a cruel world.I tend to really like the movies most people find too depressing. Like the ancient Greeks I find human tragedy the greatest form of emotional catharsis. If you are the same way I recommend this film highly. This movie veers from a sharp set of character studies of provincial theatre to a weird and twisted love story with a tragic resolution.  Aside from the main story, there are two lovely support roles for Prunella Scales and Peter Firth.  The one problem in the cast is Cates, whose background was in TV sitcom and it shows. "	6.0	0
Amateur (1994)	"so aptly illustrate; these are people perpetually on the outside looking in, and yet there's something about them with which you will be able to relate, as well as sympathize .  And that's part of Hartley's magic; making you realize, that in the end we're not so different from one another, after all.  I rate this one 7/10. fitting. This is due to the acting, as every movement and expression helps to build characters and relationships. Isabelle Huppert and Martin Donovan both do this perfectly, and the impact of the ending owes a lot to them. The odd 'staging' of the film may put off those expecting a more conventional thriller but open minded viewers will be rewarded. is also a very gentle R, with almost no profanity or nudity, in its sex crazed, porn sort of way.Many other IMDb people have given plot points, and either love or hate the presentation, but anyone who was not flat out hysterical when the ""hitman"" got shot, should stick to TV sitcoms. It was a pure Monty Python worthy moment!! dialogue, the clarity, AND the ironic absurdity.  The story was not meant to be reality-driven, but limited to the raison d'etre of Thomas and the other characters: as in a dream, but not. Discovering it was a marvelous channel-surfing accident.Now I must do a search on Hal Hartley.  Check out his portfolio, so to speak.  Rating 9/10. an engagingly offbeat take on the ""crime thriller"" genre. It is also perhaps the most quietly thoughtful handling of amnesia (not as a plot trick, but as a subject) you're ever likely to see. But be warned: Hartley's refreshingly non-mainstream, detached, minimalist style takes quite some getting used to, and the ending is needlessly downbeat.     (**1/2) "	7.0	0
Apollo 13 (1995)	film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.9/10 fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic. as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.You can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable. Good job. Hanks - and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are each superb in their roles.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that it encompasses so many parts and peoples, and appeals to so many, that by the last reel you feel that if they don't make it through, you have lost some of your closest friends.In short: a minor masterpiece. technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that present-day film-makers would concentrate on happy situations, like this one, instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we, the movie-going public, are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!! 	7.6	1
Rob Roy (1995)	"moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation. his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films. in the history of the Cinema, and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender, and sensual. truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.Poor vs. Rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :) but i think the writers used the word ""honour"" 1 too many times.The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win.All in all just shy of a classic. "	6.9	0
Batman Forever (1995)	"is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations.  Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor. Most people tend to lump this one in the 'lousy' section, it seems, but it was one of the biggest movies of '95 and a very faithful adaption overall. Now if they'd only release the director's cut this one worth seeing as he adds a lot of humor.  I see people complaining that this one isn't as dark as the first two.  I in no way see that as a handicap.  It seemed a bit more glorious, and Batman had a very good image, but still had the flashbacks of his parents' death.Great movie. moments. There definitely is not a ""Tim Burton"" feel to the movie, outside of the psyches of the characters. The humor his the right tempo and doesn't go totally on the stupid side as in the later BATMAN AND ROBIN. It is one movie that has a great opening and a great ending, like those good old James Bond films. (not just looking like it was filmed in a basement). Batmans toys were used and seen when needed...not just talked about like in other movies.Of all the Batman movies this is the one I find myself watching the most. It also has fantastic action without seeming wimped down. It is still safe for kids 10 and older. Well worth owning. Kidman's part is a little boring but that's okay I don't really care. The special effects were great, the crew did a wonderful job and I hope they make another movie ""Batman & Robin"". For all Batman fans, this movie should be on your list. Buy it or rent it, it's worth it. I give this movie a perfect 10. "	5.4	0
Belle de jour (1967)	"Critics Circle.Interesting side notes: Bunuel himself had a shoe fetish, which helps explain the numerous shots of Deneuve's beautifully clad feet throughout the film, and the fact that every time she goes shopping, she buys shoes. He also appears in the film in a cameo as a cafe patron, and in another scene his hands are shown loading a gun. undercuts its realities by blurring them with fantasy, it is also entirely possible that the film is not actually ""about"" anything except itself. Individuals who insist on clear-cut meanings and neatly wrapped conclusions will probably loathe it--but those prepared to accept the film on its own terms will find it a fascinating experience. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer what is in the box, or do we love the mystery?The name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on 'lady of the night', since Séverine only worked in the day; everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter Séverine's feverish imagination and you might see something else. seems determined to provoke. Provoke what? Where is that need creeping from? I love to meander through ""Belle de Jour"" allowing Luis Bunuel to have his fun. He deserves it.

French passion and though she's intentionally unreachable, she's always fully aware of how to manipulate the spell she's cast over you.

Just sit back and watch the characters play out their lives, you'll very soon be engrossed by it.It was an absolute delight to watch. Not for everyone maybe but definitely for me! actors, a great rare groove soundtrack that could fit into every Tarantino production, and some really good jokes too. ""Blue in the Face"" become a minor art house classic in Europe in the nineties, and one could wonder if this movie would have been the same ten years later in the times of anti-smoking laws and campaigns. Nice independent movie. Victor Argo and precious appearances of Lou Reed, Jim Jarmusch (as Bob, in my favorite sequence of the movie), John Lurie and Madonna, to name a few. Soundtrack by David Byrne only adds to the mix.´Blue in the Face´ cynically, cleverly and ironically chronicles the life and the history of Brooklyn, NY. Watch it, it´s independent cinema at its best. but MJ Fox is really funny.  The remainder of the cast are made up of real quality actors such as Victor Argo, Harvey Keitel and Giancarlo Esposito to name a few.Overall this is a light reward for watching the slighly heavier Smoke.  Both films are good in their own way but this is the most fun to watch. a much-in-the-gutter character Michael J. Fox, which is really funny. The film also includes some curiosities about Brooklyn, and works not only as a set of vignettes but also as an account of what's typical and traditional in that neighbourhood. It has some cool moments and some touching moments, but overall it's a movie to see and not to analyse. "	6.7	0
Canadian Bacon (1995)	"stuck to developing the real themes and satire of the film, which are what make it great.Anyway, despite some weak points, this film is a brilliant satire that contains a number of parts that are utterly hilarious. It did not fulfill its full potential, but it is not too far below perfect and the good parts are really, really good. arrogant/ignorant (take your pick) stereotypes of Canada.Truly, with every scathing review stating ""This movie is a waste of time as it makes obvious stabs at Canada. That country should be insulted and the joke gets old."" No, the joke only gets better with every American reviewer who doesn't get it, pushing it that much closer to a truly inspired masterpiece. Russians and their obsession with MTV and ""what's that other one?

Moore SCORES!!! ALL the clichés and satires are perfect on both sides of the border. what makes the film funny though...it is much like the actual relationship between the countries.For Canadians...hearing John Candy respond to the capital of Canada being Ottawa was priceless...""What do you think were stupid?"", hilarious. :)Also funny...the streets of Toronto being bare!!  Toronto is the 5th largest city in North America.  Suddenly...everyone disappears...Candy will be missed!  RIP John! should do more of these stories rather than his documentaries, because people can follow his stories better than his disjointed, rambling documentaries. Viewers who are offended by this are missing the picture; it's a looks at America's anxieties and obsessions, American politics, and it has some great comedic lines and characters. Steven Wright, Dan Aykroyd, and other comedians make cameos. "	5.9	0
Casper (1995)	other films, so I have no idea whether this whole thing was a fluke or whether everything just settled in to my particular sensibility, but even outside of the emotion I think the technical aspects, the giant basement set, are enough to keep interest. And even outside of that, the acting is terrific. Cathy Moriarty is an absolute riot. 7/10 really adored! i also liked the amazing effects, that were famous at its, time. Of course now, effects from movies are like The Matrix films and LOTR, but i mainly like this film, because it tocuhes my heart in a both sad and sometimes happy, knowing, someone else is out there for you, even if you are a bit...dead. 10/10 ultimately special. The magic of Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci as well as that of director Brad Silberling, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and other producers weaves between each and every scene to eventually lift us off our feet. Above all, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Casper is my all time favourite character. Truly fantastic. You won't BOOlieve it until you see it. a movie. an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching, warm-hearted, humorous, sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note, it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family & Casper & Sleepy Hollow & see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel. 	6.1	0
Clockers (1995)	could say more about the film, but I encourage you to just see it, along with the rest of Spike's oeuvre.  He's not a perfect filmmaker, and some of his best films are marred by elements that don't work, but I feel his consistency in terms of delivering brilliance is not below most of the cinema's most celebrated auteurs. and emotional brutality. And it may have been a bit too stylized for the Saturday night drive-in set wanting a brainless shoot 'em up; but for  those interested in quality film making on a hugely important issue that also functions as an engaging who done it, Spike Lee does it up royal in this, perhaps Lee's most, accessible film. to help the mood.This is a good example of the lack of options that exist in the ghetto and, besides some very obvious preaching, it makes it's point without shouting it at the audience. The only failing is that Lee bottles it near the end, delivering a sentimental ending of hope that is unfortunately not the truth in many cases. gallows humor to psychologically deal with this culture of depravity.  What's fascinating about CLOCKERS is Lee's willingness-and guts-to present Klein, despite his prejudice, as the film's hero.  Lee understands that casual racism is simply endemic and inescapable in American culture.  What he appreciates is Klein's ability to transcend his own prejudice and finally do the right thing. in fact is grew steadily throughout the film. The images of dead bodies shown at the beginning made a strong starting point, and served as an immediate reminder that the themes dealt with in the film are occurring all the time.On a side note, I thought the resemblance of Shorty's game 'Gansta' to today's GTA: San Andreas was pretty funny. 	6.9	0
Congo (1995)	"""Congo"" is an entertaining but outdated jungle adventure movie in the style of Tarzan, with lost city, dangerous gorillas and forgotten tribe of natives. The screenplay does not develop well the relationship among Charles Travis, his apparently estranged father R.B. Travis and Dr. Karen Ross but the film works on a rainy Saturday afternoon. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Congo"" belong to that audience.  Congo and movies like it are cartoons for adults: if you don't like movies with colorful visuals, ridiculous plots and juvenile characters, you should not watch Congo.  But if you do like movies with those characteristics, then I submit that Congo is one of the best movies of that kind that I've ever seen. scene without being excited by the action, or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.So, check your ego and check your critical faculties; this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it, by my estimation, have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies. pretty decent movie. I thought the story was good. It's not Jurassic Park, but it's Michael Crichton. Congo wasn't very realistic, but neither was Jurassic Park. It was like that show ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" with intelligent gorillas and science. There was action and a plot. So I could sit and watch it. I'll give it (barely) 6 stars. by psychopathic gorillas never gets old.If you've got friends over, pop this one in and give it the MST3K treatment, you'll have a blast I'm sure.Like I said, no redeeming value to be had here but if you like watching bad movies just for the heck of it, this may be one to check out.P.S.

CRIMSON TIDE is an entertaining and challenging film that, along with films like THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and DAS BOOT, may set the high water mark (forgive the pun) for the genre.  9/10. and real. More than just a cautionary tale, this is a very human drama about who people become under extreme conditions, and how they work out problems to reach solutions, or fail to do so. If that final sentence sounds cryptic, then let it entice you to see the film so you can figure out what I mean for yourself. better films Bruckheimer ever produced. While the story was completely plot-driven and the performances a little over the top, the rivalry between Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman made this film a cut above the rest of the trash Bruckheimer tends to produce. While simple and direct, it proves to be effective in the annals of storytelling, never overindulging the viewer. very start of the film set the perfect tone. The entire film is in a way scary by making us wonder if what would happen in a situation like this, and how could the military establish proper operating procedures for it. However, the message at the end of the film re-establishes some hope. 9/10, and I love the creative title. Steve Zahn, James Gandolfini, Rick Schroeder, George Dzundza) must decide which of the all-world performers they are going to side with. The screenplay is mediocre really, but Hackman and Washington know how to overcome that and director Tony Scott keeps the pulse of his audience in high over-drive. Definitely an acceptable piece from the genre. 4 stars out of 5. 	7.3	0
Crumb (1994)	stark relief. One gets the impression that if Robert had not escaped, he'd have wound up suffering just as much as Charles and Maxon, possibly even more. This isn't easy viewing and the subjects are undeniably resistable, but it does offer a unique and enlightening glimpse into the reality of the old cliché about genius and madness walking hand-in-hand. Recommended. lives in France because its culture is `slightly less evil than the United States'.The film is embarrassingly candid about unhappy details of Crumb's life, such as his brothers' mental illness, experiments with drugs and ambivalent attitudes towards women.  Yet it is apparent that there is no misery or violence in this man  it's all on paper. (Rating: A) of the sexes, a case history of mental illness, psychotic families, whatever.  The story, and with it the film, is amazing and totally captivating.  I have watched it many times and intend to watch it many times over.  Give it a miss only if you expect some good, clean, family entertainment, but do so at your loss. the subject. I wonder why Zwigoff made no mention of Crumb's Cheap Suit Serenaders band.Crumb comments against the crass commercialism of America. And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.Crumb, the movie, is a crazy world of contradictions and well worth the ride. nearly psychotic family. Compared to the world, R. Crumb is a sexual deviant, a lunatic genius, and a perfect candidate to be taken away in a plain white van.  Compared to his family, R.

Desperado (1995)	movie that really needs no story and basically there isn't really any. All the fun characters, dialog and action sequences make you forget that there isn't really a story. The Quentin Tarantino cameo is especially entertaining and so are almost every Mexican bad guy that are all in one way or another over the top.A must see, in my opinion.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ de Almeida and Danny Trejo.Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie. smouldering just beneath the surface.The stunts and effects were first rate and extremely entertaining.Even the extras did great work.I would recommend this film to anyone who is wanting some great entertainment.Mark me don't go looking for some Oscar winning dramatic performances.But it is fun,pure unadulterated fun.Also the photography is absolutely first rate.As is the almost Kubrickesque atmosphere of the film.Ydnar yet completely Rodriguez. He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own. Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection. Grade: ***** out of ***** Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be. 	7.2	0
Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)	solidly enjoyable detective story with all the twists and turns that you could expect from that genre.  However it also benefits from a great sense of place and time that is all though the film  not merely painted on with sets or soundtrack.  A class act from Washington and others just adds to the feeling of quality. even detect the smells, too. Washington's aces, of course, as usual; makes you wonder if he'll do any more adaptations of Walter Mosley books starring Easy Rawlins. He's aided by a very good supporting cast, including Beals and Tom Sizemore (playing a heavy, surprise surprise!). Fans of Washington should watch this, but really anyone who likes film noir will approve. film 'L.A. Confidential' my problem with it was that a lot of black characters where being brutalised, without any chance to fight back. In this film they fight back. We have a black hero, someone who is as smart anyone else and in some cases smarter.I hope that one day someone will film the rest of the Easy' Rawlins books. work WWII vet(Denzel Washington)is trapped in a web of lies, backstabbing and flying lead when he agrees to look for a politician's girlfriend(Jennifer Beals). Some real good movie music by the likes of Memphis Slim, Duke Ellington, Roy Brown and Jimmy Witherspoon. Very apt support from:Tom Sizemore, Don Cheadle and Lisa Nicole Carson. One steamy sex scene scorches and redeems. males view point and this makes the film very interesting to watch. No more all-white worlds of the 40's generation. This film shows both sides of the coin, and doesn't end up with a chip on both shoulders.The film may be a tad predictable, but this should not deter you. This film is underrated and deserves your attention. Very entertaining. 	6.7	0

Multiple car scenes a cool scene on a boat, and loads and loads of gold thrown in for an exciting ride. Irons is great as the villain, as was Rickman in the first one. Truly this is one fast moving ride that will keep you well entertained throughout. rest of the action is magnificent, particularly a car ""chase"" through the streets of New York which is as unstaged as a car chase can possibly look.  The film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last.  Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an action flick that has it all. mad and/or megalomaniacal. It's also interesting that the resolution is reached on foreign ground.But the subtexts in Die Hard: With a Vengeance may be even more minor focuses than in the previous two films. Instead the focus is on the spectacle of a tightly told, thrilling action/adventure story. That's all the film needs to succeed as well as it does. a good thing. Who wants the same thing three times in a row? The plot has as many twists and turns as a snake, and the movie keeps the viewer involved. Watching Zeus and McClane bicker is amusing as well. Samuel L. Jackson pulls off the role of the ""racist black man"" very well. I would highly recommend this movie. "	7.6	1
Doom Generation, The (1995)	taking, tough as nails lead character, James Duval is Amy's naive, stoner boyfriend Jordan White, and Johnathon Schaech was Xavier Red, the crazy, dangerous, kinky, and violent source of trouble. If you have a strong stomach, and don't mind harshly sad endings, check it out, but be aware, because you might get grossed out and leave (I almost did). 9/10 moments of suspense. In fact, the film's gory and discomforting climactic scene is perhaps the artistic highlight and suggests some real filmaking talent by writer/director Gregg Araki. This is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but is worth a look for those who like a film which challenges them to react to strong imagery and who don't mind transgressive depictions. culture generation. Heck, even his colorful slang  which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms  alone is worth the effort. The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years. Check it out if you're open-minded, not quickly offended and not faint of heart! of all the product placement, but we are not supposed to give in to this commercialism.  Giving into this wasteland of over-marketed products is what Gen-X'ers say that they will not do while wearing their $60 Tommy pants and sipping on a $6.00 latte. Araki does what any brilliant director would do in this situation: make THE DOOM GENERATION. murder, drugs, sex (Highly un-erotic), ya know, the usual. The dreamy, surreal visuals are a delight, and the symbollic use of colours and light are mind-blowing if not hypnotic. Please dont be disgusted, during the first viewing, instead look between the lines, where you will find the truth. I highly recommend this film to anyone who like to ask 'why?'. 	6.0	0
Feast of July (1995)	"don't get any better than this. I caught my breath a couple of times and may have moaned! Embeth Davis and Ben Chaplin were beautiful together. Simply beautiful throughout the film.It's a very well-told story that seemed so real-to-life. It's still timely, or should I say ""timeless"". If you like historical romance and period pieces, don't miss it. It's lovely. hilarity, and he simply fell out of any serious reading list. Thoroughly recommend these two novels as they paint an authentic picture of people with real feelings and genuine jealousies and mistrust. Perhaps it is this characterisation that has been soundly transformed into a visual experience that makes `Feast of July' a thoroughly recommendable film. Near 7 out of 10. sons changing their lives forever. The film offers good performances by all, represents rural life of the time well, is artfully presented, and avoids extreme excursions giving the film a sort of perfect Disney-esque feel. Davidtz graces the screen throughout though Chaplin offers perhaps the best performance. A good watch for those in need of some easy-going romantic period drama. neurotic young peasant man, adorned with England last century background. The movie goes on swiftly, although the first part is a little slow and heavy handed by the direction. Chaplin and Davitz are good in the lead roles and the climax (the last scene, to be exact)cause a strong and impressive impact on the viewer. I give this a six. Chaplin still lights up the screen.

The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply . great music. To me, this is some of the best entertainment! The kind of entertainment that cinema was invented for and that was so successful in the 40s and 50s. It seems to me that people today just can't enjoy that kind of entertainment anymore. And that is sad! So, please, stop complaining and just enjoy for Pete's sake! (lol!) three love each other (in different ways.)All this said, it isn't the greatest movie despite some excellent acting - the movie had a weak plot and Maligant is not a very convincing villain. But, if you're bored, home sick, or just want to watch some light entertainment, by all means watch this film - just don't expect Peter Jackson quality. been told many times on film within the past century, and has almost always been presented as a tragic event in an otherwise idyllic time. Why does he insist on tarnishing this telling by citing irrelevant facts? Do not be influenced by his trash. This is simply a wonderful, new twist on an old story, and it's very well done.Enjoy! have read Thomas Malory you have some idea on how this will end. But in the case of this particular film, not completely.First Knight is not first by any means in Camelot films. But it's enjoyable enough for the fans of the leads.

Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)	A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios. A nice message for young audience that you must always think about defending the wild nature and what in real life there are more important things than money.My vote 8,2 out of 10 or between B+ and A-. the first movie in the fact that it shows willy with his family, it shows orcas in a pod, and it shows their relationship as a family. How sweet! Willy is a very sociable whale. If you want the excitement and thrilling adventure that you got in the first movie, check this one out asap. Safe for the entire family! film, yet it's really hard to spot in most scenes due to the rather seamless effect. The story is shallow, predictable, but actually quite believable, although the Jessie-Elvis brotherhood is something that can easily be removed without doing any harm to the story. As family entertainment, I at least give it a fair and easy recommendation.Rating: *** out of 5. is too young, he then runs away and then comes back. Things become eveen worse when fire spreads with the oil still, in the sea, nadean and elvis are rescued but jesse loses grip of holding onto the ladders, Willy saves him by going under the flames and bringing him to safety. I give this movie 10 out of 10. action still make superior family viewing for those with kids 10-14 range. 	5.0	0
Hackers (1995)	"some to much fame. And the soundtracks are absolutely AMAZING!! I own them and listen regularly... This should probably rate a four or five, but I can't help but ignore all critics and pronounce myself as one of the large cult following of adorers of this film. For fun value, let alone the fact that it's entertaining as hell: 8/10. It is the development of characters the build up of a plot and an exciting climax and satisfying denouement. In closing, don't expect a command line prompt or a true UNIX client on any of the systems because it just doesn't happen in movies. Instead watch the movie because its exciting, fun and a great throwback to the early 90's. OK, the soundtrack is great and it changes for the everlasting ""chliché"" of the IT Nerd.It's a movie that could surprise you, especially with the amount of bad movies being released nowadays. It's funny to see Johnny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie at the beginning of their careers as well. If you're looking for light entertainment for one evening, ... in her role. Other than that, this movie was a good movie and it shouldn't be bashed because it depicts people, technology, and life inaccurately. What movie ever does? I'm from Iowa and do you think movies depict  Iowan's lives exactly the way they are? No. But I'm not out to fertilize the lawn with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". of course, Lorraine Bracco went on to THE SOPRANOS, as the Mafia's favorite 'shrink' (with the possible exception of Billy Crystal). So, if you skip over the dated attempt to be 'cutting edge', and just sit back and enjoy the performances, HACKERS is a fun movie that can be appreciated as a 'Preview of Coming Attractions' from a remarkable cast...

All in all, Jeffrey is fun and worth an hour or so of your life. get it. It is both painful and joyful at turns watching the character navigate through a turning point in his life. I laughed, I got choked up, and then I laughed again, and again ad infinitum. This is not a ""gay"" movie. It's a character driven story that we can all identify with, if our minds and hearts are open. with the surprise cameo appearances by some of today's best actors. Patrick Stewart gives an outstanding performance as ""Sterling,"" however, it is Michael T. Weiss who steals the show! Not only does he look incredible in white spandex, but his performance is incredibly believable. Whether you are a Weiss fan or not, this movie is a must see! Lanie, NY time just star spotting!I found this so hilariously funny in some scenes, and yet full of pathos in others that I ended up laughing & crying at the same time. In the end I just had to buy it, so I can watch it as often as I want. Be broadminded, and give this film a go... it won't disappoint. I found it fun, light-hearted and adorable.  Michael Weiss is yummy as usual, Patrick Stewart adds flair and finesse, Nathan Lane gives yet another spunky fun performance, etc..

Johnny Mnemonic (1995)	the way there are some colorful characters, cool gadgets and cityscapes from Gibson's 2021, and even a smidgen of romance (but not enough to bother anyone). I mean what's the problem!?! The movie is very faithful to Gibson's vision and even asks the main character to wrestle with an ethical dilemma or two while all the action is going on... him in the role. Gibson's writing is so descriptive, that a screenplay should follow the story as literally as possible.  Ideally, I think that Johnny Mnemonic would work out as a short film, something no longer than an hour. It is a short story after all, and adding filler to extend the time certainly didn't work the first time. could tell he didn't like this movie very much. Overall, its a very interesting sci-fi flick which has its ups and downs. The upsides is the setting, the music, the vision of the future etc. etc. while the downsides are Keanu Reeve's acting and sometimes lack of interest in what happens next in the movie. I give it a 7/10. no substitute. Incidentally, many of these props appear cliched, but remember that Gibson more or less invented them; it's merely that this film appeared long after they had become standard movie fixtures.Gibson's written work has fairly sparse dialogue, and makes heavy use of precise and rather introspective visual description to convey character. Perhaps this just doesn't translate well to film. crazy preacher was so hilarious to behold. A nice and funny mirror to the numerous fundamentalistic Christians in the American society. And, of course, some nice fighting scenes, cool hi-tech equipment, and a gorgeous Dina Meyer, all packed in a futuristic ambience.

If this review peaks your interest, see it! do whenever I view this movie.  There are many quotable lines, which I enjoy reciting.  ""Judge Dredd"" is not a deeply intelligent, insightful film.  But it makes a great popcorn flick!  This upbeat, funny, nonstop entertainment is a real treat for me to watch over and over again.  My score:  8 (out of 10) even if a few actors barely get enough screen time (like Lane and Joan Chen, who plays semi-villain Ilsa), and the premise is captivating. It's too bad this film gets unduly knocked by purists and those misguidedly looking for detail realism in the genre. Judge Dredd is severely underrated on IMDb. It deserves a first look or a second chance. in a good way. I also loved the giant robot in the film.

Jury Duty (1995)	than the other jurors. Anyway as time progresses, it appears that Shore might be on to something when he tries to convince the others that the case is not as cut-and-dried as it appears. Some outstanding performers (most notably Shelley Winters, Charles Napier, Tia Carrere and Stanley Tucci) somehow found their way on this downer. 2 stars out of 5. in my life.  Who on earth spent money on this piece of junk.  Whoever they are I am sure they are regretting it.  I am not a Pauly Shore basher, I really liked Son In Law, but this movie is worthless.  Do not see it, I'd say burn it and put it out of its misery. good actress also. It's a true comedy if you think about it, stupid, funny, there's only one part of the film that I didn't find funny. I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Pauly Shore's mother runs the comedy circuit, so that's pretty funny in itself. Did he get on the big screen just by talent. You be the judge:) and Sean Whalen.So why all the negative reviews? It is such a stupid story, so stupid that it is funny. And it is Pauley Shore, doing what Pauley Shore does best, acting like a total nut and having a blast doing it. For a load of laughs and a waste of some time, Jury Duty is not a bad choice. I have to give him credit.  I mean, here is another guy whose movies were successful at the box office, but had little or nothing to show for it. If you are a fan of Pauly, I doubt you will be disappointed.  Others beware, for JURY DUTY will be a real trial to sit through.1 out of 5 	4.1	0

There is also one or two funny moments, very very well placed. Of course, to fully appreciate the movie, you must watch the directors cut, with a couple extra scenes, that actually add a lot to the plotline, and the surreality of it all. Great stuff Clive! would call entertaining, I would say the visual effects were quality work. Certainly the gore factor was quite high, but someone did an impressive job with what is called morphing.And Daniel von Bargen did an outstanding job as the very frightening Nix. I did not like the character at all, but one has to be impressed with the talent shown. "	6.1	0
Love & Human Remains (1993)	"metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (""finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond. for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone. to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember. of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over. the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes.

Mad Love (1995)	"is not solid. The flux is very fluid within this story. The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris, and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line.I actually enjoyed this, though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :. with the maniac depressive Casey that has arrived from Chicago. When she is interned in an institution, he believes that her family is unfair with the girl. But when he realizes that her mental illness is serious and dangerous, he contacts her family and they find the solution for her treatment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amor Louco"" (""Mad Love"") that might be found in a movie, opting for some different ways of illustrating their relationship. The two main characters are well portrayed, and believable. I think Barrymore and O'Donnell hold together something that may not have great elements like soundtrack, plot originality etc, because despite the fact that Drew's eyebrows really annoyed me, they both did a good job. I payed a lot more attention to the movie itself and saw that it did have delight, great acting talent and other positive notes. As well as this, the directing was fine and there were some really good shots through the characters' road trip in the movie. This is one interesting picture. A must-see! Rating: Three out of Five stars. properly portray such a mental illness without it. I also don't think a movie dealing with mental illness to this depth should be rated R. I love that this film showed that those of us with mental illness are people too. We too have feelings. I wish I'd watched it sooner rather than just assuming I'd probably not like it. "	5.3	0
Mallrats (1995)	mall law), and a bigger involvement of Jay and Bob (but not too much) make this as good, if not better than the other Kevin Smith films and quite possibly my favourite of his.Its hard to rate this film, you'll either really like it and give it a 10 or tuck into another chocolate pretzel after giving it a 1. in their own little subplot of taking on the mall police.  Again their adventures are exaggerated for humour.If you hated Clerks and Smith's other movies then you'll hate this. However if this world is one that appeals to you then you'll love this movie's reckless abandonment of reality and enjoy the adventures involved in a trip to the mall. this movie is a awfully funny experience. But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort... which is exactly what must be changed. ill let you find out how.jay and silent bob make a welcome comeback in a slightly more central role with a lot more to do. with hilarious results.i originally put 8 for this movie. but thinking about it again its a 10 and its going in my movies :) l8er days PaUl :) of himself.I liked the script and the way that the movie was paced, although at times seemed like the scenes were stretched further than they should be. The sets were good and the lighting and cinematography is good also. I don't really have any major gripes about this film, it's just that, there are better movies in Kevin Smith's series. 	7.2	0
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995)	"for everyone but, Power Rangers was never meant for adults. Simply, children. If it was for adults I'd say hell yeah, a 2 is out of remorse, but since i remember the good old days. I'm giving this movie a 5 because yes, there is much better movies, but this movie is good for its purpose. Or at least was. do back flips, yet could say their lines perfectly without sounding out of breath. Also how they replaced certain rangers with people who looked like they were picked out of a kick ball team line. But Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is a classic film I think in a sense and will be a true time capsule of 1995.10/10 quite funny to see them talking with their fists all of the time no matter the context and the different fashion back then. How often do we see teenagers dressed with their shirts tucked into their jeans with a nice brown leather belt? Ha ha ha. I thought this movie was great for a laugh. POWER RANGERS ON DVD??? WOW!!! about 9 remakes of the characters. I think that a lot of people that were children when this came out would agree here. Not to mention the film had an amazing soundtrack. All in all for a children's film i think that this film was worth the money and i suggest this movie for the newer generation of children too! TV show. Of all of these actors, only Johnson has gone on to some fame (on TV's ""Felicity""). ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" has better special effects than on the show and in ""Turbo"", and that helps alot. This is one odd picture. It ain't all that good, but it's not all that bad either. **1/2 (out of four) "	5.2	0
Moonlight and Valentino (1995)	go into too many details but this is a must watch movie and not a perfect 10 but pretty darn good. I cannot believe that this has under a 6 rating not true at all. So i have to add a few more lines. OK then vote for this movie with your heart not from a spectacularly sensational Hollywood standpoint. movie did! Elizabeth Perkins did a superb job of pulling off the part of the wife struggling to come to terms with her husbands death. The scene near the end of the movie where she finally broke down was a piece of brilliance on her behalf. Surrounded by three other popular actresses she shines through!I'm glad I watched it! 7/10. gets right into the healing process with humor, charm, and sensitivity while exploring the principal's relationships and not lingering too long on the central grief issue. Overall, an entertaining piece which, IMHO, was scored too low by IMDB.com users because of the male side of the jury. Recommended for more mature audiences... and Ebert, wake up and smell the roses. one of his first movies. I thought he was very good as well as irresistable as The Painter. But then I got into the movie and enjoyed the interaction between the women played very well by Elizabeth Perkins, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathleen Turner and Gwyneth Paltrow. Altho a female I am not usually into chick flicks but this was worth seeing. didn't quite understand if abortion was a topic here...It seemed like it during the last segment. Does anybody have a clue? That's the only thing I hate; When they don't make it all the way clear in the movie then you know they could've improved. If you want to see some good acting see this movie. Elizabeth Perkins is gorgeous! 	5.8	0
Mute Witness (1994)	"in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well-done (the ""Director"" should've asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio). This movie didn't let up since the opening scene... nerve wrecking tension comes from suggestion or chases and less from graphic violence, which one would expect from a film of that genre and plot. Apart from Alec Guinness' guest appearance, no big names, which only makes the film more attractive. I would be surprised if ""Mute Witness"" hasn't got cult status by now among the fans of the genre. the movie's pace and tone that I find it hard to believe he'd suddenly undo all his solid work in an instant. But the film's downward spiral is entirely his fault, the man wrote and directed the picture. He should have just stuck with what worked. But the first 2/3's are so much fun, it's worth recommending to thriller fans. her life and both of them will wear you out. The first I described above. The second scene, the climactic one, goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit but, overall, since it's so good at keeping our attention, then it served its purpose as entertainment. combines thriller and horror with black humor in a plot with many twists. The director Anthony Waller masterly raises tension and relieves with black humor, startling the viewer and then making him or her laugh. Unfortunately the conclusion is a little disappointing but it is worthwhile watching this wonderful little film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Testemunha Muda"" (""Mute Witness"") "	6.8	0

Net, The (1995)	The premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.To make a long review short...oops! Too late! If you enjoy Sandra Bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time, take a look at this little gem. You won't be disappointed. :-) the story is greatly paced and exciting enough to increase your pulse rate to rapid highs. The computer mess is the biggest fuss some viewers will have in common, including all those not used to this new style. A good shot at a modernization of mystery-suspense films, but you know exactly what to predict here. Why the new TV series? at the real Moscone Center, she desperately tries to copy all the computer files before the bad guys get her. Pretty tense, but if she had been smart, she could have gone to The San Francisco Chronicle office, which is a block down the street from the Moscone Center.But hey, maybe the Chronicle doesn't have high enough walkways out back. deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade. is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.This movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error. 	5.9	0
Nine Months (1995)	"requires thought or is deep and meaningful in any way, but if you want a giggle, then Nine Months will definitely put a smile on your face. It did mine! The only downside is perhaps having such high profile stars in not very challenging roles. Aside from this, Nine Months is a light hearted comedy that really got me laughing. forced.While things are a little light and slow in the beginning, it's in the last half hour that the writer puts a little too many comedy, most of it falling flat on its 'face'. With a cast like this, one would have expected better. I'd still say it's far more enjoyable than the likes of 'Runaway Bride' and 'Pretty Woman'. obvious.The central characters are simplistic and are black & white (she all good, he all bad). The dialog is from the day dreams of a fourteen year old.The fact that a film uses actor Hugh Grant does not make it sensitive, uplifting or funny. The fact that a film contains sex and slapstick does not make it a romantic comedy. a toy store; Julianne Moore's wheelchair plowing into a wall; etc.)Why can't there ever be a movie where someone who doesn't want children at the beginning STILL doesn't want them at the end? Why is ""I don't want to be a parent"" seen as a character flaw to be overcome, rather than a personal insight to be trusted?Lame, lame, lame. having the last laugh as the movie ended up being a mild box office success. That does not change the fact that the production is a pretty big mess from top to bottom. ""Nine Months"" goes for laughs and gets deflated very quickly. The little drama pinched in feels forced and never does become apparent. 2 stars out of 5. "	5.5	0
Party Girl (1995)	"The public library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students. It also breaks many librarian stereotypes. Librarians might even be capable of having fun -- even if they don't *usually* have sex in the romance languages section! (The best movie about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.) an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message.  This movie is FUN.  It's pretty dated, almost passe, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable.  If you want to be charmed by a 90's Breakfast at Tiffany's, attended 90's raves, or love Parker, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, don't bother. of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). Like ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. Still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone! for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem.I especially liked the Diaz character (reminded me of every single struggling DJ I've ever known). And many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it.Babaganoosh! in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way.Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good. "	6.6	0
Prophecy, The (1995)	The theological side of the story is much more interesting than angels being fluffy creatures most people believe in, and are closer to the angels described in older scripts and texts.

And his role in this film is one that epitomizes convolution. He is awesome.This film is one that should not be missed. If you don't understand everything about it the first time, watch it again and again. You'll learn something new every time. And you'll enjoy it more and more. This is one hell of a film!! wars in heaven, and now has only his duty to sustain him. Elias Koteas brings real feeling to a role that could have been cookie-cutter--the once-almost-priest who now must save the world from evil. And Viggo Mortensen, in his brief on-screen time as Lucifer, is absolutely electrifying in showing that the dark angel is indeed the most beautiful of all. franchise, with mixed results following each subsequent sequel. But it's here where it matters, a fine film that deserves far better than the bad reputation it gets from those who expected a straight out horror film. I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a go, open your mind and hope Gabriel doesn't come a wandering in. 8/10 is not exactly a given thing in a movie like this.I guess this would by many people be called a b-movie. But i think the original plot and the acting lifts this quite a few notches. So watch this for something quite unique, but please stay away from the sequels that are not worth your trouble. I rate this 6/10. 	6.5	0
Reckless (1995)	"For me, the film exploresidentity in the same ways as his earlier film, prelude to a kiss....and perhaps also explores issues related to HIV/AIDS, much like his earlier two films. This is NOT the stage play, like any film of previously written material it illustrates the directors point of view. I highly recommend this film, it's a rare delight W Stephen Dorff was in it. Even though his part was very small I was glad that it brought me to the movie in the first place. I have to say that I'm happy to see that they are turning the movie into a Broadway play with Mary Louise Parker in the cast. I think it will be a must see. you love movies, if you care about and are interested in movies as an art form, you will want to see this movie.It's incredibly funny, it's beautiful, it's strange, it's wearying. It's not for everyone, but I wouldn't want to be everyone. If you're thoughtful, intelligent, and patient, you will appreciate the superb acting, film-making, and atmosphere this film provides. slightly more absurd. For anyone who has had experience with mental health practitioners, who couldn't relate to the parade of therapists projecting their own issues onto Rachel's character, and then validating themselves for helping her? Yes, overall ""Reckless"" is a sad story but its quirky comedic elements give it enough spice to make it a satisfying if not guilty pleasure. is entirely different from anything else and that will make an indelible impression, would do well to see this film. And don't worry, the script is just fine; although it is a morality tale, it is not a morality tale with a smug or pat conclusion, as it ends, as it begins, with a weirdly satisfying sort of open-ended grace.

Safe (1995)	"it?The film doesn't offer solutions- only one of the most frightening, eerie, and numbing indictments of suburbia and the New Age that I have ever seen.  It puts its images, sets, sounds, actors into a collective vision of decay, expressed through the decline of the model suburban housewife.  See it, but don't look for answers or happy endings. to end by reiterating what is possibly the film's main strength - the presence of Julianne Moore. This truly is a captivating performance from her, and certainly one of the most astonishing I am likely ever to see. 'Safe' gives us the chance to watch this gifted actress in one of her most underrated, little seen, yet most remarkable roles. does indeed have a face and a heart.  She does indeed exist.  I think that's what Todd Haynes' message to us is.  SAFE is a cry for us to take a good, hard look at the world around us, to recognize its variety of poisons, and to make a stand to save it and to save ourselves. three of the most striking, haunting images I've seen in the past half decade in film.Someone else compared it to ""Dead Ringers"", and this is apt in many ways, though the subject matter is less perverse.  ""Safe"" shares a similar aesthetic both in the distance the director takes from the narrative and some matters of style.Recommended for the daring. thriller  as Carol doesn't know what triggers her symptoms, the audience never knows when she'll have another attack.While Haymes criticises the New Age belief that illness is psychologically-based, in Carol's case, it's impossible to separate the psychological and physical aspects of her illness. The cinematography shows her dwarfed by her environment and Haymes offers no easy solutions. ***½/***** stars. "	7.2	0

Showgirls (1995)	I recommend it? I don't know. It depends on your taste. If you're looking for a drama, go elsewhere.

It might surprise you. style as a wannabe Vegas showqueen.I think compared to a lot of films that come out that deserve a one star rating this doesn't deserve one, I found it watchable and I think there's been a kind of herd effect to say it's trash. It's just *about* trash.So right on Tarantino for coming out alone in praising it I say. so many clichés in here, but you kinda don't think about them as most of the time your wondering if you just saw what you just SAW. And the one liners are just awesome.This may not be a master piece, its far from it. but this show just how great some bad tasting movies can be the most pleasurable experience. for Elizabeth Berkley since this movie probably ruined her career. Still, I think we should all give her another chance. She's worth it. Don't all our Saved By the Bell loyalties mean anything? I want to close by saying that I am proud to own this movie in my personal video collection. It is a cult classic in the making!!! and direction and big glitzy production numbers and the recipe for a disaster of legendary proportions was the result.Sit back, have a glass of champagne, get ready to toss your fries and sit back and enjoy.

Smoke (1995)	"chance occurrences. The characters are not ""movie colorful"", but ordinary down-to-earth people brought to realization by a flawless ensemble cast. The film reaches a sublime conclusion in a tender Christmas story narrated by Keitel and supported by Tom Waits' haunting song ""Innocent When You Dream"". Everyone ends up in a better place than when they started, including myself as viewer. It gives us an opportunity for a stop and for starting rethinking issues. Therefore the small cigar shop, which appears like an island within a stormy ocean, like the antipode to the bustle environment.Sometimes some of the hurry enters the shop, but the clocks seem to tick differently there and at the end everything calms down. I like this movie. Whittaker, and all the other players  contribute some of their finest performances.The film itself ends with a ""Christmas story' which conveys more of the religious-and humanist-meaning of that holiday than a thousand scmaltzy TV specials.Watch this movie, watch it carefully. Rarely has the beauty and sublimity concealed behind the facade of quotidian existence been better conveyed in a film. is just the little things - a chat with your friend, a moment of happiness, a Christmas story told at lunch, a photo- and the feelings in life that matters. That's why maybe we feel so happy and relaxed when we watch the movie: We forget about the daily stress and want to be a part of Auggie Wren's world. new nothing of the chemistry of combustion, he did the best that he could, based upon what he knew.  Likewise, Smoke is a movie about people with limited knowledge and perspective.  Their assumptions are often wrong;  but, they do the best that they can.

Something to Talk About (1995)	character with any depth is Jamie (Brett Cullen)--very handsome, intelligent and caring--a real great performance.  A word of advice--this movie is VERY R rated.  There's tons of swearing (especially from Sedgwick) and VERY frank sexual dialogue--it is NOT for the kids (unless it's an edited for TV version).  It's an adult movie.Predictable but well-done.  Worth catching. failed when released because the exec's didn't know how to sell it to make money but none-the-less it is a classic in my book on relationships.  The choice of the title also didn't make sense because the song really has nothing to do with the movie.  Again, I think this was a marketing mistake and not the filmmakers. the heroine and wronged wife;Robert Duvall as the family patriarch; Gena Rowlands as thebeautiful and devoted spouse and mother; and Kyra Sedgwick asthe transgressive sister. Dennis Quaid as Grace's philanderinghusband is very appealing, so it's hard not to be rooting for he andGrace to reconcile. Finally, good cinematography and a portrait ofgracious Southern living make this film an enjoyable view. of the film: that Something to talk about' is the kind of film where you start out wondering how all these people are related, and end up knowing all to well'. I could not agree more, but I guess that is what you get when people start to gossip and talk!CMRS gives Something to talk about': 4 (Very Good Film) I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallström but it's a bearable one. 	5.7	0
Species (1995)	"one kept me entertained all the way through. Not the greatest movie ever made but not boring either. A fun B-movie type science fiction/horror movie, but with good actors.I'm giving it an 8, which to me means, ""liked it"", whereas a 6 to me would mean ""it was OK"". It was more than OK so I give it an 8. you don't think about it too much.Acting varies--Kingsley is TERRIBLE in his role. Michael Madsen is pretty good as part of the team as are Marg Helgenberger and (especially) Forest Whitaker. Herstridge is certainly beautiful but can't act--but the role doesn't call for acting.I'm giving it an 8. It's no classic but it moves quickly and I was never bored. or something... Who knows. Henstridge is great to look at and the above average cast give it their best shot with the lame dialogue and cliched scenes. Whitaker's empath character quickly irritates with his constant stating the bleedin' obvious, but I always get a kick out of watching Madsen, here in stereotypical tough guy mode. 'Species' is big dumb fun. of the cast is distinguished, with a very cool Michael Madsen stealing the show; the special effects are convincingly yucky; and the pacing is fast and unrelenting, with the ""search-and-destroy"" team being always only one step behind the pursued alien ""monster"". A forgettable film, but not nearly as bad as many reviews have suggested.      (**) even though they're cheap throughout - they do look fairly realistic. It's not until we get to the end and the director decides to spoil it with some abysmal CGI that the effects become a problem. But even so, Species takes its plot well and isn't too serious, and I've got to rate this as a really fun flick overall. "	5.8	0

I also to see the good guy, ""Cox,"" doing what he did late in the film, although it certainly adds life to the story.Nonetheless, it's definitely worth a look if you like a good drama and appreciate Duvall's talents. Cox and Aidean Quinn and Francis Fisher played Don Day and his wife. How could a picture like this miss? It played at only a few theaters and was quickly picked up by all the cable TV people. This film is far better than most of the movies being released today and I hope more people get to see it. this film. He is well supported by Aidan Quinn, Frances Fisher and Brian Dennehy, a cast which attracted my attention in the first place. I was interested, too, to discover that Clint Eastwood's daughter (Francesca Ruth Eastwood by Frances Fisher)played the role of Miss Fisher's daughter in the film. It's a shame the film did not have a wider distribution. it means you are one of those who have to have blood and guts,fast cars and hot chicks and action to enjoy yourself.And Iam not of that kind,thank god.All in all,this is the loveliest picture since ""Its a wonderful life"".Just pay attention and be patient and Iam sure you'll discover its true value.I give this film 10 out of 10! gut feelings, when everyone else treats him with humiliation or passes him off as a quack.

With a great cast and an amazing atmosphere throughout, this is one not to miss for fans of thrillers, film noir, sci-fi and especially the subgenre knwon as cyberbunk. 8 stars out of 10.In case you're interested in more underrated masterpieces, here's a list with some of my favorites:imdb.com/list/ls070242495 leads debate (internally, as well as verbally, a first for a Cameron movie) the implications and the possible consequences of such an action. Despite its flirtation with the mainstream, Strange Days is a film that dares to pervert the traditional course of Hollywood into a future that is worth seeing. Perhaps predictably, it made little impact at the box office. is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add.But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there. being ageless. The two most brilliant scenes are the opening sequence - the robbery in the Chinese restaurant - and the showdown down in the streets at the millenium party. Also the soundtrack (Deep Forest, Peter Gabriel, Skunk Anansia, Strange Fruit...) is one of the best I´ve ever heard, what makes ""Strange Days"" an unforgettable experience for every watcher.

Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The (Parapluies de Cherbourg, Les) (1964)	Both transport me to a world of colour, joy and heartache, yet both stay just the right side of sentimental too.Of course the plot is a little convoluted; of course the entirely sung script makes it a little jarring at first - but just sit back and let Les Parapluies do its magic. You won't regret it. I promise ;-) combine to transport you to a magical place.   I loved the fact that every word was sung, but it was not like opera at all.  After a few minutes it was as if every word is always sung and talking doesn't exist.  Catherine Deneuve was so beautiful!  I love this movie and highly recommend it. Only in France, and thank God for it. All the cast are brilliant - charming and charismatic; the production design looks like a psychedelic gingerbread house; the score is exceptional; the singing genuinely heart-felt and moving; and the whole thing is carried off with such effortless confidence and unreserved joy that it's impossible not to fall in love with it. good, the film moves quickly (90 minutes) and--quite simply--this is one of the best foreign films ever made. It's not for everybody but if you're a romantic (like me) you'll love it. But be warned--have PLENTY of tissue handy for the end. I've seen it four times and I STILL cry at the end! A definite must see. A 10+. if that's beautiful already, then what comes when the 20-year old Catherine Deneuve is in the lead role! Just WOW! Once again I don't bother explaining any of the plot, because there's no point really...but one of the saddest scenes in movie history, is the Esso-scene in this one. Watch it! if you're not too busy watching the latest Van-Damme. 	7.9	1
Tie That Binds, The (1995)	"give love to the traumatized girl. Meanwhile Leann and John begin a crime spree trying to find their daughter to take her back. ""The Tie that Binds"" is an effective low-budget thriller with a good story. The screenplay is well developed and builds tension, but unfortunately the conclusion is very poor. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Laços Diabólicos"" (""Diabolic Ties"")   I liked the way the movie made many connections of the theme like mother like daughter(also father) and the scenes when Julie used violence was quite surprising,  humorus, and actually thrilling.   The movie wasn't the greatest thriller,  yet the characters,  performances,  and scenes showed talent and I was satisfied with the rental. out than it should and ends with a particularly overdone, overextended climax. The performances are generally good and there are a few bits of imaginative camerawork, but the familiarity of the material proves to be overwhelming. The film has no personality, and most of the scenes seem to be just copies of similar events in other thrillers.   (*1/2) is!  In the final 20 minutes or so, the scriptwriters obviously suspended logical actions of the characters in favour of a more dramatic and visual finale. Too bad, because this would have been an otherwise excellent film.  Also, the inclusion of a real version of ""Mr. Flip Flop"" leading the little girl to the villain was unnecessarily cruel. ludicrous situation atop another? Stars Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine can't even scrape together the semblance of believability within this context, and both are at a loss (as the ""innocents"", Moira Kelly and Vincent Spano don't have it quite as bad, but their general lack of charisma puts them at a disadvantage regardless). Tiresome, unsubtle junk. NO STARS from **** "	5.0	0
Three Wishes (1995)	"Valley urban explosion! I thought the players were all fine and the child actors were very effective. The story dragged a bit but pacing is not everything - sometimes it is good to linger a bit and be nostalgic.  This is a good movie for thoughtful teens who can appreciate the message given about  home, hope and history. good movie for a family to watch together. I think many people can learn from this movie that we should cherish what we already have had in hand. As the saying says, happiness lies in satisfaction.And it's not a big story, so it may not have got much attention from audience. But still I would say it's a good movie. e-mailed one of my daughters and told her she too might enjoy it.. so what if it's fantasy...it was a feel good flick and I am happy I had the chance to view it..by far beats all the horror and murder movies and give hope that the world can be turned into a better place one man/woman at a time.... brilliant and makes this movie a solid 8/10. ""Be yourself"", Jack advises Tom. ""And be happy with what you have"" he adds much later in the movie. Hope and love will endure against all odds, if we allow magic into our lives. The same magic we believed in as kids. It is still there. You just have to admit it. I knew was that it was not R rated. To my great pleasure and surprise I found a gem of a movie I continually recommend to all my friends.After my brother and I watched it a few years ago you could have called us the ""blubber brothers"" as we both were overcome by the its generous wish for us all.

And that's what you sense through all of their scenes together, a meeting of minds more than a meeting of bodies.There were many who praised this movie, there were many who hated it, but love it or hate it, it holds a strange fascination which makes you remember it long after you've seen it. man or his life here, but what you will get is a story about love, madness, writing and the search for meaning.If you like what you see of Rimbaud from this movie, I would whole heartedly recommend his work to you and any and all written biographies as they will shed even more light on a truly great poet's life. acting also on behalf of the others in the cast, even when the script and the direction works against them. And it does, more than once. Maybe the plot got all confused, simply because the poetry of the poets was not taken into account.But a film gone awry can still be a wonderful experience. Frustrating, but wonderful. This one is. scat and sex and drug and rock'n'roll and get-down-and-get-dirty poets.Past that, it's the story of a great, if brief, flowering love ... the kind of love story you'd expect for people who live and breathe life in the way great alternaculture poets must.Eternity is where the sunlight mixes with the water.

To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995)	it's an admirable attempt. I think some of the reviewers on this site are a bit too harsh on this film. It is a fun bubble gum of a movie.

This movie was an education and a miserly score of 5.5 shows how unwidely entertained this membership is.See it. lives dangerously and tries to fit in, in her own special way. Swayze is the classy one, who is not allowed to forget her true nature. Wesley Snipes' role borders on caricature, but he keeps it from crossing the line between farcical and ridiculous. They all do very good work with this very risqué and difficult material. It works out. wish *I* looked that good.I suppose there was a kind of freedom in making this movie, for them, because they were not playing a character that looks like them in *real life*. I started out watching because if the novelty, ended up being invested in the characters and liking the movie.And Blythe Danner is always good, in anything she does. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo played believable drag queens, and they all did great jobs trying not to trip in their stiletto heels. Stockhard Channing was great too, as the abused wife who never gets to have any fun. The movie has a happy ending, and after the movie you find yourself accepting others for who they are. 	6.5	0

At least he handles a handgun like someone who has actually fired one. staff and provides a continuity from the first Under Siege movie.  This is all action showing Seagal as a dedicated and deadly force of protection for the train hostages and the citizens to the east.  The action moves, and some of the death blows are right out of the military manual. Watchable over and over and still exciting. I can and cannot watch.No one could possibly have a bad time watching this film (unless it's the UK version) and if you've had enough of Shane Meadows doing pretentious black and white stuff or Keira Knightely in a frock to last you a lifetime then the brainless and breathtaking action of Under Siege 2 is just what you need. Casey Ryback. No-one is more entertaining as to watch as the one man army than Segal. If you watch this film expecting an intellectual script and fine acting then you will be disappointed. But if you expect that from any all out action film I expect you are a fool. Totally over the top, totally unbelievable but a total blast. "	5.4	0
Unstrung Heroes (1995)	"family with lots of laughs early on but tears later. You could get an idea early on that it's kind of a sweet movie, but there are some uncomfortable scenes in here. There is a little bit of about everything, guaranteed to strike everyone's emotions somewhere along the way. The story stayed with me long after I first watched it. cast, all of them are really good! The last scene, when Steven is watching video tapes of his mother with his father is one of the most touching in the movie... This is one of those movies that celebrates the innocence of a child and a few adults who want to retain that innocence in a superficial and phony world. to his immediate family and his dying mother, newly confident and better equipped to cherish the remaining moments of her life.This is a special movie and I couldn't recommend it more highly. There's no sense of the maudlin where it might have gone that way, but there is great humor that will be enjoyable to a wide range of ages. family love to the screen.  While mom is very loving as well, she sadly and symbolically abandons Steven/Franz by dying and it is the weird (eccentric and harmlessly schizophrenic) uncles who support him thru it all, once again posing the question, ""Who really are the crazy (or heroes, for that matter) among us?""  I give it an 8. of the movie, he has had his bar mitzvah and feels freer in his existence.Some of the plot points may seem a little hackneyed, but Diane Keaton knows how to tell the story so that it isn't a cliché. A very good look at how the general atmosphere and zeitgeist in a certain part of American history affected one family. "	6.7	0
Unzipped (1995)	plus i really loved seeing a few of the really great style arbiters - Polly Mellen, Candy Pratts, Ingrid Sischy - on film. wish Andre Leon Talley had said more. and it was so fun to see mark morris and Sandra Bernhardt too! all in all a fabulous film for anyone in or interested in the creative and design fields. expect because Isaac is so engaging he almost convinces you that fashion can be interesting. It's a wild ride, and the only real problem is that there's too little Cindy Crawford (she doesn't turn up until about an hour or so into the film) and too much Naomi Campbell. But hey, that's what videos and fast-forward buttons were made for... with from Eartha Kitt to Miss Mellen are ridiculous! Don't see this movie only for the supermodels because while they are there, they aren't the main focus, if you want that set up go for Catwalk instead, but here lies the whimsical tale of a collection destined for greatness and a designer who is as entertaining as his is talented. that hair I would have had it cut a long time ago. Having said this, he is richer than I will ever be and he has loads of more prospects than I will ever have. So screw me and good for him. I guess I have to admit it, I really liked this film. It's a guilty pleasure. see it. The music adds much to the introspective yet whimsical tone of the film, and during the fashion show it really livens things up.  I wish there were a soundtrack available.  Put it this way, if you are interested in fashion or Mizrahi himself as a celebrity, you will like this, if neither is the case, you'll hate it. 	6.4	0

A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's.

If you watch this movie, have a big box of tissues, a big box of chocolates, and a large dose of the willing suspension of disbelief.

If you can't suspend your disbelief, skip it - you will just be irritated. those wonderful hollywood leading men of old, strong, silent, gorgeous, Cary Grant would have played this role back in the day, who would have thought to put Keanu in the same role?

Waterworld (1995)	"still far too serious for a movie like this. If he'd had the good sense to be a little more tongue-in-cheek, it would have helped a LOT. Still, it's not a bad movie by any means, and I really think all the negativity toward it is unnecessary. Enough with all the complaining... just sit back and enjoy it! 8/10 stars. imposed by the studio, so that corporate could get their investment back.

This was a tear down.Heaven's Gate wasn't awful - but just too slow. This movie isn't awful either, and neither is it slow. And if you're a motorhead - its extra fun.

It's a shame the ""experts"" (i.e. the critics who create nothing) trashed this one.

White Man's Burden (1995)	rather than a 90-minute film.  The point was to shake up the narrow-minded perspectives of two particularly bigoted groups of Americans, to kick them in the butt and make them consider that skin color isn't a factor in who you are.  Whatever else you want to say about the movie's performances or characterizations, it did its' job perfectly. whites, its a trip, just hearing that. I study psychology, and all these theories are pervasive, and they relate to science by the genetic concepts of the 20th century, i mean, eugenics and it is really wild. Anyway, this is a must see movie. You must see it. I'm mad I didn't know it existed for the last ten years. The picture displays atmospheric cinematography by Kurant and appropriate soundtrack by Howard Shore(Lord of Rings,The aviator),usual David Cronemberg's musician. The flick is well produced by Laurence Bender(Reservoir dogs,Pulp fiction). The motion picture is professionally directed by Desmond Nakano, a prestigious screenwriter. However failed in the Box-office and Nakano only directed another picture titled American pastime and again with no success. watch, we wonder how it will play out, and we're bothered by it. I analogize the film to Planet of the Apes in some ways because of its ability to make us step back and take a look at society in a different way entirely.  It is not as well done as Planet of the Apes but is worthwhile. nothing to do with colour it has to do with wealth.

If you want a classic Western flick and non-stop action, you may find it slow.  For anything more accurate you'll need to go the library; to date, this is the best film on Hickok. Ellen Barkin as Calamity Jane and David Arquette as Jack McCall. Jeff Bridges must be highlighted for special mention: his costumes and general manner look stunningly true to life when compared with real photos of that long dead gunfighter.As a piece of history, forget it. As rip-snorting entertainment, go see it, especially if you love the Western genre. Highly recommended. and pipes and the black and white flashbacks (with the camera canted just enough to suggest an off-kilter dream state) are great.

It talks about taking sides, the central character in each section tries not to take sides, but circumstances often prove such efforts futile. As with Kiril and Aleksander.In the film, all events happened before the rain, this sense of urgency, this beautiful sadness, and this inevitable tragedy. Before the Rain is my all time favourite movie. that makes this film work so powerfully. From the shattering opening section, to the startling second part, to the third story that brings it all together, this is a great film. It's been overlooked for some reason, mentioned rarely in film magazines and in best of the decade lists. But it's a phenomenal work, one that needs to be seen. circle completes.

When hate wins, innocence looses. watch this movie for a college class, and it instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time.  The story is exceptional, and the directorial brilliance of its creators brings the tragedy of an entire country to life.  It contrasts the folly of war and hatred with beautiful images of the people and places that they destroy. cinematography.Finally, I could never complaint about the directors excellent work. This was his debut if I'm not wrong and that was very promising, but I suppose this was his ""Citizen Kane"" and it'll probably be impossible to make anything similar.One rarely sees anything from Macedonia.But this is not only good forMacedonian cinema, it should have won the Oscar that year.

This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies...... conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that. television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making. movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance. this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances.

I can't rant and rave about anything artistically brilliant about ""Billy Madison.""  Yet it's one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's funny, it's original, it's Sandler!  Nuff said.My score:  8 (out of 10) an excellent idea of what you are in for.If you do not enjoy Billy's sunblock song, or the bit with the penguin, then you must turn off the movie and stop being such a nag about it.But for those of us who happen to enjoy movies that are silly and stupid, this is one of the best ones out there. his father's hotel ring.  His whole odyssey is utterly hilarious from start to finish.  Especially because he has cameos and stars like Norm MacDonald, Steve Buscemi, and Chris Farley as a Penguin lover (that penguin hadn't made me laugh that hard since the pee scene in Naked Gun).  Great fun (one of the best of 1995). A++ you in a good mood are Happy Gilmore, Beavis and Butthead Do America, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and Tommy Boy.Overall, Billy Madison has a somewhat stupid sense of humor, but it does make you laugh, and it's such an entertaining movie. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now and see what all the laughing is about. here is your movie.But that aside, ""Billy Madison"" isn't just awful like many other goofball comedies of the 90's and 00's, it is very entertaining and memorable... because it just manages to really make you laugh. And it's not dumb characters making stupid mistakes (like Black Sheep for example), just very weird characters making ""What the hell was that?!"" situations. "	6.4	0

Boys on the Side (1995)	Whoopi Goldberg played it in an understated way that shows her talent, that she can handle a lot more than the over-the-top comedic roles that she is so famous for. Matthew McConaughey plays a caricature, so there is really no indication of talent there. The ending swims in poignancy, without getting (too) cloying. This film is definitely worth a look. movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack, 'Boys on the side', is a movie that we can all learn from, to try and improve not only our friendships that we have, but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel, harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side': 4 (Very Good Film) is contrived, but the interaction between the characters is definitely not. Screenwriter Don Roos writes vivid dialogue and touching scenes, and the cast plays it to the hilt. Barrymore is at her best here, Goldberg is outstanding, and Parker--while not a varied actress--does solid work. Nice direction by Herbert Ross, who hasn't been this focused in years. ***1/2 from **** think her part as the lesbian was believeable, yet she did display both strength and humor to keep you interested.

Cure, The (1995)	Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). I don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity for watching The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 out of 10.

Thus Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really counts in life; and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life.This movie is tragic  but its message is sheer inspiration. how, despite Erik's streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure.I highly recommend 'The Cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting. was getting better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried hard in this movie which I don't usually do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! Now, I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone! later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

Castle Freak (1995)	"visual style of Gordon that has given us jewels such as the previously mentioned ""Re-Animator"", and the awesome ""Dagon"".While this is not as good as those 2 movies, it still stands as one of the best horror movies of the 90's, keeping that soul that 70's & 80's horror films used to have.Very recommended for fans of the genre. 8/10 Acting is also spot on, especially Jeffrey Combs in a straight man role (for once). While it would go to far to call this a lost genre classic, it deserves to be seen by more people than probably did. If you're a genre fan, give ""Castle Freak"" a chance. It might just win you over, like it did with me. one is particularly eerie. This certainly isn't one of Stuart Gordon's best, but there is no doubt that it outshines most other Horror productions from the mid 90s. As far as I am concerned, ""Castle Freak"" doesn't reach the brilliance of ""Re-Animator"", but it is definitely a creepy, highly atmospheric and original, above average example of good 90s Horror. Recommended! about this movie's acting you need your head checked....it's a Direct-to-Video film. It was definitely a surprise to me....and most likely it'll be a surprise to you....the horror fan.I give it around a 7 1/2.....like I said it wasn't great. But damn, the movie was unique, fun, sometimes creepy and overall a welcome edition to the land of HORROR! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! your plot, I think you'd appreciate this lost treasure (definitely one of the lesser-seen Gordon horror films). I wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been, because I was half in the bag from drinking Scoresby Scotch (it's the connoisseur's Scotch)... but it kept me feeling pretty good. Thanks, Full Moon Features, for one of your better offerings. "	5.9	0
Circle of Friends (1995)	"were so embracable in their portrayals as young adults in the 50's with all the sexual taboos. The scenery is grand!I watch this movie at least once a month and have recommended it to many friend who also enjoy it. (If you are into Irish countrysides you might want to watch ""The Matchmaker"" with David O'Hara - v. good also.) these. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again & never tire of it. The performances are fresh and sincere, and the script and direction are flawless. I recommend this movie if you want to see a slice of life that is simple and frank in how we relate to each other as human beings. Saffron Burrows is perfect as the vain and beautiful Nan. Geraldine O'Rawe plays Eve. Chris O'Donnell is Jack Foley, who makes a good impression. Alan Cumming, Colin Firth and Ciaran Hinds are perfect in their supporting roles.""Circle of Friends"", while not breaking any ground, is still a good movie to watch because Pat O'Connor's direction and the ensemble acting cast. indication as to what their thoughts and motivations were.  I was particulary disappointed to see that the special circumstances surrounding their initial meeting on the first day of university (the motorcycle accident) was completely rewritten in favour of a lack-lustre introduction.  But the biggest disappointment was taking a story about friendship and turning it into a romance movie. Benny was totally miscast. That the Benny of the book is a big woman is relevant to the storyline, whereas Minnie Driver, although quite tall, can't be called big under any stretch of the imagination. The film characters seemed wooden to me in comparison with the book characters. However, if you're not into reading books, the film is worth watching. "	6.6	0

Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then you'll enjoy ""Clerks"". His brand of humour isn't for everyone. This is his first film and it's flawed, to be sure. But in my humble opinion, it's still Smith's best. of a ruling class. Especially since I rule."") or very politically incorrect antics (the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby).If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status. It has priceless dialogue, wisecracking characters and loads of swearing. What else can you ask for? and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper). In short I absolutely love this film and it gets better and better with every viewing. Rent this film as soon as possible if you haven't already. your seat. ""Clerks."" also contains many Smith trademarks including ""Star Wars"" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called ""New Jersey Trilogy.""

If you aren't a clerk, and you watch this movie, remember this: This movie is as true to form as it gets. Some people claim it to be one of the best comedies of the past decade.

Don Juan DeMarco (1995)	"thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts.Love is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful. for retirement and the best times of their lives.Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of all time. His performance is true and expressive and I just love his smile. I compare this performance to that of his character of Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". I have no problem, whatsoever, recommending this movie to everyone. and think about it.Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story.  Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6. I give it a 9 out of 10!! and a girl, this would be it.Looking at Johnny Depp might also help her in that regard.Its also a great fun family movie - which is a delicate balance to strike.4/5Disclaimer: there are about two sex scenes, which, though very discreetly and beautifully shot, featuring no vital organs, may be inappropriate for littlies, if you wish to shield them thus. in the mental hospital, while Jack gets his grove back :-) Coming back to the technical aspects of the film, I don't think there's anything lacking there.

American Legal System and sexual harrassment, and proves that sexual harrassment works on two levels.  Sex is truly power, and if you have it, you have it, and if you don't...well, you'll have to work hard to prove yourself.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but read the novel in addition to the movie. You won't regret it. rather big. Instead, sex is portrayed as the key power in the situation. Catherine Alvarez states in the film ""Sexual harassment is not about sex, it's about power. She has it, you don't"". Pretty catchy way to portray sexual harassment. Technology is later brought in as a power to...but why should I say anything more? See the film for yourself. neatly, but all in all, this is pretty good entertainment from start to finish.  The movie touches an important issues, sexual harassment in the workplace, and makes it more interesting by making the woman the aggressor and the man the victim.  Not surprisingly, I noticed that women gave this movie a higher average rating than did the men. shout out to Caroline Goodall who wisely underplays it as the wife. While the interior set design (Gary Lewis/Joseph Hodges) for the DigiCom HQ is wonderful with its 90s excess of glass meeting mirrors and open spaces.

I was saddened by the way they handled the showdown - there was MUCH more into this.As a fan of movies in that time period, I can still give em a 5/10 on it, because they tried. But times have changed. I would only watch it on free TV if you are an fan of Patsy or Denise. A cop, who was guarding Sarah at her ballet class, is murdered by Reynolds.

In addition , ¨Drop zone¨ film in which the action lovers will enjoy this ode to the skydiving sport, in spite of story deficiencies . Rating : Good , worthwhile watching . from the mediocre to the above average. And Yancy Butler is absolutely smoking. End of story.This movie is actually one of the more compulsively watchable to be released at the end of the action movie renaissance of the mid-'80s to mid-'90s. I'd watch it right now, even though I just saw it last night. My definition of a good movie. Gary Busey is also in the movie,and is his usual reliable self.Michael Jeter is also good for some laughs.and of course,for eye candy,we have Yancy Butler,who is also a fairly good actress.at least i have always thought so.when you put everything together,the movie is pretty good though not great.still, i enjoyed it for the most part.my vote for ""Drop Zone"":7/10 sequences in this movie.plot wise, the movie kinda plods along, not a whole lot of suspense but enough of a story to keep people entertained. I think its worth watching at least once, purely for the skydiving and action sequences.Also, besides being a fairly competent actress - one I can actually believe skydives -  Yancy Butler is really hot. is a thoroughly enjoyable action romp.  The action is excellent, the girls are gorgeous, and the musical score is top notch.  If you go in looking for a touching movie, don't bother.  But if you just want something to enjoy for a couple hours of visual fun that requires little mental exercise, this will do quite nicely. "	5.6	0
Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995)	"TURNS ON THE RADIO does offer, however, is a magical, mystical feel in a city where lady luck is prayed upon every second, and characters who obviously take themselves too seriously only to learn that success and fortune can fade in the flash of a lightning bolt. Other interesting and great casting mentions go to Bobcat Goldthwait and David Cross. this little diamond in the rough? The chemistry between Dylan McDermott and Nancy Travis sizzles and James LeGros makes a charming quirky sidekick. I could have lived without the Bobcat Goldthwait cameo, but when isn't that the case?Here's a good acid test: if you liked Toys, L.A. Story or the Linguini Incident then you'll like Destiny Turns on the Radio. and Allen Garfield as Vinny Vedivici, the slob producer who can make her dreams come true.It may not hit all its marks, but ""Destiny Turns on the Radio"" convinces you it doesn't have to. It is one of those irresistible movies that you don't know why you enjoy it, but can't help doing so nonetheless. Don't be shy, accept ""Destiny"". This film, with its bow to magic realism, is both amusing and surprising. Tarantino is not effective as an actor, I feel.  Apparently he is too self-conscious or, perhaps, does not rehearse.  Aside from his performance (and it is not actually bad), the performances are fine.  Just about every actor in the film does a good job. i'm no fan of Las Vegas, where the movie is set, but the little motel with its homage to film stars of the 1950's hearkens ones memory back to a time when the Strip was much less commercialized and overdone, a time when life seemed simpler, more magical, and just plain fun .. check out this little gem for yourself "	4.5	0

This ensures no distraction, and makes sure that we are put firmly within our character's plight.On the whole, this is one of the best films that Polanski ever made. Considering his prowess as a filmmaker; that is really saying something and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies. of their characters. All three roles were depicted as intensely real. I enjoyed this thriller from the moment it began to the very end. You are immediately engaged in her reality, rather than experiencing a slow build up seen with most movies. Very satisfying because no character was one-sided, but they were multi-dimensional, with each having a unique history. Bravo! a strong resemblance with the brutal tortures during Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. It is not filmed in that country, but they use Chilean money, they eat Chilean bread and they mention Tavelli, a popular café in Santiago. Beautiful music. Schubert's Death and the Maiden, is played throughout the movie.A great film to view with people who enjoy having discussions after.Enjoy! unnatural that they are unable to see their extent. They cannot think clearly and so their thinking structure changes and they begin to take completely absurd things into consideration. Every person reacts a little differently to the situation. I love this, and that's why I give this movie the best rating. I couldn't find any flaws in the movie, actually. The film is an X ray into secret, open wounds. We're never sure what happens in Sigourney's mind, but we're aware that her pain and her anger are real. We are unable to take sides, we're too afraid. We want for the ordeal to end and yet, we're glued to the discomfort and uncertainty. Recommended for masochists and film lovers. 	7.3	0
Dolores Claiborne (1995)	"critics missed how good it was. I notice Maltin's book now raves over the film, giving it 3 1/2 stars, the same rating he gives to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. The violence here is more psychological than bloody, but DOLORES is every bit as good a thriller as LAMBS, and Bates, quite frankly, can act circles around Jodie Foster. David Strathairn's Joe St. George surely deserves a high place in the canon of Stephen King movie villains. Strathairn makes him as bad as can be, and yet there's occasionally a playful touch that *almost* makes us see why Dolores married him in the first place.In the end, a rather underrated film, successful on many levels. 8.5. out of 10. mannerisms fit perfectly to build her terribly tormented character.That's what good story-telling is all about: even if you already know the plot from A to Z, you just want to see once again the way it unfolds, like a good scary fairy tale. ""Dolores Claiborne"" is not without faults, but it's certainly worth your time, and even more than once. a victim than even she knows. Christopher Plummer is excellent as the detective.Taylor Hackford's direction is absolutely brilliant - as is the use of color saturation and creative scene blending and transition to move seamlessly between present and past.This is an outstanding film - well worth the Oscar nominations it received (as well as those it did not!). HIghest rating! are Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kathy Bates. They did an amazing job of portraying a estranged mother and daughter too haunted by past events to once again come together. The movie is a must see for everyone and it helps greatly to read the book before seeing the movie. I believe this movie should have received more than one award. "	7.4	0

Eat Drink Man Woman (Yin shi nan nu) (1994)	the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life.  And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it. By the end, you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 10/10. executive, but only because time-honoured attitudes debarred her, as a woman, from following in her father's footsteps as a cook.Unlike the classic Hollywood film, there is little out-and-out conflict in this movie, which seems to be based more on the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang, mutually dependent opposites. But whatever its underlying cinematic rationale, it is a masterpiece. effortlessly with a superior sense of rhythm; it's always pleasing, even when the content feels overly familiar.  He demonstrates a healthy respect for his characters (with the exception of a divorcee whose bitter views of marriage don't stop her from pursuing Lung)--everyone gets to play out their lives with dignity and happiness and without an ounce of filmmaker moralizing. However, the old values still need to be cherished and passed on to the next generation since they are the foundations which give sense and meaning to a life which tends to assimilate happiness to disposable items and economic success. In doing so, Chu and her daughters get reconciled, as well as their traditional background comes to terms with modernity. is the obnoxious older lady that has set her sights on Dad! How the many relationships are resolved is masterful and provided me with a good laugh!

Character development, secrets, and inner truths are revealed slowly and carefully and in non-linear fashion by Egoyan's delicate director's hand.  The ""exotic"" flavored yet haunting musical score is an added bonus.  Worth a look if you are in the right mood and know what to expect from Egoyan. go. Some of the dialogue seems poetic, cynical and truthful all at the same time. A film that you really need to watch to the end before you really feel you understand it's puzzle (and even then there seems to be something just out of grasp this viewing). A moving portrait of life that will linger in your mind afterwards. (difficult as that may be at times) in the scenes shot in the club. The really interesting stuff occurs at the margins of the film, as the gulf separating the storylines begin to vanish, and the final scene gives you the keystone to a horrifying clear vision of a sadness so overwhelming that no one in the film escapes unscathed. paying for it. Finally, the frequent appearance of parrots and their uncharacteristic silence reflects the characters' inability to communicate and overcome the losses of their past.  I've really grown to admire this film and Egoyan's work in general.  In 'Exotica' he creates a work of complex symmetry and interconnecting symbols while also conveying an atmosphere of lyrical intensity.  It's also about the danger in leaping to conclusions -  the viewer is often tempted to make a judgement about what he or she sees, and that judgement is often both wrong and unfair.  If this all sounds like homework, be assured that the movie is also a lot of fun: it's sexy and interesting and inspired. "	7.1	0
Exit to Eden (1994)	film.  I thought the contrast of the interplay between Mercurio and Delaney and between Ackroyd, O'Donnell and the crooks was expertly handled.

It may not be Olivier doing Hamlet, but it beats Shatner playing Othello.  Recommended for Dana Delaney and Rosie fans with the obligatory Hector Elizando appearance though he's done much better elsewhere. and Sheila Kingston also travel to Eden pursuing supercriminals Nina and Omar, who are also on Eden to kill Elliot and retrieve the pictures he has taken of them.  This is a well made movie with some laughs, sex, and bubbly romance.Exit to Eden is Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, mild language, brief gore, and some violence. screen that had been in my head reading the book.  I guess if it had been passed off as other than a comedy, it would have to be labeled pornography.  The good parts of the movie show that this could have been a great project if they had attempted to stay close to the spirit of the novel. cast is good except the above duo. Dana Delany is great as the Mistress of a pleasure island; she takes a chance and shows her sexy side of herself as well as full body nudity.

More Ed Woods , please! about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there; and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With ""Ed Wood"", I'm not always interested in following the story, but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there. his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough (or not) ""Ed Wood"" died at the box office but as it happens more often than not, ""Ed Wood"" is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time. Yes, that business of time never fails. Greatness prevails. much the movie's legitimacy would have been lessened if it was in color. I must assure you that, no matter how offbeat and strange it looks, this film is an absolute classic that begs to be seen. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has a wicked sense of humor and is sure to have you in stitches. pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this  that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.

And then of course Meg Ryan is always the perfect pick for these kinds of films. What can I say other than opposites really do attract in this fun-loving completely romantic movie. This is definitely a classic movie in my mind and a must buy, not rent. in my opinion. His entire persona here makes it difficult to believe that Kline isn't really French. He must have had a fantastic language coach! Also, there is great on screen chemistry between Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline.It's a delightful, light hearted film, a good date movie, and not necessarily just a chick flick as my husband enjoyed it too. 	6.6	0

It would be a bit too frightening for small children.Even though I knew I was being strongly manipulated by the inevitable happy ending, I could not help myself from bursting into tears.  I don't think I've seen this kid do one false thing in front of a camera.  He plays or embodies youthful promise and that  in-between adolescence and adulthood stage like no other actor I've seen.  The same expressiveness is in ""King of the Hill"" -- astonishing really.  Oh yeah, and the dog is great too! as the resourceful Angus. Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers are seen as the parents.

Hideaway (1995)	"of the shining factors in this movie.  What with his penetrating stare and spooky, well-spoken accent he made, to me, the perfect killer.  A round of applause for the young man, if you please.Personally, I see Hideaway as a movie that should be a big hit with the gothic community, and I shall stand by my word regardless... Otherwise, this is an entertaining horror thriller, with trippy ""tunnel vision"" (literally) sequences, flashes of dark humor and the usual good performance by Jeff Goldblum. The ""good vs. evil"" climax does come off a bit cheesy, but that doesn't happen because the effects are not good; it happens because of the way in which they are employed.

I mean they dont even get the characters right...Regina (Silverstone) is supposed to be a nine year old ""crippled"" (as she defines herself in the book). Changing her character takes away from the plot of the story! It's a shame that they waste Koontz's amazing talent on movie's like these. earlier Brett Leonard's horror film ""The Dead Pit""(1989-check out my comment of it!)and this director is incredibly overlooked and talented.""Hideawy"" is excellent-fast-paced,violent and really dark.The visuals(especially the vision of Hell)are really impressive,and Jeremy Sisto as a satanic killer Vassago is outstanding-he is pure evil!Great soundtrack bu such industrial/metal bands like KMFDM,Fear Factory,Godflesh(""Nihil""-I love this song!)and Front Line Assembly.My absolute recommendation. some scenes that I preferred to watch through half-closed fingers, but for the most part, it was truly a wonderful film.

Only the acting from the humans and a few of the sometimes out-of-place scenes hurt the movie just a tad, but not enough to stop me from giving this underrated movie the recommendation it truly deserves. do not weep watching a movie, but this dog Fluke made me shed tears from beginning to the (somewhat bitter) end. The story is completely unbelievable, so what!, but very funny all the way. Can't understand what those people's hearts are made of that do not like a story like this. I'd rather watch Fluke ten times than Rambo once! life, so much the better. This is a movie for people of all ages. The animal wranglers did an outstanding job, ditto the actors. Have not seen the dog who played Fluke before; wonder if he is still in the acting business.Would be glad to see more films of similar ilk, but I have not run across many like this. being left alone, and move on.... The scene by the Gravestone, when she realises just who Fluke is, as he scrapes away the snow to reveal his name, is one of the most moving pieces of film I've ever seen!! But at the VERY end, something nice happens...he meets his old friend again!!!! This film is just SOOOOOOO BRILLIANT!!!!Gary Edwards saddest movies I've seen, just because of when the dogs are in trouble, and also when they're lonely or hurt.  I really like how the story is about a dog who is transformed into a human to find his family; it was pretty cool.  I would reccommend a big box of tissues for this movie-just to be prepared. 	6.7	0
Farinelli: il castrato (1994)	"rather, the people with the money to afford the (by our standards) enormous ticket prices had simply lost interest.One commentator here is skeptical about many ""period"" details. And rightly: for starters, that's not the way boys were castrated, but you don't need to know the truth. Relax, just enjoy the music and the costumes and the actors chewing the scenery. known as disinterested in sex, thus I have no idea why the sex scenes in the film were included. True, there WERE castrati who did engage in pleasures of the flesh, but Farinelli was NOT one of them, or at least there are no historical records suggesting so.All that aside, this movie was a lavishly done production and a must-see! a lot of other aspects to explore. We also get to see the obligatory scenes of audiences being mesmerized by opera, as if they were some island natives and not opera house regulars. Nevertheless, being a high budget movie, it has great costumes and beautiful scenery. Most of all you get the chance to explore the divine music of Haendel. and a sadness that is truly stunningly and sensitively achieved whilst adding to the story line. I love this film and cannot possibly recommend it enough. Any lover of Early Music should revel in it, but it has been lifted out of the ordinary and into the universal and sublime by that one small realization. Superlatives cannot do it justice. well-researched and meticulously designed. The combination real-and-computer-created vocal work is fascinating in its etherial timbre and in its negotiation of Handelean melismas, embellishments and assorted ornamentation. Likewise, the baroque pit orchestra and period opera house decor is strikingly detailed.What a pity ""Farinelli"" fails in its main opportunity: to convey a simple, heart-felt story of one of history's most celebrated singers.

Gordy (1995)	"a feel good movie with a happy ending. If you need profanity, nudity, sex,violence or rude and disrespectful kids in a movie in order to like it then skip Gordy. It has none of that. The only dirt in this movie is actual dirt on the pigs. Gordy is a good movie for those who like clean, lighthearted family entertainment. Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale (It was so unspeakably awful, I couldn't last 3 minutes after it. It's a hobo's version of Gordy) or one of South Park's top 10 worst episodes where they ripped off the whole plot by making 4 retarded idiots with annoying voices saving baby cows from a slaugther house (That too, is a hobo's Gordy). about it. My kids don't really like Babe, I assume, because it goes at a slower pace and is not so flashy, but I'm sure that once they are older, they will enjoy it much more than Gordy. Gordy just has no substance. If you are looking for something that you can enjoy with your children, this is not it! which country music singer Doug Stone plays her father. Later they make friends with a wealthy family which Gordy saves a wealthy son from the pool.That's a fun movie to watch.Plus country music singers like Christy Lane, Moe Brandy, Roy Clark, and Tom Lester of ""Green Acres"" fame appears in this movie as well.I give it 10 out of 10. the animals never looked like they were talking, the plot was completely uninvolving, and the acting was mediocre at best. One nice thing was finding out the reason that Tom Lester (Eb from ""Green Acres"") never got anywhere with his career. He's a one-note performer. At least Eb had some decent writers. Now my daughter is happily watching ""The Aristocats"". "	3.9	0
Gumby: The Movie (1995)	"now even at seven. I would highly recommend it to anyone with small children. I was a teen, I came up with what I thought could only be the best idea in the world.  A ""Terminator II"" parody with the cast of ""Gumby"" gone bad. Art Clokey and I must be psychic friends or something because here we are with the Gumby movie, and it's Evil Robot Gumby.Yes.  Oh yes.This movie rules. most of them are alright. I don't know, maybe I have now seen it too many times. However, since I liked the film more during previous viewings, and enjoyed a bit of it this time, I have to give it credit, and do recommend it for stop-motion fans of all ages. You just might not want to expect a masterpiece. utterly psychedelic claymation of the last few minutes of the film, because it really is beautifully done. If you expect Aardman Animation or something modern, you should adjust my rating down a few points -- this probably isn't for you. But if you remember Gumby and would like just another short while with him and his friends, here's your chance. of said face, and the fact that said teardrop is a professor of some kind. I can even accept the fact that everyone in the world looks normal, except for Gumby and his pals, who are highly stylized blocks of primary colors.

The film also highlights the conflict within the african american/black community towards police and police brutality and how it is hard for even them to sometimes accept black police officers.

Hoop Dreams (1994)	shows you exactly how real life differs from the garbage that passes for representation of youth on TV and in film today.I really can't say enough about the need for more films like this, the fact that the Academy Awards were changed because of the strength of this film goes some way to showing you exactly how powerful it is. no license, we'd have 350-hour documentaries.At one moment near the end, William's coach says goodbye to him and as he walks out his coach mentions that that's the system: one goes out, another comes in. It feels like we're saying bye to a member of the family. This is a life-affirming experience, a family that should be visited again. 10/10 parties when it comes to the well being of inner city kids, who just happen to be good basketball players. Considering the state of pro basketball now, this kind of shows how the downward cycle of basketball was seeking lower standards. Sometimes funny, often times sad and poignant, this film is easily one of the best documentaries of all time. By examining not only the players but also their families and environments, we are given a clearer view of their aspirations and motivations, what they plan to achieve and what they wish to avoid.    I will not summarize or elaborate further.  If you have not seen this movie, put it on the short list.  9/10. have wept at your hardships, and screamed joyously at your triumphs.

Heavenly Creatures (1994)	"the Feebles"") are mainstream accessible--in ways that Lynch, especially, could barely consider (although ""The Frighteners"" was painfully overlooked by the US market)--makes me wish that he'd try his hand at more mainstream material.Imagine what a Peter Jackson ""Titanic"" would have been like...and compare that to what a James Cameron ""Heavenly Creatures"" would have been like and you get my point. it.The direction is great and it delivers a complex story in a colourful and fanciful manner, but the main praise should go to the two lead actresses who deal with really difficult characters and do so in a confident and believable manner  even if the material means that many of us will want to find what they did abhorrent. classic thriller with cheap tricks, Peter Jackson gets you inside the twisted minds of these two girls, and whether you hate them in the end or not, you completely understand why these girls did what they did...and that it was doomed from the start. Kate Winslet is just brilliant. WHY wasn't she given every award under the sun for this?!?!??! By the end of the film, they do the unthinkable.Kate Winslet is superb as Juliet. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Peter Jackson does a masterful job of capturing the essence of 1950s religious repression in New Zealand. It could be England or American in the 1950s. Heavenly Creatures will appeal to anyone who enjoys psychological twists and turns. play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction , as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful , haunting , thoughtful and incisive .

But the film was ignored.Above all, however, Gary Oldman's performance ranked among the best in the world - but it, too, was ignored.Give the film another chance.  It deserves FAR more than it GOT. It was, simply, beautiful... blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament. It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.  And it's but one of the more astounding moments from an astounding motion picture that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10. the truth is (even though NO ONE KNOWS in this case) that they are blinded to the rest. The director is a Beethoven fanatic, and I found this movie to be a loving portrayal. Gary Oldman was absolutely fantastic! He learned to play the piano (spent months doing it) in order to be authentic. Thumbs WAY up on this one. moment when Beethoven first plays the 'Moonlight Sonata', and the breathtaking 'Ode to Joy' sequence, framed against an unhappy memory from Beethoven's youth, which culminates in a moment of supreme cinematic glory, one of the most beautiful images this reviewer has ever seen. Vivid production design by Jirí Hlupý, expansive scope photography by Peter Suschitzky; filmed on location in Prague. and will remain with me forever. The movie is incredible and the Academy awards should collectively hang their heads in shame for being so dull not to see this movie as worthy of even being nominated due to its silly rules, or for never recognising Oldman then or since for the wonderful and great English actor that he truly is. 	7.5	1
Hunted, The (1995)	"almost an entirely Chinese cast). If you're in the mood for an fun, entertaining, semi-intelligent B-action flick, I whole-heartedly recommend this one. Oddly enough, the writer of ""Pretty Woman"" wrote and directed this flick, which may explain why my wife liked it, too. Of course, the same guy did a flick called ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"". experience which shocked a lot of us and the crowd I was with, were prepared for brutal action. The Hunted works as a Ninja actioner and is generally better polished than almost anything made in the 80's. It's slick, brutal and overall a fast paced actioner which in the end, is all we ask for.* * * out of 4-(Good) middle of a war. The sword-fight choreography is decent and very realistic. The Japanese actors put on a splendid show. This a gripping, colorful and highly satisfying film that will never have you bored at any point. I find it quite under-rated because it is quite well developed despite its obscurity. This is something I would recommend to any viewer. ""How far can a code of honor go?"". What struck me in this movie is the excellent use of the Japanese scenery i.c. Tokyo, the bullit-trains, the temples, the ninja way of life...The score is by the heart beat drummers Kodo. A great action packed movie with a lot of tension in a very beautiful package! Don't lose your head! as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts.

I.Q. (1994)	"between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. How they stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart.

My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance, if you yourself can't participate in one. It's a good 'un! as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.I highly recommend this movie.  It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here.  Watch it and enjoy! Kurt and Boris letting all the research animals free!Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: ""Don't let your brain interfere with your heart"". Ed Walters: ""When was the last time he said ""Wahoo""""? Catherine Boyd: ""Well I'm sure I don't know"". This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape and every once and awhile I will watch it again. The supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry (""agae"", ""a total pygmy package""!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as ""Greek chorus"" - ""but time doesn't exist""), Durning (""something we can launch from NJ""), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins' boss and co-worker at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies have Eisenhower??).Don't miss this overlooked treasure.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)	"all of these deep, important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters, haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue. Gripping from start to finish, you will be enamoured at the vampire-world opened up to you; and by the end, you are left wondering what choice you would have made, given the one that Lestat never had... them that is close, is the kill. Killing is highly ""erotic"" to vampires. However, this too is really asexual, and so again, gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this, which apparently came across as homo-eroticism, were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different, how non-human, that vampires are. refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix - originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title - who died of a drugs overdose during pre-production; his role was taken by Christian Slater. Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002). the book, I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel, here's a clue that might prove useful in the future: the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Don't waste your time complaining about something that is understood. flair for dark style (in most of his other films too), and more importantly produces a epic tale with sturdy direction.

If these superfluous scenes had been cut, perhaps there would have been time to go deeper into Jefferson's politics, which after all is why the man is remembered today. the revolution.  The movie even seems soft on the ancienne regime, which over time killed a lot more people than the Terror.These muted investigations of freedom in the film move very slowly, but still hold interest--they are thoughtful, probing, and, to a degree, don't pass simplistic judgements on people.  Cerebral film, but then Jefferson was a cerebral guy! being. Paltrow is very persuasive as Patsy, and many of the rest of the cast present excellent (or well-proportioned) characterizations. Except for some trivial inaccuracies, this is a richly textured reconstruction of history as it may very well have occurred. I find that I look in on it just about every time it pops up on cable--and I'm always rewarded. the film are well enough executed, while the creators, Prawer Jhabvala and Ivory, do provide us with a little seasoned food for the intellect, both here and elsewhere.""Jefferson in Paris"" does contain a few speech anachronisms but otherwise seems to have found the flavour of the period. Altogether, not an exceptional film, but one which has much to recommend it. "	5.7	0
Junior (1994)	"ultimate ""female"" experience. The contrast keeps the comedy rolling, while the characters carry the film.It is hardly a profound film, although it is intelligently written. The issues raised rely on simple male vs. female differences and the contrast of Schwarzenegger's image with this role is used to full effect. It's an enjoyable film with strong performances by Thompson and DeVito. underused--she doesn't get any good funny scenes till the end.  Also, where else will you see Arnie in a dress?It's a one joke film.  Is it a good film?  No.  Do I like it?  Very much. Call it a guilty favorite.One complaint--at 2 hours it's too long.  Couldn't it have been trimmed a little? the boo-boos are meant that way... Anyway, if you don't mind the occasional sexist cliche, and if you want to see Mister (Hollywood) Universe in the charming role of a peaceable pregnant researcher, this movie packs two hours of hearty laughter. In the whole movie, Arnold sends flying only one man, once - the only bad guy in the movie. and downs of being pregnant, but no matter how outlandish the premise is, there is no denying that the movie is definitely pretty charming. It was great to see Schwarzeneggger and Danny DeVito together again after their classic work together in Twins several years earlier. Once again, they have come together and brought us a great piece of family entertainment.  typical maternal figure under large doses of hormones and an experimental medication provides lots of opportunity for comedy and some real poignant vignettes. Frank Langella's character as dean of the university sponsoring the research is a bit over-done and becomes annoying. Emma Thompson plays lonely research scientist attracted to Arnold who becomes much more involved than she originally intended. "	4.6	0

Compared to another movie psycho, the deliciously evil Hannibal Lecter, Harris' Sullivan is simply annoying.""Just Cause"" doesn't offer anything radically new in this movie genre, but it is a solid, mostly well-acted film who should deliver enough thrills and excitement to satisfy most viewers.

He comes to realize that he is more than what people may think of him. He gains courage and self respect. Now, even if that is done in a pop culture/bubble gum sort of way, it should be respected.Plus Kate Winslet looks just as hot now as she did ten years ago. not only for kids, but for adults, too. The point isn't the historical drama, although that's a lot of fun even if it's more like a medieval section of Disney World than 6th Century England. The point, at least in this particular instantiation of A Connecticut Yankee, is the removal of conceptual/environmental ruts that get in the way of self-actualization. for this live action Disney fantasy, but one that doesn't suggest that it's generally considered abysmal, I'm sure many kids would enjoy it, and maybe their parents as well. However, if you don't fall into either of those categories, I suggest you skip this movie and watch a more widely appealing fantasy film (if you're into that kind of thing). Very cute. Warm. "	4.8	0
Kiss of Death (1995)	"thought NYPD Blue was very overrated, except for Dennis Franz. However, I think that David Caruso is a much better movie actor than he gets credit for. This one is definitely worth seeing. It is not a stupid high-action movie like Armageddon. However, it does have some very intense and well staged scenes that will keep action movie fans happy. hammy.  His character is full of ticks and eccentricities that at the end of the day that's all Cage has to do.Overall this is a solid thriller with no surprises.  Caruso fans (like me) will like it regardless because it's Caruso doing his usual role.  But others may not be so easily made to overlook the weaknesses. That is the strongest look I had seen since Stallone did ""First Blood, Part II"". Cage is a physical bull and it's impressive. I wouldn't have recognized him if I hadn't seen the trailer with his name on it beforehand. If you never saw this, see it. For no other reason than to be scared of Nic Cage. I was. didnt get much press when released (probably due to Caruso's controversial exit from NYPD Blue) this film builds the suspense and keeps you involved and interested.Caruso, the Cagney for the 90s, plays his part great with a tension you can feel. All the other roles are played well in this sleeper movie.. Well recommended Kiss of Death rates a 8 Nicholas Cage is often accused of playing over the top, but in the case of Little Junior, over the top is the way to go.There are also good performances by Stanley Tucci and Samuel L. Jackson. Tucci excels in portraying charming snakes. When he leers and sneers, it is impossible to keep from watching him.This movie was really very enjoyable. "	5.9	0
Little Women (1994)	"more than it could have been.It's a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in it's portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to it's own story and portrayal of people and their lives. It's beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film. as Laurie was everything the ""boy next door"" should be: handsome, kind, and charming. His chemistry with Winona Ryder was considerable, and made their friendship very believable. Susan Sarandon played a wonderful Marmee, supportive and loving towards her girls.Another thing I would recommend is the soundtrack to this movie, composed by Thomas Newman, which has some gorgeous music on it.10/10 be very bittersweet, but it is a joyful film, and says a lot about people and our emotions and our lives and yet is not confrontational in the least. It pulled out themes and messages which are often looked over out of one of the world's most famous books and made a lasting work of art that touches your heart. usual)I usually don't like remakes of any movie, but this one was wonderful!!!

No other film makes me tear up or cry as much for its brutal honesty, it's uncliched tenderness, and heartfelt truth about those ultimately human truths- love, kindness, and the magic of believing.  Rarely does a film so positively move one's heart.  Seek this film out.  Go now. is worth watching.Side note-little boys might not find the film engaging. It is kind of chick-flick for the tween set. That doesn't mean it's totally male-unfriendly. Fathers of daughters will be hard-pressed to avoid shedding a tear or two.If you have a tween daughter, save some rental money and just buy it! She's going to watch it over and over. Sarah is imaginative and smart. Livinia doesn't like Sarah because she is a threat to her popularity.

I recommend both the book and the movie. she literally burns down their outdoor shower from her body heat and then runs naked across the plain only to be scooped up and carried away on horseback by a bandit is one of the sexiest moments ever put on film.This movie is not for everyone, but if you enjoy erotic (but NOT pornographic) fantasy, try ""Like Water for Chocolate""!

This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power never fail to move me. very good scenes. - The movie is a kick in the nuts to ""civilized life"" and state affairs. - The anarchistic attitude. - The character Tristan Ludlow. - The character William Ludlow. - The emotional ride.Reasons to NOT see the movie: - You will be called a pathetic romantic if you like it. And you will most probably like it... In this movie he was rustic, yet thoughtful.  He was strong and vulnerable.  He had a great love for family(especially his father) and for a woman he knew should not be his. This film a true epic with history, talent, superior cinematography,  and most of all(and what many movies of today lack)..  closure. Watch and wonder It is rare when watching a movie, you cannot pick the ending. The ending to this movie was so amazing, and the fact that it wasn't obvious what was going to happen made this movie more enjoyable.James Horner is a master. Just like he did with Titanic, the score for Legends of the Fall took the movie to another level. you've watched the film to its fullest and there's no more stories left untold, that's what I look for in a good film. Even though the story was tragic, it was a story of love, loyalty and family. I give it a 9/10...if you haven't seen this movie yet...SEE IT! You'll love it, even if you don't fancy Brad Pitt.

Major Payne (1995)	"although I was in the R.A.F cadets at school, and have a brother in the British army (a Major, no less!!!) I have not been through the 'boot camp experience', yet still found the movie to be very funny.  Bottom line though, I can see it's not for everyone, so use your discretion.8/10 for me ? /10 for you voice.  Wayans delivers his dialogue in a manner almost reminiscent TV's The Nanny - nasal and grating.  However, he performs with such dry sarcasm and a fantastic permanent grimace that he is a real stand-out, and ultimately the film probably wouldn't work as well with another actor in the role. For light entertainment value, 7/10 for Major Payne. team scene at the end brought back fond memories (yup, we really did cool drills like that)...Damon Wayans is just...damn, he's funny. The one-liners he delivers, and the way he delivers them, is too much. I'd love to see the blooper reel. If the movie was that funny, the bloopers would probably make you pee on yourself.It's funny, funny, funny. scenes that are side splitting. His character's militaristic interaction with the young kids makes for some funny scenes. this was a great movie. I laughed all the way through from start to finish. The shooting of the bogyman through the closet door was priceless. The story of the ""Little Engine That Could"" was great. I hope that a sequel will be made where they have the blind guy and his Seeing Eye dog. That will be funny stuff. "	6.2	0
Little Odessa (1994)	also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too. haunting way of showing the true face and consequences of brutal violence. Intensively and artistically this film displays a chaotic & desperate family, a destiny very honest and very haunting. Cinematography is stunning, as is the environment, which very well defines the fundamental characteristics of this film, cold, naked, intense & raw. Great debut by the very promising James Gray. gives one of his very best performances in years. As for Edward Furlong and Tim Roth, both of whom can be very good or very bad, lets just say they haven't been this good before or since. Gray's command over such aspects of the film as pacing and visual style is impressive. The whole thing builds to a stunning climax. tragedy among the unhip and uncool.  Torn by illness and the return of a prodigal son, a Russian immigrant family in New York tries to outlast the omens promising its destruction.  The film owes something to Coppola, but you might feel the presence of Bergman, too. Unsentimental, unsparing, with brilliant performances by the principal cast. A must see. their children are - trust me on that.Violence was at a minimum for a Russian Mafia/hit-man picture, and the focus was on the family. Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son.Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia. 	6.8	0
My Crazy Life (Mi vida loca) (1993)	"in bittersweet comes from.  Even amid all the tragedy, men and women hook up with each other, babies are born, life goes on.  It's not the melodrama of ""West Side Story"", it's more a poignant look at life in the Echo.Production values lag at times but this is still a very fine movie and one of my favorites. wasn't the case and as a result, I was still entertained and moved.  Almost all the scenes take place in apartments, sidewalks and parks, so it's obvious that the film was made on a low-budget, but that small budget was put to good use and I give Allison Anders much credit.  My score:  7 (out of 10) takes you in the life of some harsh realities. With the good the bad and the babies they do the best they can with what they have. Survival is everything. Similar movies to see are Blood In Blod Out Bond By Honor, American Me, and raising Victor Vargas. These movies also focus on the ups and downs of gangster life. they ultimately will stand up for each other. They should, it seems no one else will. Great movie. Recommended as an escape movie. It will take you out of your world to a world you would probably never want to visit. Like life, it is not romanticized and it is not shown in an overly bad light. It just is. feelings he gets (disgust, superiority, sexual arousal) from selling drugs to desperate whites. Certain characters like Blue Eyes and Puppet were also interesting, but otherwise the story was pretty weak. There was an interesting attempt at carrying a feminist message but it didn't really work for me. If anyone knows of a better film about Chicano gangs, let me know. "	6.5	0
Love Affair (1994)	"last half was considerably better, with superb performances, especially from the two principals. I've never been a big Warren Beatty fan, but Annette Bening is WONDERFUL! (I think I've fallen in love!!!) -- To sum up, the first half of the movie rates a 3 in my book, the second half an 8 -- hence my overall grade of 5. the ego of Warren Beatty. The introduction is awful with annoying music score and edition. Mike Gambril is a detestable character and I do not see any reason for Terry falling in love with him. It is only good to see Ms. Katharine Hepburn in her last feature. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Segredos do Coração"" (""Secrets of the Heart"") to be the movie secondary theme.The original movie has been remade before this, and many other movie uses the original 'Love Affair' as an additional magnet to it. It isn't too hard to guess where the storyline went.But the ending still caught us in deep emotion. We strongly feel love in it.Recommended for Saturday evening movie with your spouse alone. even for a fairy tale.  This movie is beyond real! The jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place. As for the tear jerker ending, Warren can't even come close to replicating the look on Cary Grant's face when he realizes the devastating truth about Deborah Kerr.  Oh what I'd give for a really good love story! the emotion, the music... ""I love watching you move"" - just one of the great lines that don't go away and become part of our own lines! I have watched it over and over and every single time I feel the same emotions. The scenery is also wonderful from the beautiful island shoots to central park in autumn. 10/10 easily... "	5.9	0
Losing Isaiah (1995)	"a black doll, read obligatorily books about black characters, have black parents etc etc, you are starting down the same path as the Ku Klux Klan many years ago and it's not better but more of the same. To get back to the film, though, I would highly recommend it but would warn viewers of its failing as described above. very wishy-washy.  My viewing companion and her husband, who joined us at the end, liked it because they want to have a good relationship with their daughter's birth mother.  I agree with them on that, but if the movie is going to deal with legalities so much, it should resolve those legalities at the end of the movie. wrong. I am ""white"" my husband is Mexican- does our child belong with one or the other? Khaila's lawyer says, ""black babies belong with black mothers."" Is that what we want to teach? Segregation? Doesn't work for me. Babies of any color belong with the people who take care of them and love them. That's what being a parent is. works hard at being convincing as a reformed junkie. Strong support is provided by Samuel L. Jackson and LaWanda Richardson (the real-life spouse of Jackson)as Lange and Berry's attorneys, David Straithern as Lang'es husband, and Daisy Prince as Lange's daughter. No matter how hard you try to remain neutral, this film will suck you in and find you taking sides.  Fine acting all around. "	6.4	0
Madness of King George, The (1994)	"This is a sumptuous period drama which is never too intense, but at the same time never too pithy, and it makes for very pleasant viewing. The film never takes itself too seriously or gets bogged down - after all, what other 18th century costume drama can boast such lengthy discourse regarding the constitution of a British monarch's fetid stools? on. Hollywood flops big time in its Oscar choice of an actor, actress or film once in a while. It seems to me that the California-based Academy at times doesn't look as objectively and honestly at films produced outside the U.S. Nothing else produced in 1994 even came close to the outstanding acting by Hawthorne in this first rate film. ""I'm praying, goddammit!""The costumes are both faithful and sumptuous, the cinematography is luminous and the sets, borrowed at low cost from various castles and colleges, are lovingly handled. Of special note is the music of Handel, adapted so cleverly by George Fenton that one would swear the old boy in the knee breeches wrote the score himself for every scene. and Fox wonder if their American cousins were right about abolishing the monarchy. Ian Holm, as Dr. Wills, is properly a mixture of early pioneer of psychology and tyrant. A wonderful film of how a national crisis was met and overcome peacefully. And timely too. Within weeks of the recovery of George III in 1789 the Bastille fell in Paris. time is one of my favourites of all I have ever seen & always moves me.The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast is a veritable who's who of great British actors that Hollywood largely ignored. If you haven't seen this film, then I'd urge you to do so. Not many of you will fail to be impressed....... "	7.2	0
Frankenstein (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein) (1994)	" Robert De Niro is the creature!  De Niro gives the foul beast a soul of his own.  De Niro's performance brings out genuine pity, sorrow, and most importantly, fear. Kenneth Branagh has always added a bit of class to his films, and his version of Frankenstein is no different.  A visually brilliant triumph as a director. see why.  Sticking closer to the book than to any preconcieved notions of Boris Karloff (perhaps that's why), this injects true horror into the story of a medical student who brings a corpse to life.  If you don't like melodrama then maybe it's not the thing for you, but this deserves a far better reputation than it has. reason.  If you have read the book, regardless of whether you liked it or not,see this movie.  You will love what they have retained, and will embrace what they've changed.  this is not a film(not a movie, a film) for everyone.  But for those who are willing to have an open mind, it is pure bliss! this movie and equally class-dripping Bram Stoker's Dracula because he felt that they were competing in the same area.) There's the classic monsters (Robert DeNiro!), the period sets, the lovely heroines in the lovely period costumes, the beautiful and suitably turbulent score... Certainly not a perfect film, but as a classy, gorgeous monster movie, it is a woefully underrated one. 1995 and I have just saw it again on DVD, and it is a great movie that has not aged. Unfortunately I have never read the novel by Mary Shelley to compare with this version that ""is considered the most faithful film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Frankenstein de Mary Shelley"" (""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"") "	6.4	0
Man of the House (1995)	"to understand and further others brings happiness.The entire principle cast is great, but Man of the House also benefits from a number of excellent character actors, including George Wendt, Art LaFleur and Richard Portnow. Like most films, you'll enjoy Man of the House more, and get much more out of it, if you leave your expectations/preconceptions parked at the door. endearing, but what I really liked about this movie was Farrah. She still shines after all those years, in a completely engaging performance.Jonathan Taylor Thomas is perfectly precocious in his role as Fawcett's son, a boy who lost his father, and refuses to accept Chevy as an adequate substitute.It's funny, heartwarming, and genuinely sweet.It rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend :. an Indian Guide club. The actors in this movie, just crack me up. Also, the songs picked out for this movie just fit so perfectly. I love all the songs on this movie! The parts with music playing, just makes the movie even funnier some how! All I have left to say is, I love this movie! It is great! Chase and Thomas assume Native American Indian names and join a support group. They engage in some unfunny antics. Chase's out-of-control car ride is a relative highlight. Few appear to be having fun with this inefficient production, on either side of the screen.** Man of the House (1995-03-03) James Orr ~ Chevy Chase, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Farrah Fawcett, George Wendt Mostly just another story about a son and stepfather trying to bond. If nothing else, I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from ""SNL"" to this (maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie). But really, Chase has done better than this, as have Farrah Fawcett and George Wendt. Don't make it your first choice. "	5.1	0
Mixed Nuts (1994)	the sole purpose of being funny, no strings attached. It was so refreshing. As was this whole movie. Like a good dream! To me it is proof that when you have fun making it (which it appears impossible that they did not), you have fun watching it. At least I do... I'm gonna watch it tonight and appreciate it's wonderfulness. must appreciate black humor.  If you do, this is a delight.  I found it hilarious.  True, it's blasphemous and screwy and not at all politically correct.  That's a good start.  What follows is, at times, breathtaking. Three cheers for Madeline Kahn.  And for the courageous director and writer; a woman after my own heart. film, but if I had to, I would say Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. Her facial expressions are adorable and I would say that her best scene was when she finally made it to the bathroom (won't give too much away!). Rita Wilson also gave a top-notch performance as the pathetically adorably Kathryn. Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too! and other generalized problems.  Interwoven are stories of other problem folks.  It all seems to work out in a mad-cap way, and although this isn't the funniest movie, it is still very enjoyable, and worth the rent.  Lonely people at Christmas...and the ones they intend to help...all mixed in like cashews, peanuts, filberts...you get it!  Enjoy. them when you see them).Steve Martin has a great time with the role, as does Rita Wilson as Catherine O'Shaughnessy, Phil's co-worker. You'll really like the elevator scene. Great support from Madeline Kahn, Robert Klein, Juliette Lewis, Anthony LaPaglia, Rob Reiner, Adam Sandler, and Liev Schreiber make this movie truly one Christmas treat. Jon Stewart and Parker Posey also appear. 	5.4	0
Milk Money (1994)	"dad believes that she is a math tutor and the hooker believes he knows her true job.Ed Harris does a good job as the shy father, and Melanie Griffith is believable as the golden hearted hooker. But it's the kid (Michael Patrick Carter) the one who steals the show, with his winning smile and his mixture of innocence and curiosity. a director, and this adds to that.I know, the prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold context is a cliché, but this is a comedy, so it passes. And believe you me, this V (Melanie Griffith) is definitely a V for vendetta! Also starring Ed Harris, Malcolm McDowell, Casey Siemaszko, and a very young Anne Heche. Really entertaining, especially the report on the female reproductive system. so many levels. The interaction between the actors is fantastic. Even though it is more a light-hearted comedy the teenaged stars are given a realistic treatment throughout the film which is something rarely see in film. Michael Patrick Carter, Melanie Griffith and Ed Harris are all stellar. This movie is filled with wonderful enduring scenes and is truly a delight. through it all and understands and loves her for who she is"" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her ""this could hurt""...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm. she'll stay in the end, but still, don't leave. Ed Harris and Melanie Griffith also have near-perfect chemistry, it always helps if the protagonists of your romantic comedy look like they actually want to be there. ""Milk Money"" has its shortcomings because it's essentially an off-brand ""Pretty Woman"", but it's a childhood memory that I kinda cherish to this day. "	5.5	0
Miracle on 34th Street (1994)	I like her because she looks like my daughter when she was little.) Regardless, I love the way this story is told and Mara makes it for me. Even though logically she was taught that Santa was not real, as a little girl she was still willing to believe. Take a little joy in believing! I hope you enjoy :) filled with throngs of people, traffic on the bridges was stopped, all waiting for the verdict. I know NYC well, and how its people rise to such occasions. These scenes were not in the 1947 version, and I think they added a uniqueness to this version. Better, worse than the 1947 version? Neither - just different, and just as valid. trip out to a dream house in the snowy country, ushered by a silly salesman. The film does not seem to know when to call a halt, and there's not so much as Clarence's tinkling bell to bring back Kris at the close. It's as if the whole object of the exercise was to unite two bland characters in matrimony. whole family to enjoy.  A must buy for every family that enjoys Christmas. beg of you-if you have NOT seen the 1947 Black and White original, then please correct that. This is not an adequate substitute to a film that didn't need one in the first place. They even colorized the old one, so if you hate black and white, then you still have a color option without wasting your time on this. 	6.5	0
Miami Rhapsody (1995)	she hasn't moved into a successful film career by reading her lines with all the emotion of iron (although she looked great in the beach-shoot scene).Overall this is a fun little film that is quite slick if you are a fan of Woody Allen's relationship neurosis films.  If you're not then you'll probably do well to avoid this film. enjoyable, with a knockout performance by Sarah Jessica Parker and a nice jazzy soundtrack. Parker creates an interesting character, which is difficult in a movie like this because a lot of it is her reactions to everything going on around her. The supporting cast is also first-rate.  My only gripe is the title of the movie, which is meaningless. not limited to urban New York backdrops for its appreciation.Sarah Jessica Parker is outstanding, Banderas sends himself up perfectly as does Mia Farrow.  Other supporting cast is very strong, script is well-written and sparkles in places.  I can only attribute the relatively low rating to those that don't like Woody Allen movies; they surely would not like this. in the City) that really uses her talents as both as comedian and dramatist. It was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment. We may think it is overdone now with the re-runs of Sex in the City and all...but put yourself back in 1995. So Yeah...I liked it. for all others. 	5.4	0
My Family (1995)	"it should really make you laugh!  Of course, it also has its moments of tragedy but somehow everything ends up being okay.  I liked it!  It's definitely a movie that makes you feel!Esai Morales, Chucho, does an excellent job!  I think it's some of the best acting I've ever seen him do.I hope you see it! her, right there on the street. At first he doesn't want to, but the way by how she finally succeeds is really a must to see. He even asks her at the end of the dance ""Will you teach me how to salsa?"". For only this scene one should rent the video, the rest of the movie isn't bad either! positives to draw upon. The strong performances of the cast. Jimmy Smits, in particular, dominates the film with an intense and yet affecting performance. The film hardly ever succumbs to being a standard tear-jerker or phony. Instead, the film succeeds at creating a touching and provocative portrait of a family's struggles and tribulations in a world that hardly seems just. seems rather convenient they all have these different personas and political aspirations. When I first watched this film, I thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time. Instead of portraying Mexicans as lazy, this film really encompassed the cultural aspects and fears of the common Mexican man. A great film to watch, even if you aren't Mexican. Latino movies I ever see. Story is great and the problems are real. The characters are well played. If you like ""the goodfather"" here's the hispanic version! "	7.3	0
Murder in the First (1995)	"a boy get bullied at school, it just never ended and i remember feeling awful for the poor chap, the fact that it's a true story just makes me shudder. Gary Oldman gives one of the most hateful performances i've ever seen while Slater shows depth as the lawyer trying to get him out of prison as early as possible. a youthful, inexperienced attorney to perfection.In showing another side of Alcatraz the movie breaks away from typical escaped based Alcatraz films. While ""Escape from Alcatraz"" may still be the top movie in this topic area, ""Murder in the First"" provides a new twist that involves a different type of drama. Kevin Bacon was surely jilted for not being nominated here! Kevin, there's outstanding work from Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, and everybody's favorite drill sergeant, Lee Ermey...Moe Greene's kid, Marc Rocco, gets a great period feeling economically...solid work by the wardrobe and make-up units...this film deserved a much better fate at the box office and at awards season in '96...if you haven't seen this one yet, you're missing a real gem... a good popcorn movie, a morally inspiring story or the appreciation of a well-crafted piece of work. It falls a little short of ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but not far. Despite what this or any other review says, start this movie without any preconceived notions, and just go along for the ride. I think you will be surprised, happy and satisfied. of the movie. Two scenes where the music was used to great effect: the tracking shot after Henri attacked the other prisoner, and the setting up of the court room then dissolving into an aerial shot of Alcatraz.

Nobody's Fool (1994)	"in high relief. Excellent acting all around (this was one of Jessica Tandy's last films; also in the cast are Bruce Willis, a better actor than he is generally given credit for, and Melanie Griffith). The feeling of life in a down-at-the-heels northeast U.S. town in midwinter is superbly brought across; the movie has a real 'lived-in' atmosphere.A definite A+. Griffith). When son Dylan Walsh and his family moves back to town, Newman must finally come to terms with his family and take responsibilities that he has ignored for the duration of his life. Jessica Tandy shines in her swan song. A really great homage to Newman, one of Hollywood's very best from any era. 4.5 out of 5 stars. a fantastic ensemble all around, and at the centre the wonderful Jessica Tandy and the immortal Paul Newman in the role of his life. There is a point to this movie, painted in such subtle brush strokes that you just have to exclude all else and - what can I say - enjoy it, and let it warm your heart. Willis is amazing - relaxed, funny, cheating with a smile. Philip Seymour Hoffman, before stardom hit, has a hilarious role as a policeman trying to nail Sully and not having much luck.You can't really call what Newman does acting because you won't catch him doing it - he just IS Sully. He creates an unforgettable character in this must-see film. Griffith are magnetic on screen), gives them marvelous dialogue (""You're a man among men,"" Griffith tells Newman twice in the movie but with different meanings) and melts our hearts. But acting honors go to Newman, whose complex Sully becomes if not loving, then at least a responsible, functioning, vital member of the human race. And, in the end, nobody's fool. "	7.4	0
Nell (1994)	"different conclusions- some may see it, for example, as a religious allegory about the redeeming power of love, while others may view it in a more literal way. It may be too quiet and poetic for some tastes, but in my view this is an unjustly neglected work, one of the finest and most powerful films of the nineties. 10/10 where the actors involved feel real emotion about a scene. I'm willing to bet that moment of grace at the very end of the movie wasn't scripted nor acted on Jodie's part. You simply cannot get more heartfelt emotion into a scene than what was shown at the end of Nell. Brilliant and well-acted movie by all. A definite 10. is more normal: Nell or the people who want to put her away; Nell or the journalists; Nell or the boys in the bar? I will tell you: Nell, Nell and Nell. I can recommend this film to everyone and I hereby want to thank all people involved and especially Jodie Foster for her great performance. 7,5 out of 10 whole movie, and really liked it! It is well acted (Jodie Foster is INCREDIBLE), as is Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson, and it's just an all around GOOD movie. I recommend it very highly, and stopped short of giving it a ""10"" because it didn't have one of those neat what-happened-to-her title-over endings, though the ending IS a good one. it's pretty darned good.Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. Natasha Richardson also adds to this unique story. I would definitely recommend this film to first-time viewers but be wary it's different and not always pleasant to see and hear. I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort. "	6.5	0
New Jersey Drive (1995)	"you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what REALLY goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out.

SEE THIS FILM! and location.Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't ""actors"". Nothing was compromised in order to make good ""theater"". The only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people ""slept"" on it. I look forward to more works of art from Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future. and crime. Strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason. the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc.  It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan.authentic street movie 10/10 movie` ever.Its made very realistic and has a brutal story of survival and police brutality against juvenile offenders.You never get board because there's something going on every time,from start to finish,and the sound track makes it even better.Its like a documentary of juvenile delinquency,mostly car thefts,and life in the toughest black suburbs in New Jersey.Based on reality,true in every way!

Beyond Bedlam (1993)	from listening to the dead and conversing with them. At other times, Gilmour can apparently transfer himself out of his cell, and transform himself into other people.

Please, let there be no sequel to this, please! death with Gilmour in the past finds out and tries to stop her.Too late. The drug enables Gilmour to make his dreams become real. He never leaves his cell, but is manipulating the world around them, using their guilt and fears to terrorize them.It all sound a little preposterous, and it is confusing to follow.

Craig Kelly then i must say thats a pretty good reason, at least u know there's one bit u will enjoy, because quite frankly the rest of it is a pile or c**p and not worth the bother.

Nemesis 2: Nebula (1995)	"in a half-drunk, don't-quite-know-what's-going-on state of mind. The action scenes are a tad flat, and of course there is a whole encyclopedia of cliches, but if you except if for a low-budget action movie, which it most definitely is, then you just sit back and enjoy it. It's crap, but it's good crap, and at least it can admit it. non-stop action and narrative force, and it's awfully reminiscent of both ""The Terminator"" (in its ""messianic"" myth) and ""The Predator"" (in the look of the monster that pursues the heroine). But as B-movies go it's still somewhat above average, and Sue Price, the starring female bodybuilder, is not only impressively built but very appealing, too.     (**) that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't shown yet on DVD :-( explosions, without ever really explaining what it was all about. Luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something silly and phony going on at all times!Terrible movies are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it's truly entertaining. Rent this film, or buy it even, you won't be disappointed! the hunter has got a lot more technical options (radar, infra-red, audio scanning, laser, whatever), his prey stands no chance normally, but has a strong survival instinct. The ending titles already announce Nemesis 3: Time lapse"". I watched the 4 Nemesis movies (which I watched first in the 1990s) again now in chronological order for my reviews and voted 7/7/5/5.

If you liked Laura in Quigley Down Under, and Pretty Woman, you'll love her here.  Her sweet, vulnerable, yet strong and assertive personality shines as does her comedic ability. This is a terrific date movie--for married folks.  Don't miss it. ... then again, from what we see today at the movies or on TV, maybe it would be accepted. For sure, watching this movie would make you want to try when you see the end results. I enjoyed every minute of it. The TV guide only had two and a half stars against it. I would have given it four!!! James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher, and in writer-director Simon Moore's 1992 `Under Suspicion' with Liam Neeson (a very good who dunnit with twists after twists and. . .more). Paul Rhys was in Robert Altman's 1990 ""Vincent and Theo"" with Tim Roth and Johanna Ter Steege (she was the disappearing wife in George Sluizer's 1988 Dutch film ""The Vanishing"".) woman and carried off the part nicely.  Fisher Stevens added to the sleaze factor of it all.  What I liked was the romance evolved and didn't go straight into sex scenes.  A believable film about two people who are attracted to each other and because both spouses are gone- follow their hearts- though they are breaking vows. my opinion, that is generous. The script is slow, the dialogue juvenile & tacky and, while the actors do their best with it, the performances are most definitely lacking. If you want a ""realistic"" feeling movie about infidelity, try ""Unfaithful"" with Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Well written, spectacularly acted & far closer to real than ""Nina Takes a Lover."" "	5.6	0
Natural Born Killers (1994)	"Well-crafted film holds your interest by making social points that are poignant, provocative, at times even satirical, but alas, they're set in the midst of noisy and excessive action scenes that are relentless and headache-inducing, not to mention extremely violent. Cast is good, especially Harrelson and Lewis who make a good match, but they need much more sturdy direction. ** take another look at.In this day and age, violence on television is becoming more and more commonplace, and this movie's relevance seems to make its viewing that much more important.  Before we go and continue to bash the hell out of it again, people need to come back and take a look around themselves and watch ""Natural Born Killers."" will make you love it and hate it. Combining the brilliant early writing skills of Tarantino, Oliver Stone's addiction to violence with the brilliant performance of Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and all the supporting cast(Rodney Dangerfield, Robert Downey Jr, Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones). Fantastic soundtrack and graphics. It's THE eye opener. The ultimate 90's movie. It's a ride! stunning.  It is intensely colorful, unflinchingly violent and innovative in its cinematography. This movie is not for most, but if you decide to try it out, be warned:  It is not for the faint of heart, and not for the weak of stomach.  But it is an important film for its visual merits, at the very least.--Shelly and especially Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden are great too. Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, although he was not too happy with the result in the end, this is one of the best satires I have seen. May be it is not for everyone, the images are not always that nice, but the meaning must be for everyone. "	7.3	0

Tomei is so beautiful in this film, it's understandable why Robert Downey Jr's character falls in love with her at first sight. The Italian scenery is incredible and would make anyone fall in love with Italy. I have since visited this beautiful country and can attest to its romantic atmosphere.

Once Were Warriors (1994)	it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence, and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is, it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long, long time. My highest recommendation. are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.  The youngest daughter is simply too small and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to re-create a form of family life.  A very powerful film, not for the faint of heart.  Morrison as Jake is one of film's most fearsome characters, full of true anger & hate but by no means a one-dimensional character.  As see the characteristics that made Beth fall in love with him in the first place, the passion, the charisma. A great script based on the novel of the same name. A must see 10/10 had the privilege of seeing it yet, then I highly recommend that you do so. George Henare's stirring Taiaha scene alone is well worth the cost of getting the movie out.(A Taiaha is a Maori spear. To use one of these, one must have immense mana, or importance. As Henare's character said, the British *feared* the highly skilled Taiaha warriors.) right along with the characters, and you will find it hard not to restart the movie just to watch it again.This is just one of the few movies that stayed with me all these years, since first seeing it back in 1995. I will never forget this movie, and if you watch it, I can guarantee that neither will you. 	7.9	1
Poison Ivy II (1996)	not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself? is quite predictable and rather slow but there is no doubt that Alyssa Milano looked extremely cute & beautiful and totally the movie belonged to her.Sex scenes in the movie are rather unconventional but interesting.So inspite of having nothing the movie lives to its B-grade sex-flicks standard and as far as Alyssa fans are considered its a feast for them. everything else in between made sense to me. This isn't a bad sequel,, i thought the original was better, but this one was more sensual, and had more depth to it sexually than the first. This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic, storyline.  I recommend that you see both films.Poison Ivy 2:  Lily is Rated R for strong sexuality and nudity, adult language, and for some violence.NOTE:  Poison Ivy 2:  Lily was released in two versions:  an R Rated version that trims some sex scenes, and an UNRATED version that contains two more minutes of sexual sequences. plot. 	4.4	0

It's a race against time as they try and locate the host animal carrying the virus, as well as save the lives of the town inhabitants before his Army superiors can carry out their own agenda. Suspenseful, well-crafted thriller is not always surprising, but it is believable and acted with conviction by a dynamite cast. *** and though the cd is short in time, it's a time I cannot forget. Particularly the end theme when it's chopper vs. plane time. What a song, keeps me in suspense every time. I like songs that are taken for film trailers as well. It's still too bad not a lot of people know about this movie.9 out of 10 to enjoy.  But what struck me the most was the cast.  I mean, this is about as good a list of actors that you will ever find in one movie, and they all deliver, just as you would expect from all this talent.  It's truly one of the most exciting movies that I've seen in some time. (Sutherland).Great acting from its talented cast and superb storytelling make a well made film which hooks you into waiting for the final outcome. Story doesn't focus on the effects of the virus, but rather the hunt for the cure, which makes a far better film.You want a hotshot scope-jockey, fine, but, frankly, I'm hurt.  Maj. Casey Schuler (Kevin Spacey) very good films since his beginnings in Germany with ¨The Neverending story¨ and ¨Das Boot¨ ,after that , he emigrated US where realized ¨Night of shattered crystals¨, ¨Enemy mine¨ , and the successful ¨Air Force one¨and ¨The patriot¨ , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake ¨Poseidon¨.

Perez Family, The (1995)	"not just pick up where they left off.It is a pleasant romantic comedy and has some very funny moments as well as an excellent cast, particularly Marisa Tomei, who pretty much drives the whole movie as the young Cuban female who tries to create a close family (with others similarly named Perez) and searching out something like an ""American Dream."" Alfred Molina is good but not as effective as his leading ladies. Chazz Palminteri is charming. The late Celia Cruz makes a pleasantly awkward appearance.'The Perez Family' is quite a charming and funny romantic comedy that gives us a glimpse of the hardships of immigrant life but also lots to laugh about. Would like to see Nair make more comedy. force the rhythm for all it is worth and here is no different.  It starts out boasting historical context and spice, falls into a rather convoluted series of plot twists that end up taking the film down a rom-com road to a solution that, although badly delivered, unthinkable and out-of-nowhere, was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film. want. Marisa Tomei was wonderful. that little sarcastic eyeroll he does when he talks about, ""Cowboys . . . and Indians!""Overall it's just such a sweet heartwarming film which is such a change from the usual ""the more depressing the more deep and artistic"" immigration film.

Leguizamo's straight man. The plot works great for me, with Baldwins odd behavior providing much of the thrust. I love the great Old New York feel the film has, which largely comes from the bakery and Sergio. In short i really love everything about this movie. Go watch it. Its on TV often enough, and a DVD recently popped up. give this a 10 out of 10 in the category of the romantic comedy.The casting is superb. Armin Mueller-Stahl is awesome as always. Joan Plowright, John Leguizamo, Sadie Frost. Each is simply perfect for their characters, and the characters are so varied and interesting.

Pulp Fiction (1994)	are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.

Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it. 	8.9	1

The most powerful message this film sends is that the Panther Party was the result of a need not simply a desire.The film may not be 'completely historically accurate;' however it does present a different view of the Panther Party and its objectives, one that is long overdue.

Priest (1994)	Yes, the film is controversial, you may not agree with some of the ideas and it looks sometimes as a cinema manifest, but it is still a good and human film. I less liked the final, which is the only place in the script where art logic seems to surrender to the religious concepts.  9/10 on my personal scale. of the movie. Tom Wilkinson, as ever, gives a performance that is as natural and believable - and likable - as anything he's done before or since. (Side note: having waited so long to watch this it's interesting to see these two actors with important roles in this year's new and glorious Batman Begins.) A truly remarkable and emotional film. a double life. Being a 'liberal' priest and breaking his vow of celibacy at the same time. But WHO are the hypocrites?

All in all, an excellent film. Watch it with an open mind, and a keen artistic eye. His performance is outstanding. Very thought provoking movie. makes you think for weeks afterward about guilt and redemption. I gave it 10/10.

Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their real-life counterparts, to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life, but to reflect on real life, to gain fresh insight, and ""Quiz Show"" achieves that purpose with dignity and style. film. But I know every film has a hater or two. But for me the film, acting wise, the film went to Ralph Fiennes, he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury. I just would highly recommend this film to anyone, this is a great film and Robert Redford did a terrific job.10/10  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.

The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see! like to think...... but ""Gaijin"", sadly, doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is ""A Thousand Pieces of Gold"". This was set over the Chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad, starred Rosalind Chao, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dun. felt the petty impulse to begrudge the few (very few) slightly misleading geographical and historical moments in the film.

Queen Margot (La Reine Margot) (1994)	Catholics and Protestants whilst surviving assassination attempts (usually via poison) and overcome tragedy as those who they care for are systematically murdered. Indeed if nothing else La Reine Margot' provides a chilling insight into one of history's most horrific atrocities and offers an unsettling portrait of the moral bankruptcy that pervaded throughout 16th century society.My Score: 8 out of 10 get where she wants, not even if she has to see her sons being killed one by one and sell her daughter in a convenient marriage to unite the Catholics and the Protestants.  The others, especially Asia Argento, impersonating the tragic countess Charlotte de Sauve  did a good job too.  A very well deserved Prix du Jury. This film only becomes better on repeat viewings. I found I was able to grasp more on my second viewing. There is so much going on, so many twists and turns and shocks, and the film is also quite long. It never lags, and even Margot's grudging tolerance, if not love, for her husband, is believingly portrayed. Very highly recommended. French Alexandre Dumas, placed in the 16th century, directed by one of France's best directors and acted by some of the most wonderful French actors and actresses of the last decades? Would you want to see this film in English? Sorry, but I think you would be missing a great deal of the depth and emotion of this unique film!!! as spacious as the loo. The film fades a bit in the second half, but it's still not a bad story, if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found `Elizabeth' more interesting and a lot less bloody. Anyway, `Margo' is very French, and not to be judged by Hollywood standards (whatever they are). 	7.5	1
Roommates (1995)	"indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed.

This movie touched me deeply. It's a real sleeper. the main characters. And DB Sweeny shows that he can have a softer side, as well as a wise cracking smooth talking side. It was a little bit of a stretch from what he is normally known for doing, but he pulled it off very well. Roommates is definitely going into my collection. I give this one 8/10. Bravo guys. fails to touch me - even after quite a few viewings! at an old age, until illness forces him to retire.

I think that is what is so great about this movie. This crusty old man really grows on you and it's hard to let him go at the end.This movie is definitely worth renting if you get the chance.

I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.  I was aching for her and Marcello Mastrioanni to interact.The ending is truly fantastic. It is very well directed and filmed. It's a good film. he could have pulled off the same feel and frenzied little European farce with a TOUCH more connective tissue in the plot. Not a lot, just a little for the audience to care about the story, the characters and whatnot. The thing I found in the film that I even cared more than a fig about was the Simone storyline. `We don't know what he looks like,' the detective complains.  `But we know what he was wearing.'  Every conversation, every plot, each detail is so thoroughly self-referencing to fashion; but mostly, there are dozens of funny moments.  Even the red herring of murder is based on our mistaking an innocent fashion item for an omen of death. in my opinion. I think the film, overall, is woefully under-rated. I feel like everyone got caught up in the idea of ""ALTMAN"" and then got confused by ""THE STARS"" and then didn't really bother to look at the movie, which has some lovely grace and is well worth the time. Then again, why listen to me, I liked Ishtar.  But it was just a hoot to watch.  I died every time Richard E. Grant came on the screen -- he's a phenomenal character actor.  I say, lighten up!

Three Colors: Red (Trois couleurs: Rouge) (1994)	"multinational co-production, with a Polish director, mixed Swiss and French cast and crew, Red was not allowed to compete for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar as a film from Switzerland. Indeed, the trilogy itself is without a country as it transcends borders and even culture in its solemn inquiry into human nature and that is a prize in itself. to imagine that ""Red"" was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed! them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream. Sadly that would become a reality as the famed director would die in 1996, still in his mid-50s. Krzysztof Kieslowski's works are highly deep and very philosophical in all major respects. His trilogy was a fitting conclusion to a wonderful career and ""Red"" is a crowning achievement to one the finest film-makers who ever lived. 4.5 out of 5 stars. a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom... and yawning, wonder what all the excitement is about.

Three Colors: Blue (Trois couleurs: Bleu) (1993)	"a commitment by the audience to really consider Kieslowski's implications, for he is telling us (throughout this trilogy) what he thinks makes a ""good"" person.

Kieslowski was one of the most talented directors, I really admired his 'Trois couleurs' trilogy but I think,'Bleu' was his most powerful film.10/10 Blue feels like a documentary and looks like a dismal Rembrandt. While Kieslowski concentrates on showing the true nature of Julie through action, Idziak contributes by showing her through light and color.Trois Couleurs: Blue is an almost unmatched achievement in the history of cinema. Never before has a character been conveyed so splendidly and in such a visually stunning manner. the piece of music which her husband has been commissioned to write... The result is a work that has less in common with the Polish 'Cinema of moral concern' of the late 1970s than with the tradition of the mainstream European art cinema, in its concerns with alienation and the loss of feeling, countered by the transcendent power of love... you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process.

Three Colors: White (Trois couleurs: Blanc) (1994)	"not the actors but the directors. Great music. Great photography. And a very intelligent script.This is a major film of the nineties--providing superb wholesome entertainment and food for thought. The film deservedly won Kieslowski the ""best director"" award at the Berlin Film festival in 1994. It is sad for the world of cinema that Kieslowski is no longer with us. not mistaken, it entirely changes the resolution of this film for the worse.  That's too bad.  ""White"" works best on its own, as a pessimistic movie, without the more optimistic outlook of ""Red"" grafted on in retrospect.  But since both films are so great on their own, I'm not too bothered by their failure to gel properly. of sincere homage to Kieslovski's art: ""Kieslowski is a director who draws his inspiration from the true life of people, who instills his own soul into his movie, who dwells upon the details as if he wanted to examine the life under a microscope."" Absolutely true. There is nothing else left to say: ""Three colors: red"" looms on the horizon. some brilliantly fitting music, plus slow motion is used very effectively. There are ideas about love, equality and revenge, the plot is intriguing, and there are some very intense moments, making it another solid entry in the trilogy, even if it is not as critically acclaimed as the first film, 'Trois Couleurs: Bleu' or the last film, 'Trois Couleurs: Rouge'. word, requires at least two people.  The central quest for liberty is personal; the struggle for equality is fundamentally social. White is the most conventional of the three Color films, and while it is still one of my ten top films of 1994, I rate it an 8, slightly less than the highly visual Blue and the mind-bending Red.

Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker (Pao Da Shuang Deng) (1994)	It's not the drama of Farewell my Concubine or Emperor and the Assassin, nor anything along the lines of Chungking Express or any kind of action fighting films.  It's not a crushingly tragic film either, btw, as one might worry from the poster of the girl with the pained look.  It's a simple story, and it works well. film is slow and the action is largely a matter of allusion, which makes it a difficult film for Western audiences; but the fiery nature of the two main characters ... the opposing colours red and green ... result in clashes and regrets in quick succession.As useful for a glimpse of life in an alien culture as for anything else.  You will not forget this film. The key is these individuals do _not_ fit into the roles they have been assigned.  And not only does the viewer get to watch the unfolding story, but one is treated to cinematography from a non-Hollywood point of view.  This is one I would love to see on the big screen.  One of my most favourite films.  Rarely did I see any character act in a manner that I expected.  I find this very refreshing in a movie if a bit confusing.  I liked the story and sympathized with the characters.  I found the film style and quality to be good or above average. I  give it a 7 out of 10. 	7.0	0

It certainly opened the lines of communication with us. in the family.I really feel it has nice interpretation of kids' difficulties who have troubles with having integration to family life, and well, I am pretty sure I will be somewhat clueless when it comes to dealing with kids like the parents.Brilliant movie? Not. Worth to see? Of course, give it a chance. Don't get fooled by the low rating. together. The other kids were good too.There was plenty of physical comedy, and nothing to concern parents. The closest this movie ever got to PG: Russ and Valerie were 'interrupted', but of course younger kids wouldn't know what they were getting ready to do in bed.This was fluff and somewhat predictable, but it was the kind of movie I enjoy.

Perphas what is notable for the movie, it is one of the earlier written scripts by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen, The Recruit).

Stuart Saves His Family (1995)	"unfamiliar with the 12-step junkie will find a sweet and surprisingly honest story here -- one that both pokes fun at self-help groups and acknowledges that they can work. There are plenty of laughs; and in its treatment of Stuart's highly dysfunctional family of origin, this film achieves something near-great. Watch and see. And ""get yourself to a pound cake!"" be a good movie. On the other hand, it wasn't tastelessly laugh-out-loud funny. In fact, I only remember laughing once in the whole movie.So did ""Stuart Saves His Family"" accomplish its goal, or did it fail miserably? I'm not quite sure. I still don't know what to think of this movie. I'd say it's worth renting just for its uniqueness. more than it misses. If you have a dysfunctional family or can identify with any of Stuart's relatives, it's worth the hour and a half....While it won't win any awards, it should be worth an hour and a half of your time... I give it 6/10 for the average person.... 8/10 if you have a highly diversified and dysfunctional family. Hollywood movie, this would be a romantic-interest scene, because everyone knows you can't have a male and female star in a movie without their getting together. Well, here it's that incredibly rare thing: a scene of genuine friendship and support, with Stuart's sexuality left out of the question. To me, that's more impressive than if they got into a liplock. the butt of the joke. Al Franken is very good and the character is given more subtlety than he had on SNL. Vincent D'Onofrio plays his younger brother, Harris Yulin his father, Shirley Knight his mother and Lesley Boone his sister. Laura San Giacomo and Julia Sweeney also co-star as Stuart's friends. Not a great movie, but a nice one. "	5.3	0
Swan Princess, The (1994)	"the first one for me. There is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. The difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began yearning for the first one and wishing I'd never set eyes on the third.Do yourself and favor and don't waste your time. the kids I would honestly say it's a go. It's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so I'm going to cut the film some slack. It was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, I grew up with the first one, so I guess it was just stuck in my head.4/10 Jean Bob is noticeable, and is sorely missed. The dialogue is not always involving, particularly when Derek says ""I'm not going to lose Odette."" And like the Secret of the Castle, the overall film is too short, and not helped by the silly romance between Rogers and Zelda. In conclusion, a flawed but much better second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox. (not voices remain).  Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread.

This is a lovely drama featuring a child rather than a kid's movie, but it works on either level. so common with most American child characters.  Imagine being told an old family story by your favorite Uncle or Grandfather while sitting around a living room late at night, with only the low light provided by the glow of a fire or one old lamp so nothing distracts your imagination's journey.  That is what this film is like... any bad performances at all.The Secret of Roan Inish features some beautiful Irish music, both instrumental and Irish-language, and of course features lush cinematography of the Donegal area and coast.  Beautifully shot, wonderfully written and performed, and masterfully directed, The Secret of Roan Inish will delight everyone in the family.  Don't hesitate to buy or rent this one.  With the music and the intricate storytelling, one can become truly lost in this story.  And truly a part of it.  If I had children, this is one movie I would have them watch over and over again.  Like Disney's ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"" this is a movie to entertain children of all ages. told so vividly, so beautifully, that it held my 6 and 9 year old daughters rapt in spite of the fact that it did not resemble a Disney Channel video.Anyone who can appreciate folklore tales should love this movie.

To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure.

It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night! it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt.

If you have no such memories, you may not understand this movie. Thumbs up to Tim Allen and Judge Reinhold! Thanks for the happy tears! in the way of family entertainment, the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before-- but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10. a holiday classic. Great for the family. 10/10! and I love when he burned the roast! I also thought the actor who played Bernard the elf was very funny and stole every scene he was in. And I especially enjoyed Judge Reinhold's turn as Neal Miller. I love the scene where he finally gets the hot dog whistle he'd wanted since he was a kid! Great holiday fun! I also laughed when he imitated cats and dogs fighting. Oh, man, those parts were funny! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Tim Allen has scored huge!""

Shallow Grave (1994)	"and stylish film made on a small budget, driven by a cleaver story and interesting characters.  Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccleston both give great performances in this film.  `Shallow Grave' is miles better than any thriller Hollywood has come up with in the last 10-15 years (if not longer).  I give it an 8 out of 10. the virtuosity of ""Trainspotting"" here, his trademarks are all present: the fast pace, the urban background beats, the enthralling camera angles and so forth.The three leads are all great, but there's no question about who the movie belongs to: Ewan McGregor is energetic, powerful and photogenic in his portrayal of a young journalist. No wonder he became such a star. done with style and clever wit, with a couple of nice twists that I doubt anyone will see coming.  (Although, I'm a little hazy on just HOW it ends up that way.)

A landmark film of the '90s gone unnoticed! his directly opposite physical type. The filmmakers  seem to expect the audience to be able to watch the movie on more than one level. The story allows the audience to consider the obvious questions about the  nature of identity, but the stylization allows the audience to consider the different  questions about the nature of the film experience. fantastic job. Some of the compositions and the overall cinematography are also handled with skill with some shots being smartly composed. What really made a lasting impression was the way the film handles reality, and the reality that the camera sees. Don't let the silly title and the black and white film stock keep you away from this unique movie. the other as a pawn for his devious scheme involving murder and mistaken identity.  If I could mention two scenes that reminded me of Hitchcock, it would be these: 1) the first scene that sets up the film, and 2) Vincent explaining his dreams to a psychiatrist--reminiscent of ""Spellbound.""  This is an excellent thriller that should be seen. visual aspect of the film alone is worth a watch.

Yet superb performances by the two male leads eventually move beyond stereotypes they  and the audience  initially share about each other, transforming their unexpected friendship into a statement that puts the lie to official groupthink in a repressive regime. in a way: by his friendship with Diego, David begins to think, develops a maturity of spirit - and is also, at last, able to develop a loving and mature relationship with a woman. It is very sweet when he tells Diego: ""No-one will hurt her. She is with me.""A true gem of a film. I recommend it to everyone. movie, and nothing that you need to hide from the kids.

Swimming with Sharks (1995)	"and its message can be construed either as darkly humorous satire against Hollywood, or as a nihilistic comment on the ways of mankind.  Judging by the not-so-humorous tone of the movie (though ludicrously enough it was marketed as a comedy), to me it feels like the latter applies.  Definitely worth seeing, even if only for Spacey.  8/10 to clichés. The ending is a punch in the stomach, I never expected it.Whaley is good at playing the over/underwhelmed everyman and the direction is OK (if just so). The best aspects are the witty script and Kevin Spacey's scene-stealing performance; together he has good chemistry with Whaley and the movie succeeds based on the actors' success in their roles. out of three characters ""win"". Huang seems to be suggesting that the professional world ain't likely to change any time soon, and that even if you try to change it or manipulate the game itself, you're likely to just get eaten up by it, processed by it and incorporated into it anyway. Again, I can't say I disagree with him. and the desperate and confused Guy, but ultimately good does not prevail, and the shooting and Buddy's manipulation of the situation remove us from both characters as the film ends.All in all, Swimming with Sharks is an enjoyable film. The simple plot and small cast are compensated for by some fine performances; it's funny , well-acted, and definitely worth watching. Swimming with Sharks is about delusion and corruption, and how much the human spirit can take. It just happens to be set in Hollywood, but Buddy Ackerman could be Gordon Gecko in a different market. Worth watching to see Spacey enjoying himself in a role where he gets to say pretty much whatever he likes, and does so with relish. "	7.1	0

(For other references to similar scenarios, see MURIEL'S WEDDING, SWEETIE and of course, MOULIN ROUGE.)But for me, it's a rare-look back at the kind of risk-taking that Russell may never again explore in his career.

But add to that some truly stunning views of Sydney, some great comedy, and a really charming romance between the father and a woman he met through a dating service, and you have one of the great cinematic delights of the 1990s. See this film and you will be glad you did. borders on bland. The most surprising thing you can say about it is not the (discreet) man-on-man make-out scenes, but rather the fact it's Russell Crowe acting in them.

It filled the void where drama and action films had worn away movie goers in the mid 90s.  Watch for Tommy Chong as the bus driver and the chemistry, whether electrified or jaded between the characters. his movie isn't bad. Lots of laughs, but no enlightening philosophy. It is a great movie for large gatherings. It's not as great as Animal House, but then, what is? this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments, but they are rare and limited.

The assassin, Travis, Star Trek fan, manipulator of the young and all around comedy fall guy. These actors are the ones who make us laugh.

Even if you don't, see this movie anyway - it may change your mind about this genre.From personal experience: ""Chicks dig this flick."" Get the popcorn & enjoy. right off, I was too busy enjoying the ride. But if you look at all of the characters, it's the women who are strong, and all of the male characters are either villains or are defective in some way (1/2 human Rippers).It was (and is) one of my favourite flicks and I can be very critical of badly done movies. movies. Instead of the usual male buddies, you have two sassy young woman, while a genetically modified and not very bright kangaroo plays the part of the Bond girl.

Get over it.) creating characters from underneath their Ripper make-up... they're so good that one of the best parts of Tank Girl is just watching and listening to them.This isn't a movie to go into with high expectations.  Read all the negative comments, take them to heart, and then watch the movie anyway.  It will make Tank Girl a pleasant surprise. (it IS difficult) so it bombed but it acquired a cult following.

Tales from the Hood (1995)	"succeeds. It has things to say about racism in our society and says them in ways in which they've never been said before. Though definitely not for all tastes, TALES FROM THE HOOD is a surprisingly solid horror anthology.* *Cast Note: Clarence Williams III, who plays the funeral director, is best known as Linc from THE MOD SQUAD television series. In the film's most powerful sequence, Cundieff serves up a quickly cut montage of unsettling images culled from a number of state historical archives depicting vicious, stomach-churning lynchings meant to deter the rapacious young killer from wanting to harm any more people.  It's potent stuff, and makes one wish the rest of the film had this kind of intensity. time honored tradition of horror/exploitation movies everywhere, the guilty are punished with gory deaths and lessons are learned (frequently too late). Is it preachy, didactic social satire? Perhaps, at times. But it's also entertaining as hell. It has a great cast, some really cheesy, over-top-the-top acting, and was produced by Spike Lee. For me, that makes it almost required viewing. so scary is that it is true and that nothing is being done about it. The issue of gang violence is something that really needs to be addressed.""Tales from the Hood"" is a very good movie no doubt, despite its flaws. But you need to watch this movie, not expecting a horror film, but a very important social studies lesson. of horror, Tales remembers to keep its monsters metaphorical. Police brutality, domestic violence, racial profiling, and gang violence are the most hideous creatures found here. I complement Rusty Cundieff on a job well done there. Excessive campiness and at-times generic camera work keep this from being great, but nothing stops its relevance in the genre.STAR RATING: *** out of 4. "	6.3	0

It's one of those movies that takes it's time to grow on you.7/10 since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms. However Carpenter's US town sees the children uniformly garbed with no reason, other than to draw attention to their uniformity in a massively clumsy and illogical visual device.Take my advice, watch the original and avoid this. It's one strictly for carpenter fanatics, not people who are simply fans of his work. fundamentalists appear to confront the children. All we're missing is a fat burgomeister in lederhosen.The eyeball effects are good, adding color change to the original glow (which effect, by the way, still stands up in the B/W version).

This movie is unashamedly stupid, but if you'll just relax it's also one of the funniest films you'll ever see.Ok, it has a paper-thin plot, but it does contain some cinematic firsts: a moose breaking its way out of a classic car; Rob Lowe being electrocuted through his pecker; a fat man in a little coat.See this film. Twice so much fun. If you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit to his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick! "	7.1	0

Avoiding the common temptation of drawing out the play's anguished characters at a snail's pace, Malle also paces the film well, with an emphasis on lightness and subtlety of delivery - the result is both intellectually and emotionally satisfying. do together. I never believed so many giggles and gasps and stutters and excited silences could be so finely woven, tossed so lightly. This is really, really good stuff, very smart. So far as an intelligent construction you won't see a superior. I never expect to see four levels at once again in film at least centered in the acting. via Wally Shawn's cup which has I Love NY written on it then later Andre explains to the visitors (who, I suspect, have been planted there for just that purpose) that it's now a different time. The acting throughout is beyond praise and a wonderful high note for Louis Malle to end his career. 10 out of 10 going away. Both of those films place the play on an inner level of the film's overall plot, and thus they try to teach us the inner workings of the plays themselves and acting as an art on the whole. Anyway, since I am tired and no longer in control of my thoughts, per se, I will just say 10/10, goodnight everybody! "	7.5	1
Underneath (1995)	"work out what the weaknesses with them were.  Add to this a quite straightforward story that is told in three timelines for no discernible benefit to the film and then a cheap series of dramatics when all else fails and you've got a film that doesn't tend to get mentioned in the same breath as his more recent hits. to a local hood (William Fichtner), a fact she neglected to tell him.To get out of trouble with the hood, he agrees to do an armored car robbery. His own brother (Adam Trese) suspects him.One of director Steven Soderbergh's early works, it will not blow you away, but it will entertain you. I suspect the ending will leave you furious. And, the most I could say for the climax was that it did.  But it also spiraled into a conventional, predictable, and altogether disappointing ending.  I walked away unhappy with the whole experience.  This was the first time I was disappointed with Soderbergh's work, so for a more satisfying experience, in a similar genre, see The Limey. Malone (T. Azimuth Schwitters) as the guy who attempts to hit on Allison Elliott in the club and is rebuffed, and David Jensen (Elmo Oxygen) as the satellite dish installer.

Our protagonist, Mr. Johnny Depp did his usual amazing work, but it is the performance by Leo that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again.

""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is an excellent movie! Gilbert's own life. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town. The performances of Johnny Depp, Leonardo Dicaprio, Darlene Cates and Juliette Lewis are unmatched and truly wonderful. It is a film woven together with comedy, drama, love and everyday emotion, perfected with beautiful cinematography and superb directing. events in the story. And the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her mother make things interesting for Gilbert. The ending is unexpected, very solid and sad.

Virtuosity (1995)	series. But where other films in the genre have used such tools as wit and plot to keep the more intelligent of the viewers amused, this film, um, hasn't.The script is terrible. The acting (excluding Crowe, who only gets away with it thanks to a camp smile and some fortunate direction) is wooden. And the plot is illogical and frustrating. are many other ideas or methods that could have really made this movie something but of course this did not happen. It went for cheap effects, an over used clichéd storyline with a little bit of a twist. That may work for some people but not for me.I'am giving this movie a 6/10 rating because it had so much potential. killing machine.  There are some humorous moments, somewhat lessening the overall dark and somber tone. On the down side, the ending may be a little too pat and leave a few loose ends untied.  Recommended for science fiction and action movie fans who are on the lookout for lesser known films that may satisfy them for an evening. did an excellent job of portraying the demented cyber villain. I especially liked Denzel Washington, who always manages to be believable in his role when he doesn't try to be a soul brotha.' Granted, the cinematography was pretty average as well as the music, but then again, the performance of the two main stars really made this film a winner. effects. Not really. The cast is good, and Crowe turns in a solid (if a bit hammy, but most bad guys are, aren't they?) performance. Washington is no better or worse than usual, which means the real culprit is the script here. Do yourself a favor and wait for a two-for-one night at your video store to see this one. 	5.6	0
While You Were Sleeping (1995)	believe Bullock as well. He then starts to fall in love with her and vice versa.

The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.

You can watch it a million times and never get tired of it. **** It's like you've seen it all before, but Sandra makes you want to see it again.

Double Happiness (1994)	"subtlety in the way writer/director Mina Shum presents Jade's nervous breakdown of a life, a subtlety which craftily creates the effect of slowly drawing the viewer into the spiralling life of Jade.  With its powerful, yet simplistic (in the Hal Hartley vein) direction and tremendous performances, Double Happiness stands as a remarkable film which deserves more attention.  Pity! at the outcome of this pairing.I was very impressed by Callum Rennie, who played Jade's caucasian boyfriend Mark. There's a quite funny scene between these two that involves a talk about bad clam chowder and ""fascist"" bouncers. The chemistry/tension between Jade and Mark was great. The rest of the family was great too. Truly a must see movie about relationships. and he's as awkward, sweet, and appealing as ever.  The interstitial scenes of characters speaking to the camera are an interesting experiment--a good tool for revealing character, they nevertheless are sometimes jarring.  Overall, the film is like a compact colorful flower:  it won't dominate the landscape but it richly awards the lucky soul whose attention it captures. of two cultures would bring.  As the child of an Asian father and American mother (but raised almost entirely American, I'll admit), I found that scene very interesting.I think this film was wonderful, and that one need not have a particular interest in Asian families to appreciate the family and social relationships, conflicts, and hopes portrayed in Double Happiness. with other user's comments that the film is too myopic.  This movie obviously deals with very personal feelings, and I would only expect Mina Shum to create a film reflecting her point of view. To make it far-reaching and covering several other viewpoints would dilute the film's vision and make it seem less honest and direct than it does. "	7.1	0

I'm glad that it was produced in Australia.  If it had been done in France then Hollywood would have done a remake in English and probably ruined it. value. Her feelings are so true to her heart and I am sure many can relate. Griffith's character is portrayed with such humor and honesty.

Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995)	"I also missed some faves from the books (I always enjoyed Kristy's older brothers, whenever they showed up, and some of my favorite charges were missing.) but i know that not every character could be cast - finding ways to involve each one would result in an insanely long movie. Overall, it's cute. But I'll take the books any day. for Kyla Pratt, Scarlett Pomers (""I've been to the moon!""), Larisa Oleynik, Rachael Leigh Cook, Marla Sokoloff, and Austin O'Brien.  So all in all I've chosen to look past the cheese and realize that this movie is just a G-rated romp about friendship that really isn't a waste of your afternoon to watch.  7 stars out of 10. played Stacey(april 3rd is her birthday like mine) is beautiful but i haven't seen her before. The girl who played the shy and sensitive MaryAnne was also a cutie but haven't seen her before. The girl who played Dawn,I've seen her in 10 things i hate about you. I can't believe how young she looked. I gave it a 10. in Stoneybrook.On top of that, Claudia has summer school, Mary Anne is the only person to know the truth about Kristy and Alan Gray (stupid jerky dweeb extraordinaire) is trying to date Dawn using tips from Logan.  And diabetic Anastasia Elizabeth McGill is in love with a guy four years her senior.That's pretty much the books done for you revolved around homework, best friends and relishing in the freedom of the summer hols.One thing, however, that struck me while watching the film.

At that age, I'd be hiring a babysitter for *them* since they're as young as the kids they babysit! "	5.8	0

Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will quickly find it tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **½ into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim. without Carrey (Albeit, they're not many of them) really just shows this movie doesn't have much else going for it besides the man himself. Many of the other actors/actresses (Including Courtney Cox) just aren't funny. But this movie, in my opinion, deserves an 8, because it's just really showcasing Jim Carreys excellence.

The musical numbers are worth watching alone, but combined with the story and all the sub-plots and the funniest lines I have heard in a long time (The ABBA turd convo cracks me up every time), this is a movie to buy and watch over and over when you need to be entertained as well as dazzled!!!!!!! of my life! I wasn't the least bit uptight about it (as some people were turned off by the flamboyant behaviour and distasteful jokes, which I found refreshingly great!), and delighted in the campy antics of this fantastic trio! It's a beautiful, feel-good comedy that I recommend to anyone with a catty sense of humour (and a VERY open mind). about the nutty folks out there. the costumes are great and gobsmacking, they perform very well in the musical numbers.I showed this to my mum, after the initial shock she was very amused and agreed with me that it was a very funny movie.I will watch this movie a lot in the future, why?? It keeps me laughing every time. "	7.5	1
Bitter Moon (1992)	"movie arouses a range of emotions from dread to empathy to disgust to hilarity.  The story line is far too complicated to synopsize appropriately in this review. Bitter moon is a great film, one of this reviewer's top 10 for the 1990s. Another must see!  A word of caution, however, Bitter Moon is not a good date movie. fact that it oversteps the mark on several occasions, Polanski's film always feels real and the lesson in the love that the film teaches is duly noted. Bitter Moon is a film that will get under your skin and stay there and not only that but there's enough happening to ensure that this is always a fun watch.

Bullets Over Broadway (1994)	"cast members of the play in production. Mary Louise Parker and Harvey Fierstein, Rob Reiner are also seen in smaller roles.""Bullets over Broadway"", as most of Mr. Allen's films has a great musical score of the jazz songs of the era. Mr. Allen, in taking a seat behind the camera, delivers one of his best and funniest films to date. actors who do the traditional Woody role  he gives a slight impression at times rather than cutting out the role as his own.Overall Woody Allen may not be everyone's cup of tea  but for fans this is him at his whimsical best.  Not a classic comedy but a warm Allen film that sparkles in nearly every scene. the plot, amazing performances, authentic feel of the era and great musical score. ""Bullets over Broadway"" is pure delight from the beginning to the end. The best I could describe the film - to paraphrase the famous line from John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address: ""Ask not what Art can do for you — ask what you can do for Art"".9.5/10 gangster who becomes also playwright from a certain moment on. Some of his interventions lack authenticity. But this is only a minor flaw in the whole. Like all the other Woody Allen's movies this one seems superficial at first sight but it's well made and deep enough to amuse us and simultaneously make us think and feel life in it. Allen, with customary finesse, affectionately transports us back to the glitzy, gin-peddling era of Prohibition and slick Runyonesque antics.I remember the times when the opening of a new Woody Allen film was a main event.  As such, ""Bullets Over Broadway"" is a comedy valentine to such days. In any respect, it's a winner all the way, especially for Woodyphiles. "	7.5	1
Clear and Present Danger (1994)	"he is equally at ease with the quiet parts and the loud ones, particularly an RPG-powered car ambush centerpiece. The action beats are used sparingly but with brilliant precision.All in all, this is smart, tight, believable and expertly executed. It is that rare brainy ""action"" film that will involve you and have you hanging on the edge of your seat. and Henry Czerny and Miguel Sandoval - not big names but recognizable and good actors. The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific. The best action scene was shootout in the streets with snipers firing at cars below. The positives are far more than the negatives, making this a solid thriller. fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this. film is perfectly balanced so that there is not a single boring scene in the picture. The wheels are constantly turning to make sure something dramatic is happening to really draw you further into the picture. I recommend this movie as well as it's two predecessors, ""The Hunt for Red October"", and ""Patriot Games"". Both of which are equally brilliant. Félix Cortez who has inside info in the White House and plans of his own.It's an intriguing political espionage mixed with some well executed action scenes. The ambush in Bogota is terrific action.

It's really pretty good. But the cast is so outstanding that any weakness in the story is the more highly illuminated. See it, if only to see the range of facial expressions into which Jones is able to fashion his face. this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old.Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10. a perfect fit as the ""Revered"" Roy Foltrigg.  Will Patton as Sergent Hardy, was an excellent sleezy and conniving officer.When I saw Anthony LaPaglia as Barry ""The Blade"" Muldano, I didn't envision the greasy sleezeball he portrayed, but someone more tougher or perhaps more thuggish.

An endearing little treasure, 'Corrina, Corrina' is a motion picture filled with heart and laughter, that's sure to send your spirits soaring.

Rating: Three 1/2 out of Five Stars (Very Good). to be seen in ""Waterworld"") was just as impressive. But the theme of two minority groups (Jewish and Negro) coming together in the way they did was done in absolutely good taste and a delight to any liberal thinking viewers.

His dollying techniques (placing actors on dollies), lens choice, and manipulation of color conspire to add special characteristics to this film.

The odd struggle and perceptions of reality that we all face coming up...the embarrassment of a family, the neighborhood bully, etc....all gets played out in this summer classic.--Not to mention the cinematography is wonderful and interesting. of the film revolves around - even if she has less than Troy.Tonally the film doesn't quite click.

Cobb (1994)	"Face in Batman Forever. Let that sink in for a minute. Robert Wuhl plays himself as he always does. The movie is entertaining in spots. The comedic parts work better than the dramatic. I can't really recommend it because the bad outweighs the good and, personally, knowing about Stump leaves a bad taste in my mouth over the whole thing. part about it is that now you have millions of people who watched it thinking it was all true, which in return has besmirched this person's name. I would never watch this garbage again even if you paid me. Don't waste your time or money. It's all a bunch of bull, and it's not even that great of a movie. it is to the real Cobb, but regardless of this it is a really enjoyable character piece with a great central performance.  It keeps the audience by swinging wildly between the comic, the dark and the tragic, keeping us with it all the time.  It is a dark drama but still enjoyable and sadly great underrated and underseen. also circle the bases faster than anyone who has ever played the game, with his spikes sharpened.

We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both.

A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks.

Entertaining, pleasant and funny, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10. blunder in execution, we make utter fools of ourselves, and yet we don't give up.  We still strive.  We still search for that perfect someone.  And the glory is -- sometimes we get lucky.Going along on this quest with Grant and friends is as enjoyable an entertainment as you're lucky to find in your local DVD section. These are some very talented people. As a fan of British humor, I am especially pleased with the incredible writing along with the acting. Not to mention some of the scenery. If someone is feeling low, this is a great movie to watch to lift the spirits. I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting or needing a good laugh. emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth, loud, extrovert and excessively hearty (like most characters Callow plays).To sum up, this was a very good film indeed; proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 8/10 is at a wedding and is seated with all of his ex-girlfriends. The scene is set up for utter humiliation. Even with the quick-witted characters, and all the weddings, it wouldn't be a movie without that touch of drama that for many might just get a tear out of them.Hands down all around great movie to fit most every occasion. 	7.1	0
Higher Learning (1995)	"notion that he will be partial to the black characters?So where a lot of people seem to think the message is black=good white=evil, I see it as It doesn't matter who's wrong and who's right because we need to put our differences aside and get along (almost equally clichee, I know, but still a different message entirely) Signed, white dude with real issues like racism and date rape and drunken behaviour. It's refreshing because colleges are usually shown as places where nice middle-class kids never have any problem bigger than being dumped by their boyfriends before everything is resolved in the last reel.An overly maligned movie. Not perfect but better than a million other college movies. Loved the ending too. and scenarios.  The film tries to go all deep and the final shot of the word `unlearn' against an American flag just feels like Singleton must have thought that he had been making incredibly profound points the whole time - instead it felt that his original idea had had a deeper point, but it was totally lost in delivery. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you'll find ""Higher Learning"" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10 message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.

I Like It Like That (1994)	"that low.   This film has terrific acting, great characters and a couple - and their young son - who you just root for.  Add to that a strong supporting ensemble, and I would unashamedly rate it a 9 out of 10.  i do have to see it again, but I remember just really 'digging' this film! guts it took to not give this movie a fairy-tale ending.  We have no miraculous resolution, but instead a hard-fought and bittersweet partial reconciliation.  The acting and writing here carry a good film to a satisfying conclusion.  I'm tempted to vote higher than I really feel to boost this movie's overall rating, which I feel is undeserved. a man, his performance as ""Alexis"" showed a depth that few actors ever accomplish.  In addition to his sterling performance as ""Tudee"" in ""Follow Me Home"", his portrayal in this film convinced me of his tremendous range.

I Love Trouble (1994)	"some scenes and the cuts between them.  The only problem here is that once the same trick is employed more than once or twice it becomes a little tiresome.We're left with a very standard piece of work, but one that works just hard enough to keep it relatively entertaining but not quite memorable, even for Nolte and Roberts fans. not hopping into bed within the first half hour (in refreshing contrast to most modern films), leaving a little time for storytelling and character development.This is definitely describable as a ""flick"" (for guys or chicks); its spirit is in keeping with its title. Personally, I'm a great Julia Roberts fan. This isn't her best picture but, nevertheless, it's quite watchable. click, mainly because the lines in the script are so stale. The picture looks expensive, and the plot isn't a con (I suppose it is fully thought out), but who even wants to see Julia Roberts in a Tracy-Hepburn knock-off like this? And who wants to see her kissing Nick Nolte? The whole concept is, well, Troubled. *1/2 from **** don't see what's the point of both Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson keeping out-scooping each other.Nevertheless, until the first hour the movie is okay and contains some good humor. Besides, Nick Nolte is great as Peter Brackett and Julia Roberts is not bad as Sabrina Peterson.Overall, not a great movie, but certainly not as bad as they make it sound. made what could have been an okay mystery-comedy into total enjoyment.

I really enjoyed this film quite a bit and I hope that you will too.  Thanks for reading,-Chris Predictable every step of the way, and hard to believe (though it's purportedly based on a true story), but it's so well-performed, so irresistibly charming, so sweet and romantic that you really don't mind. Not only a good showcase for the film's three ideal leads, but also a kindhearted film that gives hope to the notion of human decency. *** Although you wonder why Cage married her in the first place, she gives a humorous and entertaining performance. Of course there's kitsch but that's not necessarily bad. Good kitsch can be wonderful and this film, that has an absolutely great happy ending, serves as a perfect example of how a romantic comedy should be filmed. It's better than ""Pretty Woman"". demands of a furious Muriel; if despite reaching a financial and emotional low they can still invite Angel in to put some food in his belly; and if the New York public can show their appreciation by doing whatever little they can to help out; then maybe, just maybe, there might be hope for the rest of us.This.

Until that point, sports were something you did or read about. You might go to a contest purely for the association of the thing.What her art did, incidentally, was she made sports cinematic. And we may all be the worse for it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. I had the benefit of second-guessing the subtitles as well.  Some were wildly wrong, and none could capture the tonal nuances, the careful phrasing, and the subtle interplay between Mueller and Riefenstahl as they parried one another's verbal thrusts.  While far less original and profound than the master's work being discussed, Mueller did a very creditable job here. the winning side of the war, according to Ms. Riefenstahl, a tough old broad who was apparently ecstatic about being interviewed. Up to a point.This is a top-notch documentary. The cinematography is gorgeous. The probing questions are important. Riefenstahl is alternately combative, charming, evasive . . . and a whole lot of other things.I give it a 9 of 10. of work but reveals many of innovative techniques she pioneered. Her accomplishments are all the more impressive when one considers the role of women in her heyday.However, the most interesting aspect of this film for me is how this intelligent woman (still lucid in her 90's) deals with queries about her political involvement during the National Socialist period in Germany. as a movie maker was finished. Had she been working for the equally repulsive dictator Joseph Stalin a finding that she was a Communist sympathizer would not have hurt her as much as the Russians were on the winning side.

Lion King, The (1994)	"is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout. almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata! are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++ voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10. a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age.

In fact, Scorsese rips this movie off dreadfully, even to the same wiping out of the sand pattern at the end. on his quest for enlightenment.As for the rest of the movie, well, it just dragged in a lot of places and the characters just were not all that believable.If you know little or nothing about Tibetan Buddhism and would like to get a sense of it without getting into heavy dogma and spiritual practice, this movie is a nice intro. much.The movie is also beautiful to watch. The cinematography, the editing and the direction combine to provide just the right dramatic tension to a movie whose pacing is deceptive, in that it seems slow, but is not. The ultimate result is that a viewer who allows it, will find him or herself transported for a little while, to unexpected places. for nothing else, it is worth watching for the beautiful scenes.  I was fascinated watching Keanu as Siddhartha. He really seemed to lose himself in the role. I would really recommend this movie when you are in the mood for something gentle, beautiful to look at and at the same time, providing an interesting insight into the Buddhist world. the coolly modern Seattle (by giving it a blue tint) and the older, earthier India and Nepal (shot with an orange and red theme).  Chris Isaak turns in a subtle and tender performance as the conflicted Dean Conrad.Ruocheng Ying's performance as Lama Norbu is superb.

Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close).

In short, Harpo's stories (e.g. several ""croquet fanatic"" episodes) offer a telling comedic counterpoint to Mrs. Parker's almost continually cynical and self-pitying pathos.  Read Harpo's book to balance out the negative.

The cast is first-rate, particularly Campbell Scott. It is a very quotable movie, full of venomous one-liners, most courtesy of Mrs. Parker.

Mrs. Parker's only comfort in life is the friendship she has with Bob Benchley (an excellent Campbell Scott).  Leigh,  speaking with a facinating accent,  brings sadness and cynicism to Mrs Parker with perfection. is frustrating to only hear snippets of their lines. I suppose the idea was to toss these famous lines away to add naturalism. However, without spotlighting the conversations of the legendary characters, however contrived this might be performed, this is just a very sad movie about a bitter, unhappy, self-destructive, unproductive writer. Not very easy to watch nor very interesting. "	6.4	0

No, there's not a lot going on here, but the all-star cast makes it worth a peek. is unforgettable as the head of a rival paper. This group of actors may very well comprise one of the most talented ensembles of the 1990s.It's a shame THE PAPER has never received the attention it deserved. Had it been released 50 years ago, in a less cluttered era, it would most certainly be widely hailed as a classic today. Ron Howard.Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the ""stop the presses"" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast.

Mel Gibson's otherwise rubbish ""Whast Women Want"").I saw this in the cinema, and own it on DVD - it features in my regular rotation, and it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, it is still good viewing. A sign of a classic film is how often one can view it without finding scope for criticism - nothing yet! it's like to be working in the newspaper business, with deadlines, dealing with superiors and the things you have to go through sometimes in order to get the job done.

""knowledge and education are power"" but are not taught that credibility and respect are things which must be earned and that very few people actually start out at the top of the career ladder.Overall, this continues to be one of my favorite films and I appreciate the myriad of messages that it sends, though they may, at times, be contradictory. and Janeane Garofalo is stunning as the low self-esteem serial one night stander with the AIDS paranoia and over-full shag book.  Also, great cameos from the Soul Asylum geezer and Evan Dando's stunning turn during the end credits add to the film.  Overall a stunning film, admittedly which will probably only be appreciated by a relatively narrow demographic. a flat with a guy who mooches off me, sleeping around with strangers, dancing at the gas station, etc. The movies have a lot more influence on young people than one thinks. In my gut, I felt two things: a-My parents would be horrified if I brought friends like that around and more frighteningly, b-I secretly would agree with them. with each viewing.  It's routinely panned for reasons that I really can't comprehend. It's witty, well-acted, quickly paced.  I notice that people don't talk as badly about it anymore.

So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche? to criticize with this one.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch.I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show. charming, so I usually do.The movie pokes fun at the super rich on a superficial level, but that's all right. I'll save the harshly critical movies for a different mood. There's some lovely views of the Biltmore estate. There's light ribbing of the corporate world. Oh dear, I'm falling asleep. I'll miss the end of the movie. Too many brewskies. that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help. He combines emotional and rational qualities without violating his basic identity as a kid. To me, that's all good, and redeems the entertainment value of this movie for a young audience. and the family's fortune, so he tries to kill mum and dad -Ritchie needs the other kids's help to save the company, his parents and his fortune aided by The butler.Not a bad movie it has a very good moral story (all the money in the world can't make you happy)- But strictlty for KIDS or easily amused adultsRating 7/10 	5.3	0

Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain.

Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow.

I also liked the opening scene and the scene in which he goes back to 1929 to arrest his partner. maniacal at times.Mia Sara is engaging and looks beautiful as ever.Bruce McGill has some funny bits as Van Dammes Boss.The very sexy Gloria Ruben also shows up as Walkers new partner.Timecop is not the greatest when it comes to plot-holes.But unlike the recent version of HG Wells Time machine, it is a very fun movie.And one of Van Dammes best. set out to achieve...value for your $12.95 whatever. Certainly no cerebral rush, but honest entertainment nonetheless. I rather doubt the Van Damme brigade were looking for some kinda kick-ass Yoda with nunchukas. Hyams delivered his requisite quota of high kicks per dollar and exploding blood capsules per reel.The imdb rating for this film is laughable...it rates a minimum of 6.6! and untrustworthy characters, too many of them. There also is too much Rambo-mentality and the final action goes on way too long. The time travel ange of the story may be intelligent but the dialog in this movie is just plain dumb and too juvenile.Overall, this is one of the best of a small group of well-done Van Damme movies. made a solid attempt at a story, it had decent special effects and sound effects, the acting was as good as van damme gets, and the action was good. Perhaps if he had made a few more of this caliber he might have become a more stable box office draw rather than the queen of straight to video punch-and-kick drivel. 	5.8	0
True Lies (1994)	"on an urban rampage.  This film is a work of genius.  How an action/espionage/romance spoof could deliver such outrageous tongue-in-cheek and yet never feel like corn, slap or déjà vu is a mystery to me.  I give this 8/10 for being relentlessly entertaining, at a very high level.  And the acting is top notch all around. YES!!!The resulting film has Arnie chasing motorcycles on horseback through hotels all the way to ""borrowing"" Harrier jets from the military. And, of course, getting his wife and daughter back.Packed with awesome action scenes and some really terrific hilarious moments this is what an action movie should be. Not too serious and not too pointless. 8/10Rated R: violence and profanity ""wife side track, story-line"" I guess I'm one of the few that doesn't mind it at all and actually find it an extra addition to the story.The movie has everything a good action movie need: A believable action hero, explosions, chases, gun fights, a stereotype villain and a high entertainment value.I wish more action movies like this would be made.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ alternates action with comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger, his partner Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton are hilarious, with very funny liens and situations. Jamie Lee Curtis is not only funny, but also extremely sexy and hot, and I love when she says that she married Rambo. The special effects in the action scenes are stunning. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""True Lies"" Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being ""you're fired!"" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.

When a Man Loves a Woman (1994)	"stated, ""Now HE frustrated me"".  I said, ""I was frustrated too, but BY HER"".  This movie really pegs male and female relationships.Superbly written, superbly acted. It hurts to watch it, but a movie that can evoke real emotion and not pander to the audience with contrived plot lines is a great movie.  THIS is a great movie. if this makes much sense (I feel my thoughts are jumbled).  In one simple statement: SEE THIS MOVIE.  THE TITLE DOES NOT ACCURATELY DISPLAY THE MOVIE IT TRULY IS.  The title makes it sound like another sappy love story.  What the viewer gets is a tremendous study of the damage alcoholism can bring to a family. moving is the wonderfulperformance of the elder child ""Jessie"" - an amazing achievementin one so young. It certainly strengthened my resolve never to godown that path again. I recommend it to all families of alcoholicsfor an insight into our way of thinking - our shame, our inability tocontrol our own addiction, and the possibilty of real recovery.Thank you, all involved. see many reflections of my sister and I in Meg Ryan's daughters.  Both her and Andy Garcia's performances were outstanding.  I would recommend this movie if you have personally dealt with alcholism, or if you have been the victim of someone's abuse, because it helped me come to terms with some issues that I had been struggling with. scene for the 1st time, will definitely fall for it.I`m not going to ""yeap"" about this movie. It is so good(at least I liked it) that I ended up buying it. By now, I have rewatched it a few time and I still didn`t or couldn`t get ""over it"".

Wolf (1994)	"direction, intelligent and wonderfully paced script, with excellent performances from Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Wolf makes a wonderful modern take on the Wolf Man classic right down to the facial prosthetics, and is easily worth seeing for any fans of the genre in the mood for a horror film which refuses to patronise its audience - a very refreshing change. -8/10 doesn't hurt to ogle Michelle Pfeiffer.Even though the profanity is pretty low for a '90s film, when it's there it's needless. They could could have done this movie, believe it or not, without any and it still would have been good. I'm not complaining. I still recommend this, but not for people who are looking for an action--packed vampire film. animal inside like he does. Pfieffer's character is, although formulaic, a relief among all the hard-assed men of this film. The ending is a bit silly, but nonetheless odd and intriguing.Yep.I like this movie. It's fun to watch and it's great to see Nicholson act like the animal we all really think he is but don't dare to find out. it. The story perfectly combines drama, horror and romance, with Michelle Pfeiffer very beautiful and a great dispute among the characters performed by Jack Nicholson, James Spader and Christopher Plummer. The conclusion is open to interpretation whether the wild side of Laura Alden is transforming her or the sexual intercourse with Will Randall. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Lobo"" (""Wolf"") audience is quite small.  Fans of Nicholson's usual drama fare dislike the movie for its horror content, and fans of violent horror dislike the movie because it's lacking in action and gore.  But if you like thoughtful horror that has more brains than blood, you're part of the small group of people who'll get something out of this. "	6.2	0
Wyatt Earp (1994)	"Pullman, Sizemore, Rossellini, Williams and O'Hara.Overall this is a film that requires patience - if you prefer your films to contain action more than story then Tombstone may be more for you - but, for all it's failings, this is still a solid western and a good telling of the legend with more emphasis on background than action and fluidity. Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film. If you're not a stickler like I am for total historical accuracy, you should enjoy the film. low-key, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story, rather than simply showing it to us.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys epic stories, wonderful acting (particularly Dennis Quaid, although Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen are excellent as well), and visually compelling shots. Do not let the length dissuade you: Kasdan's film is well worth the three hours. EARP was a major box office failure when released, and it never achieved the 'Classic' stature TOMBSTONE has, over the years. But it isn't a bad film, and Kasdan should be credited for his willingness to take an original look at a Western legend. It will be interesting to hear his comments, if a 'Director's Cut' DVD is ever released! and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them. This one is no different, and was likely made for a viewer like me, and not the mainstream audience.It's very ambitious, and successful, I believe, on its artistic merits. Whether it's ""entertainment"" for the masses, well that's another story altogether, and that story's name is probably ""Tombstone."" "	6.7	0

Gia Carides has a key supporting role as the judge's mistress who later acts out her part of a woman bent on payback. Remainder of the cast is okay and the tech credits are fine. adds dimension to the movie.Laurence Fishburne, as the cool Nelson Crowe, is a major asset to the picture. So is Ellen Barkin, an actress that is always good to watch and is sadly missed from the screen, as she hasn't made a film in years. Frank Langella, Michael Beach, and above all, Gia Carides, made tremendous contribution to the film. portrayed by Daniel Hugh Kelly.His elegantly evil performance is so deliciously smarmy that it was obviously created for the sole purpose of providing that wicked grin that I spoke of before.If you consider yourself more trip-hop than hip-hop,more Oscar De La Renta than Old Navy,more Paris in the spring than Peoria in the summer,then this is the film for you! Fishburne is excellent as the amoral Crowe, Frank Langella is elegantly nasty as Grimes, and Michael Beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of Fishburne's ""co-workers"". A very dark film that resolves itself quite nicely in the end, and well worth seeing. But if you need a good guy to root for, this isn't the film to check out. "	5.4	0
Man of No Importance, A (1994)	"great period detail and some lovely funny and touching and dark scenes, but the film IS Albert Finney - a momentous performance as a gay man desperate to consummate his passion for a man he knows he cannot have, and desperate also to create beautiful things in a grey, humdrum world which just doesn't understand him. Finney is absolutely fantastic. who are ""bigger than life"", but he can also quite effectively play ordinary people. I recommend the reviewer check out the following films: Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Two for the Road, Charlie Bubbles, The Browning Version, Shoot the Moon, Rich in Love, The Playboys, Erin Brockovich, Gumshoe, The Run of the Country, Endless Game, Picasso Summer, and The Image. once.  All of the acting is very effective, and the story is believable. A rare thing in movies.  This would be a good double bill for 'My Beautiful Laundrette'.  Odd that Indian's present homosexuality believably in English films, but I have never scene an Indian film even portray homosexuality (and, yes, I have seen many Indian films).

The end seems kind of glued to it all, a little sad-a little happy, but more than anything a disappointing meaningless ending for an incomplete movie. Albert Finney and Brenda Fricker deserve much better. is so professional,that you can ""FEEL""Dublin beneath your feet and before your eyes...and the city did feel better back then..before the Celtic Tiger came and went.A bus man in Dublin attempts to eke more out of his hum-drum life,by following his dream of ""the theater""and his life becomes full when he meets so many different characters.This is a must see!

This way, you had to wait until the end of the movie to find out what happened at the beginning. Makes it all the more intriguing.  I love this movie, and most people would too if they gave it half a chance. scathingly commentates on the media's ability to warp and distort truth, and to give the mundane deep meaning. Cliff Spab is a meaningless person trapped in a meaningless society that does not appreciate the horror of his ordeal and ruthlessly tries to cash in on his pain. This film is chock-full of meaning and irony, and it is simply brilliant. throughout this movie amazed me, and I notice something new everytime I watch it.  SFW is based on the book 'Madison Heights Syndrom', and even though I've never read the book, I'm sure they did a great job adapting it.   There was not one thing about this movie I didn't like and would recommend it to everybody. blame the actors for their terrible performances since they had very little to work with from the writing. What I can't believe are the reviewers who rave about this movie. Were we watching the same thing? Were you high? Oh right, given the content, you probably were. Please don't ever waste your time watching this, unless you are contemplating suicide. and although we are led to believe Spab did something spectacular, the later flashbacks reveal why he is unwilling to assume the mantle of hero and why he seems to be in a bad mood most of the time!. A great film that depicts a classic anti-hero with more than adequate back-up from the script and cast. Watch it soon!. 	5.9	0
Low Down Dirty Shame, A (1994)	like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be. equally on both counts. Watch this film, you will not be disappointed. since about 2001.So Samuel Jackson's Shaft gets a x-million dollars promo, and still can't come up with an interesting story (although it was nice to see Richard roundtree on the screen again).Meanwhile, let's talk about entertainment - alright, there are some bits that don't work; but enough do to keep the film moving. I had good time; what the heck. I can't!..the whole movie was a BLAST & if you haven't seen it yet you're wasting time..seriously! It's one of the best films in the comedy/action genre & fans of both individual genres WON'T be disappointed either..so if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favour & check it out you won't regret it! 10 out of 10 stars! sequences and stick a lot of funny s*** along the way.  Jada Pinkett lives up to comedic expectations as the sexy but tough assistant to Shame as Peaches.  It's a good action-comedy to rent, but put the kids to bed before you watch it.

Don't miss it. technique merged with an excellent art direction which brings you back to the ""classic era"" with the Greek beauty patterns.The puppets are extremely well sculpted and the movie presents itself like an ancient arena theater, with great light/shadow effects and of course, Greek drama. All of this combined makes Achilles one of the most charming short movies I've ever seen. and his relationship with his lover, Petroclus, during the trojan war. The scenes are played out through montage as well as action sequences and tableaus, culminating in the untimely deaths of the two heroes. Never before has an historical homosexual relationship been so delicately portrayed without prejudice or judgement. Considering this is animation, that is a tremendous feat. Astonishing stuff! fight. angry, pain, revenge, the apotheotic end. the temptation to see it again and again is not small. because the director has the gift to resurrect the Greece who you only imagine in the history class as answer to the words of Homer.and your images from the youth become alive in delicate, splendid manner. so, a film as time trip.

And then try to sleep well that night... the morality of his choice of renunciation)--white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco--over the riches he leaves to his wife, and her and society's dishonor.

Derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst of people he says to Chabert when he takes the case. This speech's original place is at the end of the novella as Balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony. really of value in life. My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy, wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family. Somehow that artifice makes the film a bit less emotionally powerful than it might be. But I'd certainly see it again. "	7.0	0
Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965)	"fills the screen with sharp dialogue (""Breast or thigh, darlin'?"") and sharp camerawork. There is no nudity, since Meyer was trying to circumvent the censors in 1966, but there are some incredibly sexy scenes all the same. Excitement and laughs abound in this straight-faced send-up of action-flick conventions. This celebrated cult classic is one big-breasted Gothic melodrama-satire that really...um...stands out! single unforgettable mythic figure. Similarly the vastly underrated Stuart Lancaster is the very personification of sleazy misogyny. Add to this the brilliant build-up of the opening monologue, Meyer's masterful editing and Jack Moran's eminently quotable and often hilariously funny camp dialogue and you have a trash film masterpiece that just gets better and better the more times you watch it. and entertaining movies made in the 1960s, and continues to amuse and inspire right into the 21st Century. Every time I watch this movie I am knocked out. This is a bona fide cult classic that gets better and better as the years go by. Absolutely essential viewing for anyone who loves exploitation movies, The Sixties, rock'n'roll and/or buxom babes! the leads will always make it memorable; the fact that they've got big breasts only makes that more so. This is an absolute cult classic and, I suspect, a film that I'll be seeing over and over again. This is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed - so make sure you don't miss it! taken in the right way the combination of trailer-park chic, retro-hysteria, and ultra-attitude is a lot of fun... and when the pussycats hit the screen you may think you're about to get a black eye, and I don't mean from their fists!

Unforgettable.Highly recommended, but keep in mind that there is grit, drugs and depictions of violence in this movie. give electrifying performances. One of the strongest issues the film dealt with was Payne's relationship as a brother to troubled Woodbine. The disturbing part for me though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his family.A brilliant film, I can't recommend this film enough. 8/10 that happen. The characters are very well developed and, while the movie doesn't justify Josh's actions, it does convey compassion for him. It also provides new insight on what it's really like to live in a ghetto. If you can find this movie (after all, I saw it on Showtime and haven't the video in any stores) totally see it!!!! cast shine. film enhanced the whole. ""Jason"" gave me hope that a man can commit in a relationship; he just has to want to do it.  He made me dream again of lovely words and warm embraces.

The characters don't really speak so much as mumble, which, along with the jerky motion, adds to the un-ease.All in all, this movie stands right up there with David Lynch and Jan Svankmajer films as a twisted masterpiece. had the chance to see this excellent piece of animation and I truly enjoyed it. For all those interested in clay/latex animation (Aardman style) the s/fx are awesome.As for the storytelling: absolutely wicked !

I was also moved by Tom's innocence and non-judgemental nature, despite the horrors and tragedies that surrounded him. are jerky and clumsy, and the clay-mation is smooth and fluid.

My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Ventos do Deserto' ('Desert Winds') Heather Graham were never uninteresting to watch and listen to as they tentatively revealed themselves to each other across a huge chasm.  The whole idea and concept was intriguing.  While Nickles still has a way to go as a writer, he clearly is on his way there and I will definitely be interested in whatever else he does. thought the movie was OK. It had themes about following your heart and desires and encouraging others to do the same. I also thought it was too slow in some places, but that wasn't too bad. It had nice touches of romance and good conversations between the too leads. It was a decent movie at best.** 1/2 out of **** agree with the other poster's comment that it allowed the two principal characters to develop an intimacy that would have been unlikely otherwise.Those looking for plot development or action needn't bother.  This is a study of two characters and how they get to know each other in an unusual way.  It's a nice alternative to most Hollywood crap.  The rest of the movie consists of a couple of dreary sex scenes (no, Heather is not included) and Graham and Nickles having short supposedly meaningful conversations with their parents.   While I find Ms. Graham as alluring as the next guy, I suspect most viewers, like me, will find this movie a handy nonchemical substitute for Sominex. 	5.8	0

Better than Chasers and Under Siege. McNamara is much better in this than he was in Chasers, where he played a Tom Cruise wannabe. In this these to are a couple, who've just met, on the lam.

Homage (1995)	"work?""Homage"" is an interesting drama, with a story in he style of a documentary with the incident disclosed in the beginning, flashbacks and the persons involved interviewed along the film. The conclusion with the vigilante act of a correct police officer shows how people do not believe in the justice system.

A chilling insightful movie about people either trying to find themselves or run away into fantasy.

Mirage (1995)	with it. Even a decent performance from Edward James Olmos, who I've never really cared much for. The rest of the cast was utterly forgettable. They badly needed a better actor to play Lt. Randazzo. Decent photography and evocation of the Coachella Valley. Overall, it's worth checking out on cable if you like Sean Young. Otherwise, skip it. Grade: C- a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions. Young is better, but still a poor substitute for Kim Novak. 	5.0	0

Federal Hill (1994)	"seen it yet.... rent it.. buy it.. watch it.. get some haven brothers and watch it.... I had a lot of laughs watching these guys run around the state to places that I can relate to... everything from food spots to night clubs.. I love the scene when Nicky cooks for his girlfriend.. really funny.. it reminds me of myself.. originality within his compositions, while he is able to make something fresh with use of closeups. A feeling is generated that the Federal Hill district has its distinctive persona, and incisive dialogue binds a viewer's attention to Ralphie and Nicky's widely variable states of mind in a film that carves a niche for its cinematic métier and for its director. a Mean Streets copy but this is smarter than that and while painting a convincing community it delivers a couple of characters that are more complex than they appear and hold the interest as a result. The performances mainly do what is required but a couple are better than that  in particular a layered delivery from Turturro as Ralph. gay! Take a good look at the relationship between Raplph and Nicky while you watch the film. I believe Ralph seems prejudice towards gay people to hide the fact that he is. An excellent independent film, Federal Hill was shot in Providence, Rhode Island. Good acting, great direction, and a powerful story, It is one of Nicholas Turturro's best performances. okay. I never thought about Nicky and Ralphy's relationship and you are right, now I think about it, Ralph seem very jealous of Nicky's relationship with a woman. A lot foul language and tough acts throughout the film...typical of hoodlum type of movies. I like to get the ""run you away"" theme song of the movie...can't seem to find it. "	6.3	0

At times the film can be extremely scary. The old trick of using darkness and shadows to convey creepiness that Carpenter's so good at are present and good as ever. ""In the mouth of madness"" pulled all the right strings and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.8/10.Oh, and great ending. in a sea of un-reality.  Julie Carmen is also very good in her role.  Look for Charlton Heston as a publisher and Bernie Casey in a cameo as well.  Kudos to Mr. Carpenter for bringing his visions of horror to the silver screen once again.  This may be his best film...certainly his most thought-provoking and sophisticated. the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter.The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10. great as I find this movie petrifying.The production of the film isn't great and there are more exciting films out there. But if you have some imagination, are a little romantic and like being scared without having to sit through some poor soul forced to spectate live at their own autopsy, then this deserves every one of its eight stars.

8 Seconds (1994)	job of playing Lane Frost. While it is not entirely factual, it does give a fairly accurate description of life in the rodeo. This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. If you don't like bulls, dirt, and the cowboy way..... don't rent this movie. However it is a must see for any rodeo fan. as a sport with the formation of the Professional Bull Riders. It's champion in 1995 was none other than Tuff Hedeman. And in 1996 Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost with both inducted in the PBR Ring of Honor, the equivalent of their Hall of Fame. It's a good biographical picture and should have gotten much more attention than it did. is a nice film to watch with the family. I suppose if you cannot connect with the American West, or horses, or rodeos, you may want to leave this film alone, but otherwise it is a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood car chases, gun fights, sex and cheap jokes.My hat comes off to Lane Frost, a person to admire. was actually quite good. The story of ill-fated bullrider Lane Frost met my expectations and featured just the right amount of romance, drama, rodeo scenes, action, tear-jerking scenes, and country singer cameos to suit most needs. I liked Luke Perry's performance, and Cynthia Geary's wasn't bad. If you see this, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.*** out of **** Oklahoma bull rider Lane Frost. Hard work and faith led to winning the 1987 PRCA Bull Riding World Championship before rodeo finally took his young life. Perry is very believable leading the cast that also features:Cynthia Geary, Stephen Baldwin and Red Mitchell. Some country dance tunes by Brooks & Dunn and Vince Gill. Worthwhile and recommended for the whole family. 	6.5	0

There were other former R&B stars who starred in the movie but only had small parts. To wrap it up in a nutshell Above the rim to me is one of the most memorable urban basketball movies I've ever saw. features Duane Martin, Tonya Pinkins,Marlon Wayans,Bernie Mac,Leon and the late great rapper/actor Tupac Shakur(2Pac). Here you can see why Tupac was highly respected not only as a celebrated gangsta rapper,but also a great actor with an impaccable skill and broad range and here in this movie you see why. A film that is not to be missed. Rating:***** five stars. movies in this genre,and this movie also contains some real cool basketball scenes. are celebrated a lot more in the black community than anywhere else.

Still, it's got a lot of action packed exciting basketball scenes in it. While it's not a basketball movie, any fan of basketball should enjoy it.Overall it's a good movie.

I doubt anyone else could play the part of ""the black widow"" quite as well, with just the right mix of sleaze and slapstick. Her deranged laughter alone is worth half the rental fee.It may not be a classic but it is solid entertainment, with few if any weak passages. Go and see it! front-row seat. Peter MacNichol (Ally McBeal) and Christine Baranski (The Ref) have a ball as the irritating summer camp counslers and Christina Ricci will probably never top her performance as Wednesday.It's a guilty pleasure and a fun ride, zipping by in an hour and a half and also features a hilarious cameo by Peter Graves (Airplane).  Check it out! UK, as it is how much of the States is perceived over here.Also, Amanda in this movie, is also played by the same girl who played the Girl Scout in the first movie.Add a little bit of romance between Wednesday and another kid at the camp and you have something for everyone in this wonderfully funny and worryingly endearing movie.

You So Crazy (1994)	is essentially perfect in this. Clearly there was some conscious thought in this, and some professional writers. But it all revolves around intuitive timing.I dare you to watch the two comics one after another. One is demeaning, the other intelligent and enobling.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life. he goes all out and is totally RAW and UNCENSORED (as you can tell because of the NC-17 rating).  If you're chillin with a bunch of friends and you're looking to laugh your ass off, then this one will definitely do it for you. Check it out, but don't expect Blockbuster or Hollywood video to carry this 'bad boy'. man should hide when the police are looking for him.With that said, the second half of the film is where it pretty much starts to stumble. The laughs really do dry up and I think the concert film really drags on to the point where it gets really boring. The film probably would have been better as a hour special. by storm. Martin is one of the only comedians that really makes me laugh. He's funny in shows and stand up. The way he brings humor to racism is just super funny, especially when he imitates stereotypes of different races including his own. There was not a boring moment during this stand up and I laughed all the way through. all know Martin Lawrence for movies like NOTHING TO LOSE,BLUE STREAK,WILD HOGS,etc.In 1994 he conducted this hilarious stand-up comedy in the way that came as a shock to everyone, I mean almost everybody liked it.In this program he makes fun of White people and talks a lot about Racism,Relationship between girlfriends and boyfriends,the destructive influence of drugs and so on. 	6.7	0

The soundtrack rocks and the laughs come so often (very dumb laughs) that it's impossible to keep count.  Enjoy. heard when it came out that it bombed. I don't see how (What do critics know?). If you're one of those people who take their comedies too seriously, go read Dickens. But if you want to see a funny movie, rent this. Everyone in this is good. The plot is good. The acting is good. It's just a good movie. much!I don't think that anybody that ever was in a Rock-Roll band could watch this movie without cracking up. I guess maybe you had to be there?

This is a classic Rock-n-Roll comedy that you must see. bitch, and so works so well as that. The jokes keep going thru-out, and are actually funny, even after repeated viewings.

Air Up There, The (1994)	"note in the whole story was the misuse of the quotes from Quran which really had no point or place or meaning in the story. It just perplexed me. It sticks out with a pointlessness in an otherwise heart warming story. The ""Bismillah"" was beautiful but out of another time and culture and milieu, and still leaves me wondering (?) (technically) a sports drama, it really lends something to the whole affair that can put you in a good mood every time you watch it. I'm sure part of this is Maina's performance, which is so sweet you can't help but like it -- this is coming from a usually-cynical moviegoer who dislikes ""sappy"" movies.All in all, it's a charmer. wants to bring back to America.Both Mr. Bacon and Charles Gitonga Maina, who plays Saleh, have an easy time together bonding in a hostile environment. Their inter action makes the film enjoyable. Also, the mostly unknown supporting cast compliment the movie.Granted, this is a film to watch only for entertainment and to enjoy Kevin Bacon at his most charming self. back in the States. The adventures of the trip pretty much are the story.One negative: another irreverent slam to get a few cheap laughs at the Catholic church. A nun in here uses profanity and gives Bacon a big kiss on the lips. It's one more example of trying to make clerical people appear worldly like the rest of us. successive watching, as I continue to find noteworthy facets every time).In summation, I implore you to do yourself a favor: the next time you're feeling depressed, inadequate, or entirely stressed, rent or buy this movie, and watch it.

Another Stakeout (1993)	"comments about the filming having been done on an island in Puget Sound. A lot was shot in Seattle, but the majority was on Bowen Island - I should know - I was living there at the time. Just thought I'd set the record straight. (You can see the homes used for filming clearly on Google Earth, if you're interested.) I've seen a storyline like this in a story about cops. So that was very refreshing for me. Richard Dreyfuss and Emelio Estevez... A duo that you wouldn't expect to see on film... But wow... Total chemistry!! Line after line was just gold for me. I highly recommend this movie. I've told all my friends about it and they agree. violence, language, nudity, and humor. I'm not saying a movie has to be R to be funny. But if you've got a sequel to an R-rated movie like ""Stakeout"" and you decide to turn its sequel into a cutesy-tutesy children's entertainment program, you'd better advise the audience before they sit down expecting something funny and fresh.What a disappointment.2/5 stars.John Ulmer his gun has been replaced by a dead fish. This is not a serious movie. It's a fun one.In the first movie, Badham's taut direction and thrilling action sequences took center stage.

Bad Girls (1994)	"like Barrymore's bosom.It is not what I would call a smart film, however it does present itself as an interesting fable about the empowerment of women by women who remain women. I would liken Bad Girls to that of the Freudian dreams of those who struggle against ""the man."" I feel that it deserves to be seen at least once. and gave rise to Girl Power credence.  I couldn't take my eyes off Barrymore who had come a long since E.T. and her drug/alcohol fuelled periods of teen angst/pain.  The fight at the end in the corral blew me away, those  girls proved they could outshoot anything on two legs!!!There should be a sequel!!!4 out of 5 this movie that transcends the gender of it's hero. Make no mistake about it this is Stowe's movie to win or lose and she comes away having broke the bank at Monte Carlo. See it with open eyes if you like westerns. If you don't see something else as this will surely disappoint. It is a western all the way. The story line may not be totally accurate from a historical standpoint but the action and acting are good and more than make up for whatever may be wrong. For me the story was more about the relationship that existed between the four girls without going over the line and making it sexual. For me, Bad Girls was a winner. is a story of the depth of friendship, strength, starting over, finding love and fighting back. Who said women can't kick some butt. A real feel good movie that is great to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I would recommend adding this movie to one's movie collection. This is one movie where women are the heroes of the movie.

Still, it's hard to argue with an ending that has Montserrat bite into an authentic American hamburger and pronounce it ""incredible."" At least unless you're a vegetarian, in which case Fred would probably say that's your problem.] a relatively minor supporting role.The film is effectively a celebration of Barcelona and also of the situations that arise when different cultures meet. This might make it hard for some Americans to warm to but, ironically, that merely underlines the movie's main theme - that the world is bigger than the American continent and infinitely wider in its cultural scope. chosen professions. This doesn't sound like much, but it's really a hoot. The movie's core is the pair's verbal jousting, both with one another, and with the Spanish women they try to woo. It has a couple of sub-plots to keep things interesting, and just bubbles along. I recommend this highly, especially as a movie to see with a date. and fireworks at night. There is much charming, often subtle, humor in the film. Who could resist Taylor Nichols dancing alone in his dining room while reading the Bible? Or Chris Eigeman using a felt tip pen to change anti-American graffiti from ""American pigs"" to ""American deer""? Sure, the film is talky, but it doesn't take itself too too seriously. there are about 5 female characters who are easy to confuse. Do see it- you'll enjoy it.

Beverly Hillbillies, The (1993)	"Jed Clampett protects and cares for not only his daughter, but his nephew and mother-in-law, the latter two a constant challenge to Jed's patience, which he never loses. If there were more Jed Clampetts in this world, then maybe we'd all be living in shacks, but at least we'd be getting along with each other and treating each other better. blatant materialism. Every viewer realizes that, despite all the absurdity and the utterly ridiculous scenarios, the Clampetts know exactly what's important in life and that this family of uprooted hillbillies has a real life lesson to teach us all.If only there were more TV shows like it today! Alas, our society has become far too sophisticated for its own good. each other (and off the Clampetts) were side-splitting. Drysdale and Hathaway were a major factor in the show's success. I agree with someone else who commented that Irene Ryan should be up there in the same class with Lucille Ball. It's tragic that her name is all but forgotten today. But Granny lives on in the hearts of her fans. up her doctoring bag and charge full steam ahead to cure whoever might be ailing. From childhood to this day, I never seem to tire from watching this show. I can't say that about many others. Perhaps the Western series, ""Bonanza"", is one other that comes to mind. In both shows the characters own personalities forge their way into immortality. world. Again, they're simply being themselves. Maybe it helped that Irene Ryan was from Texas, Donna Douglas was from Louisiana, and Buddy Ebsen was from rural Illinois. I guess Max Baer was just a natural as Jethro, and he later dwelt on mainly Southern themes in his post-Jethro life as a film producer. PC or not, the show is funny!! "	7.2	0
Beverly Hills Cop III (1994)	"may be fair comments, but the film is still better than given credit for.Maybe not as funny as the first two, and maybe Murphy is more toned down, but there is still plenty of fun here from Bronson Pichot and others... not to mention an overall decent script. Even just trying to identify the director cameos is a fun game. Rick Avery, John Singleton,Ray Harryhausen, George Schaeffer, Joe Dante, among them. Catching music with again the international hit smash by Harol Faltermeyer.Glimmer and colorful cinematography by Marc Alhberg.The motion picture is regularly directed by John Landis because it contains some flaws and gaps. The picture will appeal to unstopped action buffs and Eddie Murphy fans. Rating : Average though amusing. and Tim Carhart was great as Eddie Willows on CSI. Seemed very forced at times, and definitely lacked the Foley-Rosewood-Taggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as ""Serge"" was painful to watch.5 out of 10, based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else. for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still, it's a very good series. such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin or Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan. "	5.5	0

It will not go down in the Hollywood hall of fame, nor will it be recollected by high and mighty of movie making.

Their are several bits in the film that will amuse even young children and even my son who is not yet two enjoys watching Black Beauty running with his friends Ginger and Merry-legs.The bottom line is if you love animals at all, especially horses, then you will completely adore this film. Anna Sewell's wonderful book, and the beautiful scenery and music enhance the story of Black Beauty's adventures with his friends.

Blown Away (1994)	"is good but never truly called on to do anything special. Amis, Whitaker and the rest of the support are perhaps a little under-used but the film is never about them. This is about Jones and Bridges in a deadly, vengeful face-off and the final showdown is everything you could ever want from an action thriller. Watch it and enjoy. slight lead to Blown Away however, for better acting and storyline. Another comparison would be Arlington Road, same type of story and Jeff Bridges. Explosions in this movie look real and are real, not computer animated. They look so real you can almost feel the heat on your face :) A definite must see if you like Action-Thriller genre movies I suspect this well done sequence is what is making many people call this film ""slow.""Finally, the use of ""The Joshua Tree"" by U2 was a really nice touch. Overall, this film is not outstanding, but if you want a movie that is relatively light, but has some comedy, drama, suspense and action all mixed in, then check it out. a contrived story in spots, particularly at the end when the fight between Bridges and Jones goes on forever as does the scene with Jones trying to save his wife. It's just too much. A lot of modern-day action films just don't know when to quit, and this is a prime example. Yet, it's definitely worth at least one look. On the MGM DVD the picture is a clear anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen with super good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, thus packing a punch for you home theater system.Overall, solid entertainment, you're not looking for anything like To Kill A Mockingbird, now are you?

Blue Chips (1994)	O'Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt Nover do surprisingly well with the material.  They are all three-dimensional characters and shine throughout the film.  However with that said, it is Nick Nolte who is the primary factor that makes the film well worth while.  Far from perfect, but still a very good movie.  4 out of 5 stars. and always has in much of college sports. I don't care for sports! But I loved this film. The ratings this film gets on here really ticks me off, what is it, a 5.5 star average? I've learned one thing on here and other review sites, if you let others judge for you, you'll miss a lot of good movies. McDonnell, Walsh, Woodard and the real players of Shaq and Penny do OK.  The cast is also filled out with plenty of coaches, commentators and such from real life  so there's plenty to see.Overall this is one of my favourite basketball movies simply because it tells it like it is  even if it does have it's weaknesses. sports fan would enjoy watching this movie. As a University of Kentucky basketball fan, I enjoyed seeing Bobby Knight get a little mad!!! Pete Bell was a man with a lot on his mind and finally realized that his career had gone far away from what basketball and sports should be...having fun! I really wish this DVD would be released!!! the role. This entire film tries to hard, accentuating points too harshly, and showing how corrupt the entire system in a manner that doesn't appear believable. I will say this, Nick Nolte really embodies the uber-Bobby Knight character, and what happened to Matt Nover? He was clearly the only good actor amongst all of the basketball players in the film. 	6.1	0

And Boothe does very well as the rat.But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky the main story is their troubled relationship, and how through good, bad and worse they get through it with each other's support.  Jessica Lange's performance as an unstable woman was amazing, not over the top in which it would have been typically done, but was portrayed truely and its fine nuance conveyed the subtle change in her mental state. that. Its inability to get released is a bit of a mystery though.  I mean a film with Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones should have no trouble being released in my mind.  Anyhow, this is Jessica Lange's greatest role.  Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe also give great supporting turns.  4 out of 5 stars. the plot is a little implausible- just like David sent off Bathsheba's husband to certain death- to seduce her- the army didn't reckon with the power of a strong and slightly crazy woman.  The teenagers in the film add to its poignancy.  On the surface the Marshall family seems dysfunctional- but actually- with love they function very well. for her performance. She deserved every win in a movie that was a testament to love. No matter how crazy, Major Marshall (Jones) was there for her because of his love.

Body Snatchers (1993)	"the teacher seems to want to punish him for being different). This is a spine-chilling, absolutely terrific little picture - but even if it wasn't, it would still be worth seeing just for Meg Tilly's exceptional performance - her ""where are you gonna go?"" monologue is as scary as anything in say, ""Psycho"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"".    (***1/2) watched and not compared.  In it's own right it is a good horror with only a few weaknesses that spoil it slightly.  And if you do want to compare it to the 50's version then please remember than this is the type of ending that Siegel wanted and to me is one of the strengths of this film. ever since his outstanding performance in Full Metal Jacket but what the heck. He's brilliant every single time. In conclusion, Body Snatchers contains a few very bloody and explicit sequences so horror fans won't be disappointed completely. It could have been a lot better, that's a fact. But on the other hand..it could have been a lot worse as well. concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people .

Boxing Helena (1993)	"is no resolution of the problem. Once you've gotten the basics though, it's fascinating to see how elegantly and delicately this psycho-deviation is treated. Nothing is superfluous, and everything fits. Even the ""dream"", which is part fantasy, part reality, part prophecy. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is very well done. See it again with the correct perspective. sick and obsessive male fantasy, make you almost believe it is OK, and then at the end you look at what you have accepted and realise it for what it is.Boxing Helena is not comfortable watching, but I think a brilliant and involved portrayal of how people(men generally) justify and accept the most controlling acts and confuse them with love. the extreme reaches of human eroticism. Suspense driven it takes the rider thru dreams and reality never quite allowing you to tell which is which until the very end. If you only enjoy movies with well defined good and evil you might find this an uncomfortable journey but for the adventurous soul rest assured, it is a journey worth taking. with original star Kim Basinger got in director Jennifer Lynch's way. In any event, Lynch hasn't been given the chance to purge this demon from her resume...one look at it and you'll know why. It's a curious mix of sex, fantasy and horror, but so perplexing and muddled, the provocative angle of the whole scenario gets lost. *1/2 from **** feel toward relations in today's society.  The depth of feeling, as well as the ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes really are great.  Maybe ""being male"" I am already emotionally retarded, so the absorption time for the movie's really great statements were meant to be.  Either way, this movie is definitely worth every thinking person's time. "	4.6	0
Bronx Tale, A (1993)	"to pick it up!  This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.  A film like this really deserves more recognition.And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of ""thank yous"" to your buddy Scorcese.  He's taught you well.My score:  A perfect 10! (out of 10)  De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn't want to repeat anything, so he viewed Scorsese's mobster trilogy to see what already had been done. It's obvious he paid attention.Even De Niro himself knows a little Italy gangster film is not complete with at least a surprise-ending cameo from you know who... smart as they come, but even with all that can't anticipate all contingencies.Lillo Brancato who went on to several other film roles and a long running one in The Sopranos certainly in real life didn't make the same choices as his character Calogero Anello did. Life really imitated art in his life story.Nice to see the Bronx get its due. scene) there isn't anything graphic (certainly not on the scale of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan!) and no nudity, just a good story. One of the gems is that nothing is sadder than wasted talent. Thank God that Mr. Palmenteri didn't waste his and shared this wonderful story with all of us. Unforgettable movie, a definite 10 out of 10! Niro's first directing job.  Directing is hard work, acting is hard work, to act in your first directing effort is...incredible. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Look at the kind of actor he is.  Great film, don't miss it, but please don't wait for the special effects. This is one film that doesn't need them to captivate you. 10/10 "	7.8	1
Cabin Boy (1994)	"punch him in the face, and gently rock him to sleep in a comfy blanket. This comedy is probably not for everyone, but the payoff for those who understand its naive, cynical hilarity is worth the rental fee. Hell, you can buy it for under six bucks almost any where. It is truly a misunderstood work of pure cinematic bliss. often lament ChrisElliott's underrated genius and dream of the day when Cabin Boy takes itsrightful place in film history as a classic. Hard to believe its already been ten years since its release and I still crack up every time I watch it. Only thing that could top it would be a sequel -- Passion of the Cabin Boy, perhaps? this movie a lot because of scenes that are actually in Get A Life, Chris Elliot's TV show. And that's not really fair. But that episode where Martin Mull comes over and they go to that brothel while they play ""Afternoon Delight?"" That was so funny that it kind of bleeds over into Cabin Boy and makes that funny too. for what it was it was really funny, with a lot of laugh out loud gut busting moments. David Letterman's ""wanna buy a monkey?"" cameo is fantastic and Chris Elliott is great as the full of himself, super annoying rich kid turned cabin boy. I really recommend it if you like any of his other work or Get A Life. and I laughed the whole way through. Summary: Unfortunately, people can't make a movie that trashes your run of the mill critic, and still hope for a good review. If you are a critic know it all, you'll hate ""Cabin Boy"". If you have an actual sense of humor you'll love it.Happiness guaranteed: That's what cabin boy is to me. "	5.2	0

Jerry O'Connel plays again as the poor little fool dominated by his friends (do you remember ""Stand by me""?) & the other guy, Gabriel Olds (sorry but, who is he?

(No not all of his films are good, but he's good in all of them).  It's a movie you don't think you'll want to watch and 15 minutes in, you want to watch the whole thing.  Enjoyable, very quotable, and about what every man dreams of-meeting Marilyn Monroe. "	5.0	0

Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made.

And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.Anyways, i give this movie 10/10 performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life (I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady, but as i said, this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves). All in all, Is a great movie, and personally, one of my all time favorites (if not favorite). Great Performances, Perfect Film. must endure when trying to escape his violent past.  Stephen Burum's nearly flawless camerawork and DePalma's flamboyant and operatic direction are a visual splendor that complements the emotional story.  This film is a highly underrated work of art that needs to be appreciated.  Great supporting performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller should not go unmentioned. Pacino's on screen presence and experienced acting mannerisms. Penn, once again is brilliant and shines through as the high-classed, cocaine addicted Kleinfeld.

Jon Lovitz is awesome!It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :. his clueless buddies Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz and the unnecessary profanity by Jack Palance.All the characters, however, are definitely fun to watch and there is a good message in the end about sacrificing for friends and relatives. The story also features a very neat twist at the end. This is a film you can laugh at with multiple viewings. of dollars in gold? I won't say what went wrong in their quest, but they did get to be really, really happy at one point, and that was satisfying.The real gold here was Duke's telling of his life story, and the guys working together despite incredible odds.  This was probably as good as the first movie for those reasons. Oscar magic isn't there and I couldn't help feel he took away from his original role somewhat.Overall this is amusing at best but really pales against the original (which wasn't a classic itself).  The action isn't up to much and the comedy only delivers a few laughs, preferring instead to retread as many of the original's jokes as possible. avid moviegoer I had to sit thru this crap and expected to be as entertained like I was with the original film(which was a gem). All I can say is that the movie studio heads saw the $$$$$ the original made and thinking that another one would profit just as much,regardless if the script was good at all or not. "	5.5	0

A guy who loses his memory every night allows for some great comedic possibilities and the movie delivers. Dana Carvey is such a funny actor. I'd love to see him get more starring opportunities. Also great in this movie is the dog. This is a fantastic comedy. Anyone should enjoy it and laugh a lot. much? This movie is definitely worth watching. might have been casting. Carvey looks like anything but a hard-boiled detective. Also, although I did laugh at some things, we have a modern-day comedy more needless sexual innuendos, sado-masochism offered and the like. Why? If you have a good comedian and a good story, you don't need that garbage. I think most Carvey fans were disappointed with this film. guy. He does not seem like the Hollywood type. I think he is highly underrated and I hope he can find his niche again. Clean Slate is the comedy version of Memento, or Memento is the serious version of Clean Slate. I heard that Adam Sandler was producing a script Dan Carvey wrote, so I hope something comes of that. 	5.7	0

It is die hard movie in the mountains.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. It is way to underrated and it is my personal favorite Stallone action movie. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. **** the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money... With breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, ""Cliffhanger"" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie... the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10 "	6.4	0
Coneheads (1993)	"card and whole new identity. There is so much to take in here and a lot of talented comedians are seen to good advantage, whether in starring or cameo roles. CONEHEADS is one of the most underrated comedies of the 90's which I don't think ever got the credit it deserved. If you've never seen it, definitely worth the rental. expect to see more of her in the future. On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised. players throughout the movie and they are pretty well integrated (i.e., they usually don't seem like tacked on cameos but fit within the plot). Also, although I generally hate David Spade, his annoying personality fits in perfectly with the character he plays.This is a good film for the whole family. It's cute, funny and actually has amazingly good family values! head over heels in love with Ronnie (Farley) a local mechanic and neighborhood boy who admits to never have dated a girl taller than him before. Coneheads is a great family comedy with tons of laughs from start to finish , Chris Farley 29, & Michelle Burke 23, play the star crossed teenage couple with humor and warmth 8/10 Stars I love the creativity of the story line. From screaming at the bowling pins and eggplants to rigging the pop machine to get ""silver tender disks"" to pay for the motel room.

Color of Night (1994)	`you Daffodils!' to see him naked here! And Jane March is stunning, also naked. Beautiful sex-scenes and nicely edited. The film has a nice chase too, a Mercedes SL against a Camaro or Trans Am.Advice: see this film and judge for yourself! (and write it down here!) Switch your senses off and just let yourself be entertained. You'll see, you'll like it! any and all credibility it may have initially contained, and Rush took it from there, taking `Color of Night' straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise.  It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one; once the magic is lost, it's hard to retrieve. 2/10. fun to re-watch. you do take yourself that seriously, get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20% that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime (that's just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher), don't take yourself so seriously.

Cops and Robbersons (1994)	"and Dad can't get a bagel without cream cheese on it. The cops are standard film cops except that Jack Palance is even more overpowering than usual.

Lampoon (Animal House) but it does follow in the same vein as the ""Vacation"" movies though. Chevy and Dianne made a great couple and have a great sense of timing that is so important to a good comedy. Chevy's character similar to ""Vacation"" develops from an disrespected head of the house to a respected Father. Don't pass this one by. film you get, In the good way. It's charming, with hitchcockian mystery music, it's well played, an it's funny without full of foul language, being harassing or embarrassing the wrong way, like many comedies do now.This is plain funny, with stupid persons, which is all quite lovable. In style of ""Dumb and dumber"" I recommend this for the whole family. as ever. For that matter, I really don't see how somebody that likes the Vacation movies could dislike this film. It's pretty much the same family, only they don't go on vacation. They have some cops come live with them and comedy ensues.Anybody who gives this movie less than a 6/10 needs to pull the stick out of their rectum. Slickers and Chevy Chase plays stupid extremely well because for one thing, he's become so used to it in real life. This is definitely the last thing he ever did that's worth watching. Robert Davi is also perfect in the bad guy next-door role. It's a family friendly comedy that doesn't rely on profanity or toilet humor for a laugh. "	5.0	0

Oh My!If you like a movie where the ending is not black and white you'll enjoy Dangerous Game. doesn't know what he'll do with the film, or how to finish it, and this sort of abrupt ending leaves the actors as well as the film in the cold. But as a film about film-making, I've seen worse, and I might even like it more if I catch it late one night on cable (definitely *that* kind of movie). Okay, now I'm ranting, but isn't funny how men are especially really down with the NeoFeminist Bull about how it's actually empowering for women to exploit themselves.) Ferrara plays with the autobiographical nature of the subject matter. The plot centers on a film director who compartmentalizes his personal and professional life, until the secrets of his professional life overwhelm him. it is even better than Evita.  The way the movie is set up is also interesting, crossing between a the story, scenes from the film in the story, and a documentary about the film within the story.  Yet, the set up isn't confusing at all. I would consider it one of my favourite movies along with Madonna's best. 	5.7	0
Dave (1993)	"also has a great deal of drama which keeps the audience intrigued throughout.  Frank Langella does some of the best work of his career.  Sigourney Weaver, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin, and Ben Kingsley are all perfectly cast in supporting roles.  The screenplay is smart and the direction never loses its focus.  4.5 out of 5 stars. direction is nothing special but succeeds in telling the story with humour and sadness that very often the people who get the top job have so little knowledge of the people at the bottom to make any significant change in society.First rate, and far better than the IMDb rating suggests. Also watch out for a great end gag. Top drawer. He was superb.To those who may say that ""Dave"" doesn't give a true reflection on American politics or make a political statement, I would agree with them, but then it surely didn't mean to. Its just a charming little comedy and/or love story that's easy on mind and eye, and for what its worth I thought it was great...so there! I realize that cynicism can easily get in the way of just enjoying a movie for what it is.Kevin Kline is terrific and so is the rest of the cast. Also, the insertion of so many real politicians and pundits playing themselves adds a nice touch. I thoroughly recommend this movie! I could give it no less than a 10. is what gave the movie a sense of realism. Finally, Reitman helps the audience fall for the plot. He makes it so believable, honest and true. In the end, the audience will realize that politics will not mend our nation, but rather honest people will. In any case of all the movies about the President, this is the best one. "	6.8	0

Richard Linklater gives a great independent direction. This isn't a film that encourages kids to do drugs, but it shows a true portrayal of teenagers in a America, in a very fun way.

The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment. the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.Two thumbs down. viable form beyond the book?

Fatal Instinct (1993)	"Assanti was a real serious actor and he wouldn't be funny but 5 minutes in to it when he put that hot dog in his jacket pocket I didn't stop laughing. Since then I've seen this movie so many time and I laugh just as hard as the first time. If you want a real good laugh get this one. Nelligan, Sean Young and Christopher McDonald add to the fun. To be frank, I enjoyed this more on the first viewing than I did on the second. After watching it twice, I thought the film would have been better had it been cut 10-15 minutes, and it's only 90 minutes. However, I am not knocking it: it's a fun movie. above similar efforts is the brilliant performance from Armand Assante, who displays a comic timing that I never would have guessed he had. He plays his completely oblivious-to-everything-that's-happening-around-him detective with such dead pan seriousness, that it's impossible not to laugh (the scenes with his skunk little Neddy are hilarious). Never mind the critics, find this film and see it. [8/10] character seems to love. Sherilyn Fenn is the loyal secretary Laura.

The personal conflict of each character is the heart of this exceptional movie... film, in its wide-screen splendor.  From what I understand, the shorter versions released internationally deleted and shortened some opera scenes for fear that they would be lost on Western audiences.  Having no prior experience with any Peking Opera, I found the scenes fascinating and integral to appreciating the entire story.  Spend the extra time if you can. mind, Dieyi seemed to be infatuated with Shitzou as soon as he got there. However you look at it, this is a film that has great performances all around. I especially loved Leslie Cheung as the adult Cheng Dieyi (requiem eternem Leslie, 1956-2003), not to mention Gong Li. An excellent film, but be forewarned: it's almost three hours long. 10/10 His real, enduring love is performing. It is the one constant that has seen him through.

However, it was reality. reputation as one of the most brilliant narrative and artistic directors of our time, along with other such contemporary auteurs as Kieslowski, Bertolucci and Kurosawa.You can not call yourself a film-buff if you haven't seen this movie.

Fearless (1993)	the Oscars.Director Peter Weir himself considers this his greatest work and was greatly stung by what he considered the slight it was given by Hollywood and the public.

It's a tear-jerker, and it's certainly haunted by the ghosts of the dead, but it's well-worth watching if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the best actors in the business at his best. and after that scene, we realize how amazing it is that he and the rest of them could have survived, and how fragile their life was in the face of overwhelming force.This story imagines a disaster and how useless it is to be afraid of a force more powerful than any individual (and that is the main character's profound insight). as Carla, a fellow crash survivor with whom Max forms an especially strong and significant bond. Written for the screen by Rafael Yglesias (adapted from his own novel), beautifully filmed by Allen Davian, and with a haunting score by Maurice Jarre that so sensitively enhances the drama in an understated way, `Fearless' is an example of filmmaking at it's best. viewed alone, with no distractions whatsoever. One of the more powerful sublime moments in the film for me is when Max is merely sitting next to his rental car in the desert, making mud from his own spit.  He sees it in a new way.

Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless, as he folds, spindles, and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. Does ""FoaBH"" resemble Spinal Tap? Yes, a bit. Is it derivative of Spinal Tap? No, not really. The aim is more focused, the satire is better focused, and to be honest, it's funnier. rap group N.W.H(N****z with hats).They are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedic film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene.Its a shame this film is not in the Top 250.Runtime:88min 10/10 of the most consistently funny movies I've ever seen. Cundieff, who did some hysterically funny segments for Michael Moore's TV Nation program, proves himself to be a solid director with an eye for biting satire. Unfortunately, some of the jokes are a little weak. That said, there are moments when this movie nails some of the hypocrisies of pop music (not just hip-hop). Pretty good performances all around, too. "	7.2	0
With Honors (1994)	"uptight pre-med student.The four Harvard kids learn a whole lot about life and what's really important in it. And I think they all will graduate life with honors.This review is respectfully dedicated to David T. Frank who checked out of life way too soon. Brendan, Joe, and the rest of the cast, this film deeply moved him, good job folks. Brendan Fraser, Josh Hamilton, and the spectacular Moira Kelly.  With a great performance by the priceless Gore Vidal - who's also in another of my favorite films, ""Bob Roberts.""There are also some nice shots of the Harvard University campus, and the film accurately re-creates the turmoil, joy, and passion and the hundred other emotions that come with college life. Fraser could kick ass and look hot but I was pleased to see him act. The guy´s good and his character was really captivating, which gets the movie going.There is a lesson coming from the movie, but it´s not one that will make you want roll your eyes (although it´s perfectly acceptable).I watched it twice, and I´d watch it again. you've got to choose how to live your life rather than just let it happen. It's a very ""carpe diem"" experience ;) It's also a perfect mix of comedy and drama, Patrick Dempsey and Joe Pesci kept the laughs coming. Not for the cynical or the bitter, enter it with an open heart and you can't help but be affected. caught this movie in the store and thought I'd give it a go because of Joe Pesci and Brendan Frasier. It's a very rewarding movie about life, and how sometimes we need to step back and see that we're all human. I'll definatly have to commend Brendan on his acting, a great job, and he's won new respect. Heartwarming film. "	6.7	0
Flesh and Bone (1993)	"is negligent, as a viewer, not to acknowledge it's quality. It is an excellent piece of film making and Dennis Quaid shows just what a brilliant and understated actor he is. James Caan, Meg Ryan, and Gwyneth Paltrow are also up to Quaids level here. I highly recommend this movie. It's different. It's interesting. It's engrossing. And it's brilliantly done. yet after this film ended, I knew I could not put it into words. The purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. Most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. This film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when I checked. the TV series Boston Public just to hear its opening theme music, which he composed) and a closing scene as mythic as that of any cowboy classic. The film's conclusion flirts a bit with improbability but still works because, dear friends, karma does exist. It's not just a hippie word. Leave the Anti-Megs to their own gravitational plunge and enjoy. that the viewer stays mesmerized as the story unfolds.  Caan, too, is a wonder as the bad-to-the-bone father.  As for the sweeping and lovely cinematography, it perfectly realizes the beauty and desolation that is west Texas. The final scenes are guaranteed to put a lump in anyone's throat, tears included.  Recommended highly for discriminating movie fans everywhere. the sugary sweetness that plagued the majority of her roles that followed. Scott Wilson also shines in a small but memorable role. ""Flesh and Bone"" may never receive the attention it deserves, which is a shame because it is unquestionably a lyrical masterpiece, beautifully shot and acted, recalling those low-key gems of the seventies like ""The Rain People"". Highly recommended. "	6.3	0
Widows' Peak (1994)	"they say, with a marvelous twist that caught me totally off guard. Wonderful performances by all especially Joan Plowright who kept me laughing whenever she was on screen. It was nice to see Mia Farrow successfully widening her range, and Natasha Richardson wafted through the film with an aire of mystery about her -as did Farrow- commanding out attention throughout. not since ""Hannah and Her Sisters""(not much then either). Natasha is a newcomer to Widow's Peak and not all are glad to see her. She seems to change the quiet little village into a media circus. I won't spoil it by telling you any more. You will have to watch and enjoy it for yourself. This is a must see! Plowright, who gives her usual impeccable and entertaining performance. The pace, the humour, and the plot are all perfectly executed, culminating in a climax that your best guess would not anticipate. Probably more a woman's movie, but then most of the best ones are. I have watched it numerous times and my enjoyment has not abated. Definitely worth the time. specifically from Natasha Richardson and Mia Farrow.  Others have described this as a ""more a woman's movie"" but I beg to differ.  This is a great movie for anyone and as a man I must say that Ms Richardson looked absolutely ravishing in the beautiful vintage costumes and makeup.  A must see for any man or woman. great chemistry between them. You care about the characters; even the annoying ones. One can tell that the actors enjoyed making this movie. I would recommend this film to just about anyone. If you are of the persuasion that normally avoids chick flicks or period pieces, give this one a try. You might be surprised at what you've been missing. "	6.8	0
For Love or Money (1993)	American sitcom stars to make a prolonged impact in the movies in roles unlike his character from Family Ties. Anwar also gives another performance which leaves me increasingly baffled as to why she has not been used more in Hollywood.See this movie, it may not have been a hit but it will surprise you with its quality just the same. the money. Hell, i'd wear a skirt and put out for that kind of scratch.The director Barry Sonnenfeld has an interesting resume of hits (Men in Black) and misses (Wild Wild West) and just entertaining films (Get Shorty). This one is entertaining fluff. It's an hour and a half of your time that you won't regret spending. 7/10 stars. G'night! character, Andy, his dreams ... literally. Everything seemed to come in together ... you really understood then how much it meant to him, and his sharing it with Andy was a wonderful gesture of his love for her. The moment was magical, the best in the whole movie for me. Watch this if you like a conventionally exceptional love story. who is keen to help but things get complicated when Doug discovers that his new found friend and financial helper is going out with the girl who he has been after for months (Anwar).The outcome of this movie is no surprise and the love/hate relationship and chemistry between Fox and Anwar is very entertaining.Overall an enjoyable film for all ages. Or Money.  The music, written by Bruce Broughton is just awesome, and it completely sets the perfect tone for the many different scenes.  I especially love the music when Fox's character is walking down the subway steps after leaving work.  This is a great movie to watch with someone you love.  I would definitely recommend it. 	6.1	0
Firm, The (1993)	"Some things may have gone a little too far, like the conveniently placed pillow truck, but as a whole, The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations, The Rainmaker, in particular, but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot, as well as good direction and acting, makes it way above average. supercharged climax. Not having read the book, I see where others are disappointed with the ending. Having no comparison to make, I can only say that it kept me absorbed until the final scene. Definitely a must-see if you enjoy action thrillers with a climactic punch. One of the best films of the '90s, full of suspenseful twists and turns. ""Basic Instinct"" as Abby McDeere, the ""cheated wife"", not only by her husband, but also by the firm he works for. Sydney Pollack showcases some of his best work as director, especially by the opening segment that describes Mitch McDeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes. Such a GREAT adaptation, and a even better film to watch! well done, but a thriller needs to hide some things, show some things, create ambiance and mystery, and so on, visually. It doesn't really happen.So, for a kind of technical high-stakes, rich person's good-guy bad-guy suspense film, it will get you through, but barely. By the last five minutes, if you aren't sucked in, you'll want to scream ""hurry up!"" way it's all brought off. Small wonder that Tom Cruise was chosen to star in the big screen adaptations of that television classic.When I watch The Firm, I'm reminded of that line from another television classic that one Hannibal Smith used to say about he loved it when a plan comes together. That's what you will like about The Firm. "	6.8	0
Free Willy (1993)	"to Simon Wincer for this great masterpiece. We need more movies like this, not a laughable rubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment. I rated Free Willy 10 out of 10 as an excellent and beautiful family friendly movie. Check out also its two sequels. They are also pretty good.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English. if it wasn't just natural in the specific sequences. His facial expressions and body language fit into the total frame as well. The story has some profoundly human themes to it. I can't help it, I think this one is both entertaining and deep, dealing with emotions and prospects of life, with integrity and courage in the face of danger. this out today and watched it again and it was still pretty magical to me, although I'm much older now. I don't see why this is rated a 5.2. I guess I wouldn't tell every adult to go out and watch it, but if you have kids, or just love animals, then give this a shot. It's a good film. will, for our entertainment.Now picture what I am describing to you isn't a whale.  Picture ""it"" as being human.I applaud Richard and Laura Donner for making this film and I certainly hope people can see this and change their thinking about things.  It is a powerful film.  And it is one that should be taken more seriously. have done. This film has taught us a lot about captivity and the need of freedom. There should be more films like this. If you are in need of a friend there will always be on in animals and this film has shown us so with Jesse and Willy. This film will continue to touch many hearts of the world. "	5.9	0
Fresh (1994)	look. The dreamy scenes where Fresh is seen looking toward Manhattan at different times of the day, is pure poetry. This is an important movie dealing with an important subject. Thanks to Mr. Yakin, we go into that world that, for some of us, might as well be in another continent, but never right here in another part of town! that kills off others. It moves at a healthy, but not crazy pace, and there are some truly chilling moments, which really make you ponder over humanity's capacity for mindless violence.This is certainly the best film I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, and I advise anyone who craves intelligent, thoughtful films to go out and buy this one. by Yakin (though the final scene is devastating):  we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist, we don't need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room.  That's a small quibble, though, because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate, and Jackson's early speech about the game is an ingenious device. impressed me so much.Overall, this film is great. It is boldly honest and originally beautiful (in repetition of myself) that needs to be re-released or remembered time after time. I am so glad that I discovered it and cannot wait to show it to friends and family. It is nothing short of the perfect film! Grade: ***** out of ***** which was playing everyone like they were live chess pieces. He got what he wanted all by playing one against the other. This movie proved that a film does not have to be high budget or big names to be great. If that were the case, The Last Action Hero or Reindeer Games should win an OSCARS for Best Movie. 	7.6	1
Fugitive, The (1993)	"and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, ""The Fugitive"" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993. Rating: Four stars. of the police. The result is an interesting cat-and-mouse game between him and the police that never allows your attention to fade away.The story is perhaps not exceptional, but thanks to the good directing and acting and the constant action and tension, this movie really delivers everything that you can expect from it. I give it an 8.5 - 9/10. back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate EVERYONE'S acting in this movie.And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an ""edgy"" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words. Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.There is magic, here! supporting actor in '93 than Kilmer in Tombstone, but Jones' work here was well deserving of his Oscar.The Fugitive belongs on every top 100 list and if the AFI wasn't so enthralled with older movies, they would see that films like this are more worthy than some of the mediocrity that graces their findings.  This is an incredible film. "	7.8	1
Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)	"deep eyes and charismatic presence or that of a soldier with his masterful horsemanship (performed by the actor himself), Jason Patric brings a special depth and beauty to Gatewood, making him one of the most impressive and under rated heroes ever captured on film. His presence alone makes this film a great classic, as well as a thought provoking treasure! of the ""Geronimo Campaign"" out there. Head and shoulders above much of the other junk out there about this important American figure. It is, to boot, beautifully filmed and deftly directed. And the narrative approach worked perfectly with this subject. Well worth a couple of viewing hours by anyone who sincerely wants to know what was up with all that.' plot faithfully depicts the historical progress of events and refuses to completely demonize the Whites (although they clearly are being portrayed as the expansionist aggressors)in order to build a protagonist-antagonist plot-structure. This makes the movie slow, and for non-buffs a tedious experience.Finally, the film has a terrific soundtrack by Ry Cooder and a knock-out performance by Wes Studi as Geronimo! never can win his war against white men. Especially this poetic and realistic movie is by comparison with other Indian sagas not a fairy tale from far west. Hill tells the truth and so we see only desperate people and no heroes - on both sides. Great - a must see for fans. I give 8 out of 10 stars. Good sound if you have the DVD and a surround sound system.Yes, this leans in the PC class with big-time leanings toward the Indian cause, but the Apache people apparently had a good case for their cause, at least with Geronimo's convincing question near the end of the movie: ""There is plenty of land. Why do you want it all?"" "	6.5	0
Getaway, The (1994)	Bassinger look like monks. This movie is not exactly Mary Poppins. There's almost too much of a mean edge to it....almost. Perhaps I enjoy ogling Bassinger too much to can this movie for its baseness.Whatever, this entertains to the degree that it makes it a very quick two hours. There is no way you could get bored watching this film. action scenes are top notch. Maybe I'm just a sucker for colorful characters and the bank heist angle is well done. Best of all is Alec Baldwin's character, Doc. Baldwin and the rest of the cast really deliver their lines with panache.Bank jobs, car chase, cat-and-mouse in a four story hotel, steamy sex, crazy characters.... what else do you want? that tops the original in several aspects. The acting is top notch by almost all the major characters. The action is fast paced and very violent. (I base this on the unrated HD-DVD).So if you have a few bucks lying around. Get this movie, I am pretty sure you can get it for under $10 in about every big store.. form here and very compelling to watch together. Besides the McCoys (and Richard Farnsworth), it is a B film. Michael Madson's hair is a real challenge to deal with. At least you can cut out of the Richard Marx end credit song. You have to live with Michael Madson's hair for the whole ride. IMDb rating should be around 7. even the supporting actors are very good: James Woods, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly and Richard Farnsworth. Alec and Kim are the Bonnie & Clyde of the nineties portraying very human criminals, their conflicts are so real in the story... after all it's one of the best films in the genre of the 90s! A must see for every action-thriller fan! 	5.7	0
Getting Even with Dad (1994)	"at places such as embarcadero bart station,chinatown,the aquarium,and golden gate park. with an unexpected problem: his ex-wife leaves their son (Culkin) with him once he hasn't looked after him for years. The boy wants some attention from his dad, so he hides the coins his father has stolen before he could use it. If the thief wants his coins back, he must give the boy some good time. My Rate 7/10 into ""Home Alone"" style antics as the young son brilliantly outsmarts his father time and time again. This all seems very familiar. Eventually the movie ends after nearly 2 1/2 hours of capers and disbelief. I wish they had of keeped the son out of it- police trying to 'get even' with the crooks sounds like a much better movie. to have been born without a personality. Yes, Danson is very watered down in this movie. To be honest, I don't blame him--this is the type of stuff that belongs on made-for-TV movies. You know your career has hit rock-bottom when you're in something like this.And just think, this was made somewhere around ten years ago.What a disaster.* / ***** used to blackmail the ponytailed Danson into pleasing the obnoxious Culkin. HOME ALONE(1990) and MY GIRL(1991)were at least worth watching. This is neither funny or interesting.  Danson fares well in his arrogant way. Gleene Headly is not believable  as a detective. Also in the cast are:Gailard Sartain, Saul Rubinek and Hector Elizondo. Geared for the grammar school set. "	4.7	0
Go Fish (1994)	"ad-libbed. I watched this movie (again and again) and thought THESE ARE DYKES!  This is NOT a Hollywood flick with shiny Hollywood glitz gals and high budget special effects. This film is RAW, and will appeal to lesbians and independent film lovers.  Warning: if you thought ""Bound"" was the quintessential lesbian flick, you will NOT like ""Go Fish"". movie in the summer of 1994, as a young lesbian who was just comming out of the closet who had never had a girlfriend.  I found the chemistry between Max and Ely so real, that I found myself yearning for that kind of relationship.  Daria's trail was also very well done, as many lesbians do share that attitude. (i.e. basic instinct and heavenly creatures) and that's what i like most about go fish because it's witty, romantic, and very close to the heart and although it's not the best film ever made, but who knows, a person who is a student in high school or in college might watch the movie during history/social studies class on lesbian history. the lead character, Max, actually is very good.  But the movie is so poorly constructed, and most of her friends are so one-note, that the novelty gets old pretty soon.  I was bored halfway through it; there is a clever twist near the end which raised it to a 5 for me, but don't expect much in between. just watched Preaching to the Perverted with her in the lead role last night which I also enjoyed immensley...she has a lot of talent and obviously chooses her roles selectively.It is an arty film which I think some people may watch with the wrong intentions...they will be disappointed but so what...they're not the people the writers intended the movie for.

Good Man in Africa, A (1994)	does in his role and this is not just because Friels is hard done by as the 'put-upon' embassy attache. The belly laughs expected of a good farce do not materialise although there is plenty to chuckle about and think on. However, for the chuckles alone the film is well worth seeing, now let us see how the book compares. to them for giving us Chaplin, Bob Hope, and so many others. But I digress. And this film is not on the level of Chaplin or Hope. I was disappointed. The biggest disappointment was watching great talents like Sean Connery, Diana Rigg and Lou Gossett sleepwalking through their roles on their way to a paycheck. They could have done better. looking female actors also help the film along although the  likes of Diana Rigg are under-used. Connery puts in a forgetful performance but both Friels and Lithgow are entertaining. The sticky atmosphere also comes through as does the general hurly burly life of a foreign diplomat in Africa..........I'll give it 6.5/10, easy going and good for a few laughs. much original humour and more than a few tributes to revered filmography - enough to keep me laughing, smiling and/or trying to remember what movie was being referred to, for most of the movie.  Comedy/satire may not be Beresford's best long suit, but I'll take this over just about any Hollywood comedy movie I've seen in quite some time. of humor regarding royal formalities, sexual clichés and even venereal diseases.But the main problem of the movie is perhaps its ending. The ending is quite abrupt and the scene thereafter is surprisingly mundane. In fact, I don't get the idea behind all that stuff. I haven't read the original novel but seems like now I want to check it out. 	5.0	0
Guilty as Sin (1993)	"Jenny does not find a way out afraid of losing her bar. Hard to believe that the justice system and her law firm could not find a way out of the situations created by her client. Don Johnson has great performance and the music score is also good. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Culpado Como o Pecado"" (""Guilty as Sin"") last-minute witness for the defense. I won't give away too much, but her motivation for doing what she does is totally inscrutable.Lastly, there's the gruesome climax. It plays ludicrously, though De Mornay is allowed one last, good moment. Her hysteria at the peak of her ordeal is touchingly real. Otherwise, the whole thing feels forced and phony.So does the movie. murder borders on ridiculous. The only redeeming factor about Don Johnson is that his character is so despicable, you have to hang around for the ending, simply to see him get what's due. Don't blink however because the end when it finally does come is both swift and a real stretch of reality. Watchable, but not much more. - MERK seemed that character - Don Johnson seems this character and it's a great and effortless performance and you should see it. (And if you weren't a fan of his television series, don't worry - neither was I - I never really paid attention to him - and wham, I'm now a fan!).This guy has gotten to be a superb actor. Johnson more, than in this, it's cool finale making you wanna jump up and clap. Despite the movie being a tad dry, with a kind of slow moving story, the latter really doesn't affect the film, thanks to bad guy Johnson and all the effectively tense and truly scary moments he delivers, in his performance, where sinning never looked better.

Hard Target (1993)	John Wick 1 and 2 my films, this is my film from the 90's and I love it so so so much. I love this film to death, I amazingly love it. Also Hard Target 2 doesn't exist for me. I never liked the sequel to the film skip the sequel and watch this one. Highly recommend to the fans. VHS cover in a video store. I didn't even know that movie exists. Hard Target is a 1993 action film that marked the US directorial debut of acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo, who brought out his Asian style of action to Western cinema.10/10 for me I love this movie to death, It is my number 1 favorite action film. what he does best: be an incredibly-nasty and brutal villain. An added bonus in here - a real hoot - is old man Wilfred Brimley as Van Damme's French uncle who comes to his nephew's aid.Add a great blues soundtrack and you have a great film to feed your male hormones with when needing to be fed some gratuitous violence. is like a preview of things to come...meaning Broken Arrow, Face/Off and the ongoing blockbuster Mission Impossible II! You'll really see how far Woo went from this debut.Definitely worth watching! Hard Target is not John Woo's best, but it's Van Damme's best film ever! This is where you see Van Damme in his greatest action, and thank Woo for that! in which he finally struck gold with Face/Off. Hard Target comes out a dark action thriller packed with a superb blend of martial arts shootouts and explosions. I recommend this to any 1 weather your an action junkie, die hard van damme fan or just a general film buff. Up there with Die Hard this is a true action classic 	6.1	0
Heaven & Earth (1993)	"for her actions, and her lack of relief from her revenge.  Ribisi is stunning as the outwardly simple, infatuated boy-like man with subtly revealed inner strength and cunning. Sometimes it is nice to take a break from the usual fare and take a ride on a work of art.  I loved this film and will watch it again. just magnificent to view. I also appreciated the director's ""sky cam"" with some wonderful aerial shots.The ""R"" rating comes from a very, very brief sex scene, which doesn't involve the major characters. There is almost no profanity in here. A strange film to label but it sure is a visual treat. I liked it even more on the second viewing are what this film revolves around: it is not a film for tourists or spectators. The excellent performances of Giovanni Ribisi and Cate Blanchett (apart and together) should only be missed if you are mainly looking for external adventure and action. Though it shares its part in weapons, scheme and drama, 'Heaven' is not blockbuster material: it is art material. of Krzysztof Kieslowski's work; as if, because the story is based on one of his ideas, the follow-through had to be some sort of homage. That strikes me as totally irrelevant. The idea came to other hands, who made a film according to their own lights. There's no need to compare what-might-have-beens. This is a beautiful, transcendent film. See it. of unearthly beauty, top-tier cinematography, *and* her talent that makes this a level above Streep, Dench, Bergman, Hepburn, and any other great at their absolute best.I suppose it's hard to imagine the existence of a full level beyond what we consider--previously--to have been the most beautiful and artful female performance on screen. But that level is here, and it's clear. "	7.1	0
Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993)	"necessary for the movie and that's why I still appreciate it.In the end this is an absurd comedy and parody on many kinds of movies. If you like this kind of humor and know most of the other movies, then you'll probably have a great time with it. I sure liked it and that's why I give it a 7/10. the same character as in Rambo 3, with many of his lines unchanged. If you've watched the Rambo-movies, (most important the third one), you'll get more of the gags and the dialogs, especially in the scenes from the Buddhist temple. Saddam Hussein is also excellent, he looks really like the real one! If you like stupid and crazy movies...WATCH THIS! and when the army wrote the sounds of the morse code (Dah di di dah dah di dah)! Couldn't stop laughing!!! The casting is great, with Lloyd Bridges as the President and Ryan Stiles as Rainbowitz, this is a great movie spoof! I recommend this movie for slapstick fans and people who just want a laugh, a lot of laughs!! like me, who enjoy these zany goof ball comedies. I really do prefer this kind of comedy to many I've seen today where it's more shock than originality. The Hot Shot movies are so much fun and I would recommend these movies for anyone. Just sit back and have fun with these comedies, I think you'll have a good time.7/10 ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie. "	6.6	0
Live Nude Girls (1995)	subsiquent succses of the above mentioned show its high time this brillantly acted,written and directed film got the attention it deserves.Career best performences are put in by most every actress in the film.Discussing the film in detail would rob the viewer of the suprises that help make the film such a treat.I strongly recommend the film to any and all. the viewer is an eavesdropper). Having just seen the newly released DVD version, it occurred to me how reminiscent the dialogue and style is to Sex in the City, which started its run several years after this movie. It is not a great and serious film work, but it is good, interesting, well-made, and may be a good conversation starter. relationships. (the pains! hahaha!) Basically leading the woman to herself and the fact that women always have one thing in common together which always brings them back together.A great female bonding movie, a great movie about diversity and also quite amusing as well!Highly recommended for women with a sense of humour who like to shmooze and bond with other women;P their suppressed unconventional longings. Gradual mutual acceptance and support leads to a sense of empowerment to experiment and take a chance of being themselves, insulated from traditional female fear of losing their reputation and becoming stigmatized. A new strength comes from their new bond in womanhood that gives them a new found freedom and courage to own their authentic sexuality. with a close-knit friendship which binds them together. The title can be somewhat misleading, although there is plenty of nudity involved, as this movie is more about women empowering women than about male exploitation/domination of women. A different slant in the old 'friends get back together for a reunion/wedding/death/whatever and talk/explore their past/renew bonds/whatever' genre. Worth a watch - 7/10. 	5.4	0
Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, The (1995)	"buds between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald. There also is some nice cinematography in here.Some might find it boring but I didn't. There was just something about this, a charm that made me feel good as I watched it and had me smiling even more by the end. This is a ""sleeper,"" a movie you might pass up..... but don't. about him as an actor but he is simply hilarious as Morgan.So what is this movie about? There isn't much of a plot so without giving anything away I'll just say that it's about a  sleepy Welsh village coming together for a noble cause. What's the cause and would you find it noble?Watch the movie and judge for yourself. underdone, the writing so sparkling, the plot so effervescently predictable in macro, but not in micro.  The film score is wonderful, too, using as it does actual Welsh melodies rearranged into big 'movie soundtrack' full orchestration.  And has there ever been a more beautiful cinematographic masterstroke than the torches on the mountain at sunset?  I think not! their names back then- very quaint yet logical to attach an occupation to their names! The photography was wonderful at showing off the unspoiled landscape- I really felt like I was a part of the events. This movie inspires me to want to visit the final resting place of Reverend Jones with a handful of earth from my own garden!  It adds to the mystery and beauty of the region and adds a unique feel to the film.Children may find it too slow and dull, but anyone with an appreciation for a good, heartwarming story will enjoy it.  I recommend it in particular to those with a love for the British Isles in general, or Wales in particular. "	6.6	0
House of the Spirits, The (1993)	"Chile and Argentina are not white. The whole cast represents EXACTLY what chileans look like and the difference between the higher and lower class. You can learn a lot from this film. This movie is 110% recommended. It may have some differences with the book but it is respectful to it. Excellent camera and direction work at a spectacular location. spreads are just incredible, I can't see anyone else in this character. However, I believe Wynona Rider and Antonio Banderas' love could be more developed, both are terrific actors and deserved to have more chances to show it so, but they surely didn't disappoint us when they are on screen. A very beautiful, melancholic movie, with performances you'll never forget. loved the people with the notable and chilly brilliant exception from Jeremy Irons (Can we ever really love his incredible characters?)Another underrated movie that seeks much and delivers well although at times with a bit too much telegraphing (the bathing scene with the young Blanca for example.)It was a three hankie movie in the end, A great three hankie movie.metro_alma@earthlink.net psychically touched wife like an angel-she is so  ethereal she seems of the spirit world. Glenn Close plays her  love-starved sister-in-law;she conveys her desperation so adeptly.  Meryl Streep treats her as a real sister and showers sisterly affection  on this poor creature.  It is a spellbinding tale and one that has relevance to all families. book evokes a much more magical, mythical, and ""Spirit""-ual feeling that reflects the special flavor of life in South America, especially with Clara having green hair, and more powers in the book. A lot of that feeling is left out of the movie.However, the movie mostly makes up for this lack in the extremely vivid presentation of the characters' emotions. "	6.9	0
House Party 3 (1994)	funny moments compared to the previous films and Immature, as well as Uncle Vester and the aunt, destroyed the whole film. There are a whole load of other issues I have with the film, but I don't want to give anything away.Do yourself a favour; don't watch it! And knowing this film is tripe, don't watch House Party 4 either! psychopathic side. This alone brings me and a fair few others close to tears.Add to this Showboat and the cast of ex-con catering and defy virtually anyone not to need picking up from the floor. Hysterics are guaranteed.Not big, not clever and certainly not in any top 100 lists, but a film that gets better each time I see it. as younger performers. They don't have that anymore. This would be more interesting historically if TLC are main characters. The story meanders. The comedy isn't funny. Tisha Campbell has only a few lines. The other actors are nothing interesting. The three kids are more annoying than fun. There's a party at the end but I don't care by that point. small budget films can continue to make money even after they loose their appeal. Take a look at Scary Movie 4 being released soon. Honestly, is it necessary? I do not suggest this film or this entire series. The first one, if you are forced to watch, than watch. Otherwise, don't waste your brain space! Grade: * out of ***** the first two films were great.  My advice is just stay with the first film. 	4.4	0

I'll Do Anything (1994)	"aforementioned movies, but they did a very good job. Also look out for the character played by Albert Brooks, which is very familiar with Jack Nicholson's character in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. It almost seems a trademark of James L. Brooks, who keeps delivering the goods with his original and always fresh romantic comedies. Don't miss this one! 8/10 depressed that I hope he doesn't kill himself cause I really like everything he's done, even The Hulk, and especially Affliction and that Martin Short with a kid movie. Joely Richardson is gorgeous! Julie Kavner and James Brooks are great. I highly recommend this film, and hope to see it again soon on DVD with all of the deleted scenes. as a down on his luck actor with a brat of daughter and trying to bond with her whilst dealing with machinations of the film industry.Where Brooks succeeded so well when he turned his eye on TV news with Broadcast News, the story here is not strong enough and although the actors try hard the film comes off as hollow. there, a group of ladies who work in casting  are asked, when deciding yay-or nay on this actor, if they would sleep with him.     But in the end, it stays true to its source, meaning it doesn't look completely down at Hollywood or anything else. It's just a really adorable feel-good movie.Did I mention adorable?-Sep it really was an ""in-house"" film, one that anyone who has been through what the various characters have could identify with, but perhaps not us out in the hinterlands (coming from Wyoming to Australia, I'm definitely hinterland!).  Kudos to actors and director for keeping this film together.  With lesser talent, it could have fallen flat on its face. "	5.6	0
In the Army Now (1994)	there were a lot of sexual innuendos, too many for a PG rating but not surprising in a modern-day comedy. That comedy overall is good with some laugh-out-loud scenes.Also, as with many films, the ending gets carried away. It was really dumb, but for most of this movie it was entertaining enough to certainly recommend if you need a laugh. I was watching them in the desert. I remember when our plane landed I just looked around and there was nothing only sand and thats what they see. This film understandebly never won any Oscars and I doubt if the American Film Institute will ever fight to preserve it, but it is still a nice way to waste two hours. all the basic service comedy situations going all the way back to Abbott&Costello in Buck Privates. Especially in the training sequences. Pauly Shore and Andy Dick probably grew up on Bud&Lou, but they do the routines with a Generation X twist.I liked the film and thanked God I was not in the situations that Pauly and the rest were in. troops by purifying water if needed.  The film is actually very funny and had me laughing consistently, Shore stays away from being too annoying.  Andy Dick is just as funny as he is on NewsRadio.  Petty and Grier are also funny.  I recommend this for Shore fans and those who want a good impression of him. funny guy and a great screen presence.In the Army Now is a super funny movie, mostly due to Pauly, but Andy Dick, Lori Petty and David Allen Grier are great also. It's difficult for me to put my finger on why I like this movie so much, but watching it makes me feel good, and that's all I care about. 	4.8	0
In the Line of Fire (1993)	"and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.  The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it! cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,""I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger"".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie. well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received anOscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and beon the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!! about killing.  Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him.  The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel.  Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn. heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, ""Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.""Well written and worth watching. "	7.2	0

The film as a film is very good  well acted, well paced, well directed and engaging from the early realistic shots of Belfast in the 1970's through to the 'I'm going out the front door' finale that is no less impacting for us knowing it is coming. someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.   I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.   The soundtrack is great without exception too!   A total and utter classic. powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes. have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound. "	8.1	1
Inkwell, The (1994)	several adults throughout the movie. What I liked most about this movie was the beautiful portrayal of blacks in love. The kids, and the parents. It was like watching an old home movie of my own family.Too bad Matty Rich disappeared after this film. I was kinda hoping it would turn into a trend. Blacks in positive roles in films. that the black audience didn't support the film. We keep crying for better images on film but when they come we don't support it. If you are an African-American you owe it to yourself and Matty Rich to see this film and hopefully some other ethnic groups will see it and understand that we're not all drug dealers and pimps. a teenager.  You also view the complex relationship between not only cultures but within the family as well.  You are pretty much leaving this film wanting more.  If one film really cries out for a sequel it's this one. MATTY, I'M BEGGING YOU, MAKE INKWELL 2 AND SHOW US WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE CHARACTERS YEARS LATER!!! talent with this heartfelt film. draw him out of his shell. The title refers to the part of the beach that is occupied by blacks, and it is a revelation to the shy kid who has never seen anything like it. Turman as the pompous, upwardly mobile brother-in-law steals the show, which constantly veers from drama to comedy. Worth a watch, although it is uneven. 	6.5	0
Jimmy Hollywood (1994)	"few people have seen it. It is brilliant, funny, sometimes sad and deep, but overall a story full of quotations. Joe Pesci is even greater than the usual, never mind the long blond hair. There is an astonishingly funny performance given by Christian Slater, to me his most impressive ever. Search for it everywhere you can and see for yourself. to identify with the likable Jimmy and his associates on the mean streets of the film capital.  The supporting cast is well-chosen, and the plotline progresses evenly to its satisfying final wrap.  If you liked ""Ed Wood"", ""Jimmy Hollywood"" could also be your ticket back to the movies as they were seldom seen by the rest of us. poster to this movie, I can only tell that the movie is as COOL as Pesci and Slater cool-looking while sunbathing at the pool. I just can't imagine, how such great movie could earn only $3,6 mlns!!! That's a shame for american audience. I recommend it for everyone who searches for some intelligent entertainment and for all Joe Pesci fans. with a good point (crime is bad and hope is good) and good acting should have made more money than any of the current Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar movies, but the movie world is not ruled by values and quality.  I give this movie a 9.5/10 I'd even think about making this movie a perfect ten. are not patient. They want everything in one big dose.  Jimmy is slow to deliver in that sense, the movie takes its time.  Those willing to wait, are very lucky. And those who are unwilling, miss a truly enjoyable experience.See it.  If you are perceptive and patient when it comes to movies. Otherwise, go see Titanic again. "	5.3	0
Judgment Night (1993)	for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end. of ***** very good scenes, one which involves them hiding in a train, having to bribe the hobos to keep quiet. A lot of action, some good acting, and constantly keeps moving. I give this movie a solid 6/10, because there were a few things that bothered me, but I won't go into this for the sake of not ruining the film. name Everlast,called Whitey Ford Sings the blues.anyway...everyone one i just mentioned did excellent work in this film.but for me,Emile Estevez and Peter Greene(Under Siege 2,The Usual Suspects,Permanent Midnight)were standouts.the movie itself is high octane excitement that doesn't let up until the end.it's a movie better watched late at night,with the lights off.for me,the verdict on Judgment Night is a 9/10 alternating between several different moods. His first score (electronic based) was rejected by Hopkins but that difficult decision proved be a good judgment (ha!) as the end result is one of the film's best features.Judgment Night is certainly an overlooked tour-de-force and is a brilliant action film with fine performances all round, but Leary completely and utterly steals the show. 	6.6	0
Jurassic Park (1993)	"the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film. lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made) fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film. "	8.1	1
Kalifornia (1993)	"Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real. enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence, an ending that was somewhat disappointing.Overall, however, ""Kalifornia"" is an entertaining film, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis. imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste (although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way). Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me (it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out). I reward this movie with an 8/10. a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. ""Kalifonia"" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore. be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This film is disturbing on more than one level. But then, it's meant to be. "	6.7	0
King of the Hill (1993)	"of some of my closest relatives. Spalding Gray and Elizabeth McGovern's characters deserve a full movie of their own. Lisa Eichhorn's tender fear of having to leave her children behind is just another of the ravishing notes of this stunning film. If you haven't seen it. Give yourself the pleasure. You are going to love every little bit of it. film that, as I have already said, is (in my opinion) the greatest American film of the nineties and should be seen by everyone who is a fan of not just intelligent cinema, but film lover's in general.  And it's about time the film got some kind of proper video and/or DVD release, as it's unavailability is scandalous. 10/10 not a new theme, any more than that of the capable child flourishing in adversity, Soderberg brings a timeless quality and a steady, gentle mood to this piece, making it more about the hearts of the people than the tragic times which are displayed. Jesse Bradford, as the central child, and Adrien Brody as his older friend, really shine. Nice. Oscar winner Adrien Brody in his first major role as Aaron's ""big brother"" role model, and Grammy winner Lauryn Hill in a nice bit part as a sympathetic gum-chewing elevator operator.Although historically little seen, this film has been universally lauded, and as the early masterwork of an Oscar winning director, it's a crime that there has been no DVD release. it's not very likely that you'll be able to find it at your local video store. Especially if all you have is the local communist Blockbuster near you. Anyway, King of the Hill should be regarded and known far more highly than what it is. It's a sin for a movie this great to not get its due. Grade: A+ "	7.6	1
Lassie (1994)	"cooped up in the big city with nothing but rock, hard and soft, music and endless music videos to watch and waste his life, and hearing, away with. But most of all if he didn't move out to the country he never would have got to know and become a life-long friend, like everyone else in the movie, with Lassie. movie which focuses on some young kids and of course, Lassie, is good for a night at home in your jammies. My parents were very happy when we picked this off the shelf at the video store.  While my sister and I were very happy that Lassie was so beautiful, and that we had fun watching this movie together. was also quite fortunate to be surrounded by other great actors such as Michelle Williams and Charlie Hofheimer.I really loved this story because it expressed the true values of family and unconditional love. I recommend this film to families, children, and adults alike. I still love this movie and probably always will. I give it a 9 out of 10. for most of the USA. The music is good, photography is excellent and rich is color, story extremely possible, locations were outstanding. Production gave a feeling that you were right there is the location and experiencing everything as it happened. My four year-old loved along with the rest of the family. It kept everybody attention. Overall an excellent family movie. a Labrador retriever can herd, the canine star of this movie can give birth to puppies. I'm sure that the problem was that the writer didn't want to say ""border COLLIE or Bearded COLLIE or Australian SHEPHERD, but why not ""Corgi,"" or ""Sheltie,"" or ""Tervuren?""

Don't whine to me about artistic merit, character development, internal meditations on life and all that crap-I have those movies on my list too. It's an action movie, where the bad guys are supposed to die, cars are meant to explode when scratched, the good guy is untouchable, and it knows it. 8 out of 10 at comedy or even a family film. It was just meant to be fun to watch. And that's what matters most in any film. There are things about the film that don't work, but there are things about THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE that don't work, either. All that really matters is, Are we entertained? On that note, LAST ACTION HERO delivers. it for what it's intended.This movie is on my top five of my favorite Arnold films, because of it's boldness, and the fact that Arnold can be really funny when he wants to be. It's on my top twenty favorite comedy movies, and it's also in my DVD collection.  Don't worry Arnold.  Your true fans love this movie. film it's certainly a good one with a very good concept.  The intentional continuity errors are funny and clever, the movie cliche's are great.  So what if it's a little cheesy and Arnold is the only decent actor?  Enjoy the conflict of reality and fiction, and see this movie because it's a fun and somewhat thoughtful flick. "	6.3	0

Fox fans or anyone just looking for a good laugh! have the cute, talented Christina Vidal Who for some reason we don't see anymore. She is perfectly poised in her scenes with Fox.

This movie is great and everybody in the family will enjoy this. in the early 90's- smoking and trying to quit.

Lightning Jack (1994)	there when he wrote it.A series of wonderfully scenes in bars all over the West, culminate in a perfect last heist that nobody knows about, and robs Hogan of his wanted fame.Unfortunately, the box-office showed less confidence in the movie than it's investors on the Aussie stock-market did, but do not let that deter you from a very funny movie. Jim Carrey's and spontaneous enough to steal the show without any lines. Lighting Jack wasn't able to read without his glasses , but how he tried to hide it from everyone.

Paul Hogan's stiff acting is an asset here, Cuba Gooding Jr steals the show hilariously, without saying a single word.

M. Butterfly (1993)	"is exceptional as one who is just as driven and hooked psychologically in his own way as what it is in him that drives him to fulfill Jeremy's ecstasy and descent into irretrievable madness. Definitely one of the best movies ever! I hope this makes it to DVD sometime soon as it surely deserves to be seen again and again. because David Cronenberg is undoubtedly the finest director to deal with the most important topic in the story: gender bending. ""M. Butterfly"" is the Canadian Cronenberg's first Hollywood funded debut. The surprise plot of the sorted true love story is one of espionage. An adults only film, it is one of intrigue, sizzling romance, twists & turns, deception & betrayal. as good, but still fine, and the supporting cast includes a nice turn from Brit veteran Ian Richardson ('Dark City'). Most Cronenberg fans will probably find this a bit difficult to get into, as the material isn't exactly typical of the director, but it's much better than its bad press makes out. I expected to hate it, and I didn't. believable. Directed by David Cronemberg, ""M Butterfly"" is probably one of his best films with an intriguing love story about clash of cultures, having China as background in a troubled revolutionary moment great acting and magnificent cinematography and set decoration. Even when watched more than once, ""M Butterfly"" is still an attractive gem. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""M Butterfly"" been searching for a copy of Damage also starring Jeremy Irons...haven't found that one either. Why are the most artistic films, the ones that really have something to say, the last to make it to the after-market release of the film?? I have noticed that Jeremy Irons tends to portray emotionally crippled characters...it certainly works for him in this film! "	6.8	0
Made in America (1993)	"on screen he is a joy, still in his ""Fresh Prince"" mode here he certainly doesn't disappoint. Nia Long is the real find here. If one person from this film should have been given a better shake than anyone it is her. She is vibrant, funny and worthy of the people she shares the screen with. That says a lot. it manages to more or less avoid cringes and concentrates on the laughs, only giving as much time to story as is necessary to keep everything moving on. Against the odds and thanks to the superb cast this is a good natured film. It harks back to the optimism of the early nineties, and seems strangely innocent, eleven years on. good gags in it, although the movie is not overstuffed with them. The decent, heartwarming plot (just the right amount of twists) handles the race aspects with an exemplary ease.Jennifer Tilly's bit-part was funnier and more successful than Will Smith's. Made in America is hardly a classic but is worth watching if you like a little maturity in your comedy. plenty of good humor in it.  The best part is the filming of the commercials.  Who would have thought that a shoot that goes horribly wrong would produce footage much better than what was intended?  Also, Nia Long is BEAUTIFUL.  Out of all the films I've seen, I think this one is a hair above average. he's also an obnoxious and pompous car salesman. Naturally, complications ensue when her mother makes it clear that she requested a black donor. Cast is talented and enthusiastic, setup is very clever and has the makings of a really enjoyable comedy, but unfortunately they're wasted on a sorry script that repeatedly resorts to dumb, sitcom-style humor. A real shame. ** "	5.0	0

Baldwin's ability to jump from utterly charming to incredibly chilling in the blink of an eye is on full display here; it is truly the performance of a lifetime.See it once for the suspense, and again for the acting. you will not be disappointed! The background musical score is one of the most memorable that I have heard in any movie. Malice is a tale of arrogance, power, mystery, and deception, that must be seen and will be long remembered after the final credits roll.This is a very fine film that does not get the credit that it deserves! and Baldwin roles respectively. Typically, the move from low-budget TV-movie to Hollywood blockbuster has brought the expected revisions and 'beefing up' of the script. Everything added was extraneous and served no real purpose.

Watch it, and I think you'll agree. not be achieved without a slow build, but still this movie is one of the best suspense movies out there.

And the murder mystery is very intelligent, fun and stylish mystery-comedy.

This is a comedy that actually has a story, and Woody has the best lines. If you don't like Woody's style though you won't like this, but if you have seen Annie Hall or any of his other movies and liked them then you should love this one.Zoopansick well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein.I loved it. 	7.4	0
Menace II Society (1993)	ignorance of his surroundings, instead choosing to head down a dead-end path. Violent, almost unbearable at times, but faultlessly acted by the cast, and filled with powerful, authentic scenes. Tate is an absolute powerhouse as Turner's younger, impulsive, and extremely cold-blooded pal. Obviously not for all tastes, but a monumental achievement regardless, thanks to a superior cast of actors. ***½ all the ghetto films made, in fact the film at times feels like we are on a documentary drive around downtown Watts. Menace II Society, however brutal it clearly is, has loaded the gun and shot the bullet, only to see it narrowly miss the whole target it was aiming for. Still it's one hell of an experience though. 8/10 an excellent film that you should see if you ever get the chance. It has a good message, and it has some very moving moments in it.

One of the small cast of that film is Wallace Shawm, star of  `My Dinner with Andre,' which has been mentioned her by another reviewer. As he says, `What Happened Was' is on similar territory to `Andre,' but it's much more somber and doesn't give that `redeeming' feeling at its end. Demanding and rewarding. 	7.0	0

Perhaps these were originally to be explored in a little more depth.I suppose this ""accountant's cut"" didn't do well enough at the box office for there to be much chance of a director's cut and that's a shame. It seems there is a much better film somewhere in here screaming to be let out.... and the frequent fades-away which, in my opinion, manifest a little hastiness by the director, I found the picture full of hope.

Then this is the equivalent of the Blues for the eyes and food for thought. Cheers Mr Leigh. simply a movie with teeth but one with rabid, venomous, acid-tipped fangs, tearing and gnashing at our pompous ideas about our own natures.There are many movies which are fantastically enjoyable and make for a sterling night out with friends and family. This is not one of them. Naked is disturbing, unpleasant, frightening and utterly bleak. It is also quite brilliant. his actions would be deemed illegal in real life - if you have seen the film.)What happens to the on-screen people the day after this film ends?

Round-Up.Mesmerizing and fast-paced, there is no shortage of excellence in the smaller plots and characters: Greg Cruttwell is spectacular as the pompous, nouveau-riche Jeremy, and the two female leads, Leslie Sharp and Katrin Cartlidge provide well balanced juxtaposition as two very different femmes damaged.Not for the faint of heart, Naked will test one's own philosophy, and leave you stripped bare. shows Mike Leigh as a master of his art, expressed by the unique performances he elicits from his cast.

During the course of all this, Tolkin gets plenty of jabs in about an American economy that seems to be teetering on wisps of hope rather than on any true productivity.

It's pretty interesting all the way through, it has some good, 80's style action, corny B-movie lines, a B-movie feel throughout the movie... so, if you can watch it for free, either borrow it from a friend, or watch it on TV... if not, only watch it if you're into movies like Fortress. 6/10 name... Plus the 'two faction-one nice, one evil' has overtones of Lord of the Flies. While both of the above comments are applicable, the film rises above itself. With good performances from powerful actors such as Ray Liotta and Stuart Wilson, along with a sharp script, 'No Escape' is a hidden gem, and well worth seeking out. Final Score: 7.5/10 who stars as the resident beer Maker.Unfortunately the film bombed on both sides of the Atlantic taking a measly $15m in the states and a pathetic £500,000 here in the UK on it's original release 10 years ago but don't let that put you off it's very well acted with plenty of action and Drama.My Rating:- **** out of ***** good job of playing a violent anti-hero. There are some great battle scenes and fun supporting performances.Overall there isn't really much else to say about ""No Escape"", apart from you will be entertained if you enjoy action films that you can't take too seriously. If I'm objective I can't score it very highly but for entertainment value it gets 4/5. you like action, B-movies with a touch of sci-fi and want something to eat popcorn to, give this one a try. You can pick it up pretty cheaply or even stream it from many a website.Plus, is it just me, or are all the computer terminals straight out of 'Aliens?'

Carousel.Paramount got it's number one star and biggest recording star in America at the time, Bing Crosby, to make a record of it. Bing's record sold well, but the big hit came from Peggy Lee. I'm surprised that Marlene didn't sing a full version in the film, it's just her kind of material.Could have definitely helped the film a lot. the censor decided to give them a break! One goof--at the beginning, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the American pronunciation. (The English say ""leftenant."") Since Milland was British, he must have been saying it that way because the American movie-makers feared that American audiences would be distracted and confused by the British style. is exceptional in that Marlene & Raymond present outstanding performances. The acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production, but the script, direction, and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars.

Rebecca (1940)	"sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too ""old fashioned"", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'Rebecca'! so well that it's strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock's films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her. Few other movies affect me so emotionally - one of them is Vertigo.All in all, this is a fantastic piece of film-making from Hollywood's golden age. Laurence Olivier is in top-form, as he plays the quiet, sad Maxim and George Sanders is positively hateful.10/10 - a visceral masterpiece Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel.  Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that.  Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces. untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be.

If you're a fan of escapist, thrilling adventures populated by superb characters (see George Sanders as ffolliot, and Robert Benchley as Stebbins) you will be delighted. This is one of Hitch's lesser seen gems and deserves to be rediscovered without delay to any of his films.  Particularly good are the memorable windmill scenes and the exciting climactic sequence in mid-ocean.

At this point ""Foreign Correspondent"" becomes an inventive chase thriller, darting across the audiences' eyes at a berserk chase.

I look forward to this film making it's DVD debut! cherubic and cheerful hit man you've ever seen! The final scene was strictly American propaganda, but that can probably be forgiven considering the subject matter of the film and the time of it's release.All in all, a wonderful example of the master at his best, that deserves to be dusted off and enjoyed alongside some of it's more celebrated cousins!

As in all great films, it is a spot-on rendering of its own unique story in the ambiance of its own time, but timeless in its portrayal of human character and emotion. Like a handful of others, it is as satisfying a movie experience now as it was 40 years ago...probably more so...whether on first viewing or 40th. scheming mother.NOTORIOUS is intense and meticulously crafted, and benefits from the best acting in any Hitchcock movie.  While NORTH BY NORTHWEST or THE 39 STEPS might be a better introduction to Hitchcock for people used to the slam-bang action of modern cinema, NOTORIOUS is the best I can recommend for those who have already learned to love Hitchcock's work. even more complicated figure. Screenwriter Ben Hecht and Hitchcock team up for some pretty intense moments in `Notorious', and compliment each others styles and talents wonderfully. There are not many nail-biting moments in `Notorious', but the script is excellent.  Coupled with the superior acting and direction, `Notorious' is certainly a Hitchcock film that should not be missed.  --Shelly her to do some of her own interpretation, particularly early on during the ""character-building"" scenes (before the plot moves all the characters into their appointed places on the chessboard).

It is also worth watching for the famous Salvador Dali dream sequence, which is very creatively done and fascinating to watch.  Peck and Bergman also create interesting and sympathetic characters, who make the viewer want to know what will happen to them.Overall, this is a distinctive film, and well worth seeing for any Hitchcock fan. to recover hisfull memory.7.It's a technically astounding movie,as in every Hitch movie:it features the shortest color scene (it's a black and white movie)in cinema.And I won't tell you when it appears,watch out.8.It's a movie from the Master of suspense,and I trade you ""a lapse of memory"",""shattered"" and ""the third day "" for ""Spellbound""!It deserves to be in the top 250! to clear the patient's name.Brilliant camera work and being filmed in black & white really helped the story line. There is an eye opening dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali that is down right mystic.The strong and talented cast also includes: Regis Toomey, Leo G. Carroll and Rhonda Fleming. This film is worth the time to watch again and again. need only compare this film with his very next one, NOTORIOUS, to be painfully aware how much better Hitchcock on his own -- using his own standards of pace, momentum and the ADULT treatment of script themes -- could be when not under the thumb of Selznick.

I give this movie a definite 10. is very slowly unraveled in layers until the peak of the scene, scored by the emotional title theme song. This scene ""gets"" one every time, that's how effective it is. Beautiful costumes, scenery, clever photography (note the scene where the open patio door reveals the Empire State Building in its reflection), great cast make this an enduring, never-forgotten golden classic. this film  around Valentine's Day (even if you are single) is always a treat. It  allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are  actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in  a thunderstorm.  Watch with a box of Kleenex nearby.  My rating: 4 stars demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie, or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species. and corny, but part of its allure is that it is not too realistic. It gives us an escape into the ideal world where everyone is good looking and charming.

Rating : Above average , this Hitchcock effort proved to be as successful as his former popular movies. same can be said for the chic Jessie Royce Landis, who always showed she was a smart and elegant actress.While this is a film so different from most of his other films, Mr. Hitchcock shows a great affinity for comedy in it. This proved to be a pause in his distinguished career to amuse his public. How well he succeeded! fantasia, the director's vacation from his more typical material. While it will never compete with the more famous VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW of the same period, it is extremely well done and quite a bit of fun to watch.

Father of the Bride (1950)	"amusing... Torn by jealousy, Tracy is all good-natured father exhausted by the complete weight of the problems leading up to the happy day...But it's an ensemble show, and as the typical spoiled daughter of a typical mid-American bourgeois, Elizabeth has one of her joyful screen moments, altering and urging her beloved ones with such gentle, persuasive, winning, and gracious manners... cast is excellent. Leo G. Carroll is good as the befuddled caterer, Melville Cooper does a funny bit as the church deacon and the still beautiful Billie Burke along with Moroni Olsen appear as the parents of the Groom.""Father of the Bride"" under the able direction of Vincente Minnelli, is the kind of family comedy that we rarely see anymore. poignancy, especially in the last few sequences where the parents dance together in the post-party mess of their once-pristine house.  This kind of thing puts the movie above the ordinary, and is exactly what was missing in the Steve Martin remake years later.And don't let me forget Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen as the groom's parents - really funny! from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other. here. I kind of like that. Daffy Duck did that, with hilarious results. So did Groucho Mark. It made us, the audience, feel we were involved with wedding, too.All in all, still a good film which holds up reasonably well if you can look at it as a farce, and a comment with weddings - something that will never change!

Band Wagon, The (1953)	"the pas-de-deux of ""Dancing In The Dark."" It's an exquisite sequence, which at times resembles courtship, foreplay, and ultimately a romantic climax- all done in dance. It ends, just as smoothly as it began, with the two leads spinning up a short flight of stairs and mounting a hansom cab, without a single hair out of place. Now THAT's entertainment. 'Girl Hunt' is so inventive and perfectly executed that you can't help thinking these two dancers really *do* match somehow.Simply put, you just couldn't go wrong with THE BAND WAGON. You'll laugh, you'll marvel, you'll sing along... but most of all, you'll be well-entertained. And if *that's* the point the film is trying to make... point surely very well-taken! 8/10 dance with the shoeshine boy, Le Roy Daniels; anything featuring Cyd Charisse - and those wonderful musical numbers, ranging from the anthem 'That's Entertainment' to the hilarious 'Triplets'.'The Band Wagon' sends up the old film staple plot ""putting on a show"" and does it brilliantly, thanks to the crackling Comden/Green script.  One of MGM's best musical efforts, hugely enjoyable. Charisse comes into her own.  Apart from being arguably the best female dancer in Hollywood history, she was certainly the most beautiful: the scene in the ballet in which she appears on a bar stool and slips off her coat to reveal a dramatic red dress oozes with as much sex appeal as any movie moment I've ever seen. and those marvelous songs that come one after another to delight eye and ear! And give Jack Buchanan a hand for squeezing every bit of ham from a role that calls for it, in spades!Almost forgot: the opening ""Shine on Your Shoes"" number set in Times Square is a howl! The only black seen anywhere is the shoeshine man himself. "	7.6	1
Ninotchka (1939)	and one that doesn't feel the need to beat us over the head with it. The relationship is well-developed, the characters interesting, and the execution top-notch. For me personally, the film lacks something that would render it a 10/10 classic, but that certainly isn't indicative of its quality as a romantic comedy. A great way to spend an evening. 8/10. satire are soft, more Noel Coward than propaganda.My lament is not seeing more comedy from Garbo. She made such serious and tragic films, when she could have been making us laugh. The film is dated, yes, but Garbo herself shines through along with her three Russian accomplices. I think that Billy Wilder and Garbo would have been a great team while they are thrown with accuracy, their sting is never such that the satire sinks into the mire of political ideology. NINOTCHKA, after all, is about the triumph of love over politics, and to those who feel trapped in the prevailing toilet-ethic of the Farrelly Brothers' blood-poisoning of modern comedy, represents a much-needed antidote. Inoculate yourself at your earliest opportunity. masterly, but not 'ground-breaking', a fault for which some are willing to run him under the harrow -- a case of holding someone to impossible standards. Nobody can break new ground in every film -- sometimes we have to settle for mere masterly competence. See this film! Unless you happen to romanticize the former Soviet Union, you will enjoy it. her laugh, and from that moment on, she's a delight. For an example of just how good a comedienne Garbo could be, watch Ninotchka's face as Douglas's character tells her corny joke after corny joke in an attempt to win a smile from her; or the scene set in a nightclub when Ninotchka discovers the capitalist wonders of champagne.Grade: A+ 	8.0	1
Love in the Afternoon (1957)	"one afloat. There are also some very good sequences in the screenplay, for all that it was uneven in general. The odd thing about ""Love in the Afternoon"" is that if you can tolerate the poor setup and get past the obvious flaws, you can really enjoy most of the movie, because it does have several positive things to offer. he had tremendous difficulty in shooting the picnic and row boat scenes. It seems as though the location was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and they were unmerciful to cast and crew. Wilder took several takes just to get enough usable footage.Audrey Hepburn fans will be mad for Love in the Afternoon, Gary Cooper's though might wince when seeing it. spunky in one of her best performances. The song ""Fascination"" is used to great effect. Filmed in 1957, the only way to show the title occurrence is to have a camera shot following Hepburn's dis-robed fur coat falling to the hotel room's floor, as she embraces Cooper. The ending is suspenseful, with cute narration epilogue by Chevalier. A wonderful film. of age; it's about chemistry and personality. Bogart in ""Sabrina"" offered the same problem, though less so. As an example of another pairing that worked well despite a sizable age difference, consider Stewart and Kelly in ""Rear Window"".Frankly, I'm surprised that such obviously poor pairings plague numerous films, but apparently some believe that box office draws can overcome such issues. I don't think he could have pulled off the 2nd and 3rd act, and Cooper did. When he's sad (dictaphone/wine cart/sauna scenes) he's a top form comic actor.  Anyways - I digress.No one can produce the feeling of heartache with so much sadness and glee as Wilder can. The gypsy band should have earned a best supporting actors nomination. "	7.3	0

This movie has often served as an introduction to Maurice Chevalier for movie watchers, and he illuminates the screen. If you want to see him in another of the greatest musicals, watch ""Love Me Tonight"" with Jeanette MacDonald.Thank heaven for this movie - it's a world that I would love to inhabit! I give it 10 out of 10. cannot tell you how many times I have heard that beautiful song in my head as he has discovered his Gigi is a ""woman"" now and not a child. My sister and I will forever keep this movie close to our hearts. I suggest anyone who is a romantic or loves musicals to go and rent this one right away!! any other personality performing these songs?Jourdan is perfect in his role and so is Gingold. Thank heaven!!! Lastly, I must pay homage to that city on the Seine. It is the ultimate star and should have gotten a special award.I agree with those readers that have called Gigi the best Hollywood musical; it is really the perfect musical. Thank heaven!!! as a typical MGM fluff piece, could be a hard sell, particularly to the jaded Generation Y - and - younger audience. However, since I myself am probably one of the most cynical film-viewers I personally know of, take my word for it  ""Gigi"" is a lot of fun, and a good way to spend two hours. 8/10 --Shelly "	6.8	0

And the interior sets are equally beautiful. can relate. Sandra likes Saxon and sneaks out to see him. A wonderfully hilarious comedy~ Don't miss this movie. You will be glad you saw it. Go buy it because you are going to want to see it over and over again. I think I will slip my copy in the VCR now and  enjoy this movie too. Enjoy! According to Mr. Harrison's autobiography, he knew his wife was dying, but she did not know. This movie is a wonderful valentine Rex Harrison gave to his wife, Kay Kendall.A few years earlier, Kay Kendall made a very funny movie, ""Simon and Laura"" with Peter Finch.  Movie is not available on video, so watch  for it on television. comic timing is superb and so is her dress sense! She looks totally fabulous in this film. It's terribly sad to see it and realize that she had not long to live. Film comedy lost a jewel in her.According to the closing credits of 'What Every Girl Wants', 'The Reluctant Debutante' inspired that lamentable movie. Don't watch that; watch this! pretty funny and quite romantic. I think most of this is due to good writing and the nice gentle nature of the film. In fact, the longer I watched it, the more I liked it and found myself really being pulled into the story. It's a very good and often overlooked film--pity, as it really should be more widely seen.

Adventures of Robin Hood, The (1938)	"with Errol Flynn.As she watched it she saw the reverence and respect the audience had for both of these classics. When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now, she was real proud to have been associated with these films.You have every reason to be proud Olivia. And we're real proud of you. Michael Curtiz's masterpiece. Here, everything works. Other than Erroll Flynn - even if when's he is on the screen is difficult to pay attention to anyone else - we do. Mostly because Claude Rains, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and the rest of the sensational cast.

He vows that Robin must be captured...Winner of 3 Academy Awards (Art Direction, Original Score and Film Editing) ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is a delighted tale of high adventure, a tale of action and colorful pageantry, a great film for all the family... as it was seventy years ago, when it won its Academy Award. From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel, when Robin and Gisbourne meet ""once too often"", this picture richly deserves its reputation as *the* Robin Hood on film - from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned. tremendously wide variety of types.

Mark of Zorro, The (1940)	"unheard music... With a touch of a great filmmaker, Mamoulian mixes harmoniously movement and action, decor and lightning with rage and turmoil, heroism and romance...Under Alfred Newman's Oscar-Nominated score and despite the unusual absence of Technicolor, the film (the first of the great Tyrone Power swashbucklers ) is great fun, full of vitality and suspense, an exciting, deliciously ironic swashbuckler... fun film with great dialogue and should be on everyone's ""must see"" list.  One curious thing.......how did those very revealing tight pants worn by Power and Rathbone get by the Hays Office?  These were the days when you could not even show a married couple sharing the same bed and those pants didn't leave much to the imagination! when it was discovered that Fox only had the rights to the title, THE MARK OF ZORRO; the name 'Zorro' belonged to another studio, ending any possibility of a follow-up).Tyrone Power had joined Errol Flynn as the reigning 'kings' of swashbucklers, a title both would find amusing, if limiting, but which would be how both actors are best remembered, today! two years before. Linda Darnell is so sweet and beautiful that seems to be the inspiration for the title of the novel of Vladimir Nabokov. J. Edward Bromberg and Basil Rathbone are the perfect villains, the first one coward and sleazy and the second arrogant and corrupt. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Marca do Zorro"" (""The Mark of Zorro"") Why can't they make action flicks like this anymore? To paraphrase a certain famous political catchphrase, ""it's the characters, stupid."" Everybody in this movie is colorful and cool, and through them I get wrapped up in the plot. When the biggest complaint I have is a bit of rear-screen projection during a boat ride, you know the movie's almost perfect. "	7.6	1
Laura (1944)	Laura are coming true, as she appears through the doorway. He awakens and rises from the chair, his soul shaken by the sight of Laura alive.This intriguing story, combined with Clifton Webb's biting quips, Gene Tierney's beauty and elegance, Dana Andrews' intensity and dark good looks, and Vincent Price's sense of humor, makes this film immensely watchable again and again. to fall for Laura posthumously.  Clifton Webb plays her mentor perfectly and Vincent Price is classic as Laura's pretty boy fiance.  Although the movie begins with Laura's murder, it still has incredible surprises and an awesome denouement.  Andrews hard boiled detective and the dark, raining sets illustrate the meaning of film noir.  I highly recommend it. it keeps you thoroughly absorbed until it reaches its satisfying climax under Otto Preminger's knowing direction. Not to be missed, it's a classic of its kind.For a detailed look at the career of DANA ANDREWS, see my current article on him in FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE, Summer 2001 with a look at all of his films and many photos.   Even upon multiple viewings I can't help but howl at some of his lines and mannerisms.  If anyone was to request suggestions for good Film Noir movies, I would prescribe a heavy dose of `Laura' because it has something for everyone in that it is romantic, thrilling, mysterious, wickedly funny and above all, thoroughly entertaining.  --Shelly of sophisticated noir police drama. It's dialog will leave you begging for more. It's not much in the way of mystery because about a third of the way through you will realize at the same time Andrews does who the murderer is, maybe even before Andrews does. That doesn't matter though because Laura is entertaining every step of the way. 	8.1	1

From here the love story begins; we see the mutual respect and admiration that Captain Gregg and Mrs. Muir have for eachother.The love is pure and true,on a higher plane; not hindered  or comprimised by sexual intimacy.The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is a love story that like its characters transcends time. score that is as moving and powerful as the tides that beat throughout this film.I find a personal connection to this story in that it takes me back to the days I lived on a northern island that was similarly beautiful though tinged with the bittersweet loneliness of a remote place awash in the deep undercurrents of sorrow and melancholy. the sea. Mr. Harrison plays well opposite Ms. Tierney; their chemistry works well because it combines his rugged good looks and her beauty.The supporting players are good under Mr. Mankiewicz' direction.

Horton's anger at Mitchell when he learned the latter's identity is understandable. Mitchell's involvement in installing new pipes in Shangri-La mirrors Insull's early days, when he was an electrician, and an assistant to Thomas Edison.The use of these two real figures as the basis of the characters helped contemporary audiences to accept the background of the plot of the film. and Champlin more in awe of the result. There is even an alternative ending included that Columbia chief Harry Cohn insisted on filming and using upon release, but it had thankfully been dropped two weeks later. This is a genuine treat for cinemaphiles, as there are few films that make such a compelling case for seeking out one's personal utopia. Shortly after he turns to look at Shangri-La for the last time before plunging into the outside world and again, silently, his emotions touch us all. (At least they touch me!) We are very fortunate to have this masterpiece available to us. Now, will future generations recognize this film for what it is? Judging from today's ""hits"" I really wonder. "	7.8	1
Top Hat (1935)	"so you can finally say that you've seen a Fred/Ginger movie, and now know what all that fuss was about. Because, goodness, there really is nothing quite so magical as when Astaire takes Rogers in his arms and spins her around a dance floor, defying gravity and all laws of motion. Physics means nothing when it comes to these two... amusing.  Edward Everett Horton is both funny and indispensable as Fred's friend (and the man whom Ginger thinks Fred is), and the rest of the supporting players are also quite good.This is the kind of carefully produced classic that offers many reasons for watching - see it if you have the chance, whether or not you usually like musicals. Swing Time, Shall We Dance, and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle and The Barkleys of Broadway, the last two because they had quite plausible stories, (and in the case of Castle, one based on real life).  But still, Top Hat is Fred and Ginger at their best, and hopefully will always stay that way in my mind. Horton, Helen Broderick, and Eric Blore. These three character actors are at their finest in the film. They make everything work because they are always there to lend a hand for the stars to shine without being on the way.""Top Hat"" is a happy film that keeps delighting viewers any time one is lucky enough to fall under its spell. from his wife Madge for 24 hours, even though they haven't met for weeks and they are staying in the same hotel.  This is highly artificial, but such flaws are rendered negligible by the sweeping climax of ""Cheek To Cheek"", the splendid finale in which Fred and Ginger get to dance as lovers.Verdict - Immortal stylish music and dance.

James Dean put himself 'out there' emotionally in such a raw way that the power of that brave acting yet holds the ability to touch the audience with every viewing.  I think the film makes a hugely important statement about the human condition that is still valid a half a century later. distant to the viewer, for example, which is appropriate to the final state of his character, but which could have been explained better in transformation.But this is a fabulous film, with grand, biblical and universal subtexts and an unusually developed but extremely charming romance. Unless you're completely averse to realist drama, you must see East of Eden at least once. so long for me to finally see this movie, but I was impressed. (May I recommend the two-disc, special-edition DVD?). This movie is wonderfully directed, acted and photographed.

Thin Man, The (1934)	"that all the movies they worked together on were made at frantic pace. Part of the reason that The Thin Man moves so quickly is the fact that production was so hurried.The Thin Man gets a ten out of ten from me for being one of the best films ever produced, and one of my absolute favorites of all time. a comic masterpiece that continually tricks the viewers, and without a doubt, one of the very best and brightest movies of the 1930s. I hope I can watch the other ""Thin Man"" movies. I will definitely be reading the book. The film ended half an hour ago, but I already feel like going back for a second helping. Rating: 10/10 is so thoroughly enjoyable, and its stars (including Asta) are so engaging that I look forward to seeing more in the six-film series. Rent this one or catch it on Turner Classic Movies, like I did. It is well worth seeing, and surely an inspiration to many film genres ranging from screwball comedies to detective stories. A very strong 8/10.--Shelly remembers him. 'Do you know anything about the case?' 'Yes, it's putting me way behind in my drinking.'

A real winner.Camera Obscura --- 9/10 science, swindles, two dinner parties and drinking... lots and lots of drinking... all combine into one hell of fun movie.

He was right! see the film it's a chance to see a lot of great cinema names at one time doing real characters instead of just walking on as themselves.The film holds up well today and can still be enjoyed.

It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful... a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas. strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter.

The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5. sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches.  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.  And in giving this rating, either I'm damn right or I'm crazy. about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart's troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well.

One scene after another at breakneck pace, but never a dull moment.  As soon as one laugh stops, another one begins.  In case you haven't gotten the point, I highly suggest you see this movie.  It may be 60 years old, but it's still hilarious. couldn't describe it in any event.May Robson and Charlie Ruggles lend good support. Ruggles who was normally cast against Mary Boland teams up well with May Robson. And my favorite in the supporting cast is Walter Catlett as the small town constable who doesn't know quite what he has on his hands, but is determined to bluff the situation through. he plays George, who, barking his stubby tail off, has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this high-strung wire-haired terrier is and will forever be (pace Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie) Hollywood's top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby, the most exquisite comedy of the sound era. "	8.0	1

The ending was a complete surprise. If you like Cary Grant or old Hollywood movies, this is something different. Sad, but sentimental. Recommended. This film is a gift to the audience. Grant and Dunne show their adeptness at establishing and making us believe they are an intimate married couple. Irene Dunne is at the height of sensitivity and softness here, a true lady with beautiful hair and hairstyles. What a movie. And one cannot forget our beloved Apple Jack, such a sweet soul. there may be a few moments when the sentimentality gets dangerously high, most of the time it remains balanced, and certainly more so than is the case with present-day movies of this kind.  It's far from flawless, but it is generally effective in telling the kind of story that takes a combination of sensitivity and restraint to tell believably. his adopted baby girl, it brings a lump to my throat every time I see it. Irene Dunne was a classy lady in anything she did, and can be as quietly funny as she can be dramatic, as she demonstrated in this film.

Of Human Bondage (1934)	"barrage of blood-curdling insults. Bette Davis as Mildred never fails to raise the hair on the back of my neck and arms with her performance in this particular scene.This is the role that made Davis a star. It's also one of my all-time favorite Davis films, along with such others as ""The Little Foxes"", ""The Letter"", and ""All About Eve"". Howard's Philip Carey is a shy man with a deep inferiority complex because of his club foot. He clings to Mildred because even though she's degraded him, he feels he'll never find another attachment again. For both the leads Of Human Bondage represented a considerable stretching of considerable talents. The two later screen versions are markedly inferior to this one. shocking for it's day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred's vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him (""You cad, you dirty swine...."") is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film. when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: ""I wiped my mouth! I WIPED MY MOUTH!!"" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental.IMDb votes concur! that I didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. They'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would have never been interested in Mildred. That's just the simple truth... See it!! "	7.3	0

It deserves far better treatment than it has received since its copyright lapsed. done for TV back in 1980, but fell flat.  So bad was that version, that they should pay you to watch it.  Yet if someone was to do it correctly today, they would have a real gem on their hands.If you haven't seen the original 1946 version, catch it on TV.  It belongs in everybody's movie-watching repertoire. She may be his salvation.

Lots of good character actors playing brawny devils, lunkheaded mooks, tough dames, flustered Man Fridays and such.

Definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the oldies. patient but suffering fiancée, endeavoring to understand the difference in the judge's personality. As the Devil, Claude Rains is inspired casting.

But it's the kind of story that's easy to watch over again when it is told the right way. beauty???!!! I have little faith in our rapidly decaying culture as we enter the new century, especially when such travesties occur. Once again, there is absolutely NO valid, logical excuse for this.

They Made Me a Criminal (1939)	as a tough New York cop?).Busby Berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers.  The film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed.  The ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but I still found this a highly enjoyable experience. the start of the movie. Why knowing that Jack/Johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.  Berkeley would never settle for a point-and-shoot look to his film.  His camera is all over the place, even underwater when the kids take over a water tank.  There's all the stock characters of old cinema her e- the nice girl who softens Garfield's heart, the spry old grannie, the tough NYC cops and reporters. Fun movie. and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.Other performances besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield's trail. as a tough-cop character that doesn't really make the best use of his strengths.In keeping everything together and on-track, Busby Berkeley shows the same kind of skill that enabled him to produce the variety numbers for which he was better known. He comes in for his share of the credit here in creating an interesting movie with some unusual features. 	7.0	0

Films today just don't use actors with faces like his any longer.  Too bad.Yes indeed, The Angel and The Badman is a wonderful, old fashioned  film. The kind they don't make any longer, but should. Capra disparaged Grant as a bad influence on Wayne when they quarreled during the filming of Circus World. Grant did write some of the more conservative on Wayne's films. But I certainly can't fault anything he did in The Angel and the Badman.In fact it's a winner in just about every respect. Even some Wayne haters might like this one. natural ""Angelic"" qualities. The camera really loves her. There's one scene where she confesses' her love for Wayne, and is surprised he doesn't feel quite the same: ""I never thought it could happen to one and not another."" Her outright innocence in this scene is incredibly touching, and endearing, and you see how this affects Wayne in the same way. Wayne constantly threatening him, but almost like a self-appointed guardian who sees Quirt's potential for good, trying to steer him toward the light. Carey's humor, and good spirit plays off Wayne perfectly.The film builds to a brilliant finish, with Quirt forced to choose between peace or violence once and for all. One of my favorite westerns. Great cast, great story. as the marshall, he's constantly stalking Quirt. He's sure that someday he'll get to hang the guy, and he harps on it constantly. The chemistry between Wayne and Russell adds an unexpected poignancy to the film. The scene where the two pick blackberries is simply beautiful, and their wordless climactic exchange is perfectly performed. Good action sequences, as well. 9/10. "	7.0	0

Most action in this movie takes place off camera, this creates a feeling of 'being there.' One character mentions that all the action he has seen he had to listen to it.

Outlaw, The (1943)	the actors are painful in their beauty. Many of the IMDb comments suggest that the film wants watching several times. I second that.

Toland can be thanked for giving us the movie's clarity. --And Howard... Howard was just having fun. was a lot that didn't fit well at all - including a dreadful musical score and some ham-fisted attempts at humour. The movie also includes surprisingly little gunplay for a Western. There's really not very much of interest here, but for Russell's sheer beauty as well as the over the top bizarre-ness of the whole thing, it gets a 4/10. dreadful (Tchaikovsky was it? mixed with cartoon type sounds) I still found myself admiring Russell, who for most red blooded males of my age has been a great inspiration. Like Shane, and others, I think this was a film of its time, and probably doesn't deserve to be judged by this generation, who are seeing it for the first time. Brothers romp but not nearly as intentionally funny. The whole thing is contrived, there's a lot of talk, talk, talk, and if there is some underlying message, I missed it. BUT, you have to see it for the camp value......it's really more fun than it should be. Maybe Mr. Hughes meant it that way. On second thought, I guess not. two years to pass the censors due to the shameless display of Russell's ample assets(36D).

Night of the Living Dead (1968)	"the lead character. Romero has always presented intelligent non-stereotypical black characters in his films. This film was made in 1968 while civil rights tensions were high, and the most ""in control"" character in the whole movie is a black man. If you can get past a couple of cheesy supporting performances, this is one of the best horror films ever. of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this. made). The film is still effective because it all has a feeling of impending doom. It seems hopeless, disturbing, terrifying because of the claustrophobic mood it sets. It's not the zombies that scare us, it's the idea of being trapped in a small area with nowhere to go and death itself standing right outside your door. What a brilliant film!8/10 unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage.  Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben - who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat, realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion.  An excellent flagship for low budget horrors. through the rest of this film and the two superb sequels that followed.This is perhaps one of the greatest low budget cult movies ever made, certainly one of the most influential, and in its brutally harrowing documentary style conclusion a harsh statement on American racial attitudes.

Some viewers may not get the joke--much of BEAT THE DEVIL requires the ability to appreciate covert humor--but those who do will find the movie bears repeat viewing. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer right?).The resolution is lame - the characters all look ready to leave the set and get drunk before undertaking a new film.  But this is one of the best spoofs of the noir genre and what makes it fly is the ensemble of first-rate actors in roles neatly the opposite of those they were usually seen performing.Rent it! (Please) for being unrealistic, Huston's and Capote's comic script has none-to-funny real parallels in the present day debacles of Enron and WorldCom. In ""Beat the Devil,"" greed and deceit are brilliantly juxtaposed to reveal the ultimate folly of even the most devious criminal enterprise. This is a superior black comedy that plays even better today than it did 52 years ago. Devil ground (Zoolander), but none of them ever reach it for fear of the audience not getting it, as I understand most of Beat the Devils audience of 1954 did not get it. Imagine Mike Myers playing Austin Powers straight, and not trying to be funny in all the situations he's in. To me, that would be immensely more funny. case, Bogart gave an immensely satisfying performance in his tongue-in-cheek role and the film itself has now become a regular attraction in Bogart film retrospectives...

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)	"remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a very appropriate title.  It is a searing, wonderfully acted film that I will not soon forget.  I recommend those who haven't seen it yet to rent it as soon as they get a chance.  A true classic. Williams's stuff is talky, and with the drabness of a typical Williams set, this can be a bit oppressive. With color, and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters, his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended, I think he has given us something just as fine. Mae's personalities, even those which bespeak traditional values, are portrayed as petty and unimaginative.  Even if one believes that Gooper and Mae have done all the right things, they have done them for the wrong reasons. Thus the theme of the story is most clearly presented:  all that is important is to love and to express that love. right and Taylor certainly doesn't disappoint in the role. But it turns out that ultimately the film is really about the relationship between Brick and his father, not Brick and his wife. And as such it is Newman, and most especially Ives, who you will most remember. It is their work which transforms a good movie into something truly memorable. are breathtakingly beautiful in their portrayals. This is probably not a good family movie, as Brick has a serious drinking problem and Maggie IS so desperate for his affections, and probably not a good Friday/Saturday night movie, but I still love it, and will think of it fondly for the rest of my life.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.

This heady, romanticized peek into the life of Americans abroad has its allure, and, though you don't believe it for a minute, it makes you want to sip a Pastis and light up a Gitane. strong women who fill the screen with power and grace.  But with `Far From Heaven' and `The Hours' I may be wrong about forever.   I recommend this admittedly dated but charming film for anyone who wants to see what screen acting is all about. It is about thinking and Miss Taylor is a master at the craft. an older man now...57 years old.  I had to reach for my hanky several times.  The love...the joy...the tears... and the sorrow of a man for his wife and his child. Well...well...it is too bad they don't have movies like this anymore.  I miss them.

Meet John Doe (1941)	"the role of Fascist D.B. Norton. This film is even more relevant today than when it was made, and I would argue that it should be viewed in high schools across the continent. Capra is asking his viewers to think critically of EVERYTHING they hear on the radio or see in papers or hear from elites, and amen to that! find all your views being voiced by different characters at various points in the tale, opening the question of just who is the average everyman that Capra is seeking to show? - and how do they relate to you?This movie is ten stars all over. Even for keen Capra fans, the expectation is surpassed by the final delivery. Thoroughly recommended. when the rest of the film is way ahead of the game.Like the equally dark `It's a Wonderful Life,' Capra's genius is that he knows how to pitch and score the important points when necessary, not only with laughter and tears, but with unyielding hope and, most significantly, with words.  It's more than any home crowd can ask for. and langs techniques in this work are absoloutly astounding. The riot scene should be looked upon as ground breaking. The performances (both the lead and supporting) are among some of the finest and most endearing of the time. Needless to say I'm going to be toot this films horn for quite some time.

Finally, the movie succeeds not just because of its attributes that can carry over to other forms of art such as books or plays, but also because it is a uniquely cinematic experience. "	7.7	1
Algiers (1938)	"third film version of Pepe Le Moko's story with Casbah starring Tony Martin. It was a musical version that fell short of establishing Martin as a big screen draw, but the songs were some of his best selling records.Still though Boyer does a fabulous job as Pepe, though I would some day like to see Jean Gabin's version for comparison. film that have become famous over the years and it's fun just looking for things that you've heard or seen before. I'm not sure how much Warner Brother's cartoons based their stinky skunk (Pepe le Pew) on Charles Boyer's character Pepe le Moko but there has be some correlation.Anyway, Algiers is a grand piece of entertainment well worth the watching. marry an elderly wide-girthed fellow; my goodness, for her anything's better than that! There's a youngish Leonid Kinskey also appearing as a supporting actor, along with reliable Alan Hale (formerly Robin Hood's buddy, more or less) and Gene Lockhart, whom I've never seen in such a serious role as this one. It's a movie that stands the test of time. mentioned. Charles Boyer was great as Pepe La Moko, and so was Gene Lochart as the informer. To me, the ending was most tragic, and I will never forget the fading ship sailing away and Hedy's vision, never to see her lover again. No wonder its a classic. They don't make movies like these anymore, the pity of it all. a musical :in what is primarily a film noir,it's thoroughly incongruous.Many of the great lines of the French classic can be heard ,notably the famous ""I'm an informer,I'm not a hypocrite"",and the Boyer/Lamarr pairing displays a special chemistry .The black and white makes a good use of shadows and lights.If all the remakes were made with care like this one.....

Something to Sing About (1937)	Hungarian star set up as Cagney's love interest by the studio press machine. She's neither attractive nor talented, and one has to wonder why she was supposed to be such a big star.This movie is out on DVD, unlike all too many of Cagney's early efforts, and it's worth checking out for a side of Cagney seen entirely too seldom. things and gets down in the dumps about his performances. Little does Terry realize that the producers and directors all like Terry and feel he is doing a great job, but Bennett Regan does not want to tell him that in order to keep him from getting a big head on his shoulders. Great Cagney film with outstanding dance routines. tape and DVD for years and is widely available here..like a lot of weird and small RKO titles. Lucky us and lucky you if you can find them. Grand national was a good outfit. The opening and closing nightclub scenes in this film are really smart and quite elaborate. There's even a BIG-like keyboard dance solo. And that Logo! Wow! trained singer makes for a comely female lead as well, while William Frawley as a press agent, Mona Barrie as the studio diva, and Philip Ahn, who plays Rooney's houseboy, all provide enjoyable turns. Director Victor Schertzinger utilizes his own Academy Award nominated score to a liberal extent throughout and the product becomes a tuneful and rather undervalued musical comedy. Frawley, the future Fred Mertz, of I Love Lucy Fame, steals the picture as a publicity agent hell-bent on getting Cagney stature no matter what the cost.There is that accidental item that could cause a fatal rift between the married couple but Hollywood knew how to settle that so well in a final staging of a song and dance number. 	6.4	0
Farewell to Arms, A (1932)	accent plays Cooper's friend and romantic rival, Major Rinaldi. Menjou was great at playing both American and continental types. Soon he would sign a long term contract with MGM and gain his greatest roles during the sound era.Hemingway purists might shun A Farewell to Arms, but those who love their screen romances, soggier the better will rave about this film. film career of famous stage actress Helen Hayes (1900-1993) at her peak. As it stands, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, a poignant love story, which may not stir up as many tears and sobs as it once did way back when, it is, however, a worthy novel to screen offering, ranking this the first, and best, of two remakes combined. (****) to tears.  How wonderful to see Coop so vulnerable and so in love, and Hayes just shines from the screen like a diamond.This film is very under-rated.  The camerawork is ground-breaking and original - look for the shot when Hayes kisses Cooper as he is wheeled into his hospital room.  Amazing.  I really love this film. Gary Cooper's Frederick is similarly far more animated than Rock Hudson's stony-faced interpretation of the role, and he receives good support from Adolphe Menjou as Frederick's comrade Major Rinaldi. The action is better paced and the film, even if it looks primitive by today's standards, nevertheless has a vigour lacking from many more polished films from more recent times. 7/10 you can find a print of the film that you can stand to watch. It is sad but true: the 1932 A FAREWELL TO ARMS seems to have fallen into public domain, and the result is a host of DVD and VHS releases that range from the merely adequate to the incredibly dire.

Moonlight Murder (1936)	"dubbed by Alfonso Pedroso) was quite good. Most of the singing was okay despite some screechy high notes.A little baby boomer trivia: For us boomers, Carrillo was Pancho on ""The Cisco Kid,"" and the Cisco Kid was Duncan Renaldo - who is listed in the cast here. As a friend of mine used to say, ""foreshadowing."" Ah, Pancho; ah, Cisco. so good about this film? Mainly the short running time combined with, IMHO, an excess of opera music. The time taken up by the opera music could have been used to beef up the plot a bit more. Still I'd recommend it for fans of B murder mysteries from the 30's and 40's and definitely for fans of Chester Morris. part, and I enjoyed watching him. Interesting that Duncan Renaldo (a very attractive young tenor in the film) teamed up with Carillo to play Cisco and Pancho in The Cisco Kid later on. This may be classed as a ""B"" film but there is a great deal of talent here, and Hollywood quality touches (like the truly good singing talent). Universal's 1939 ""The House of Fear"" as well. Director Edwin L. Marin never seemed to escape the 'B' tag (even at MGM), his best remembered features including his debut ""The Death Kiss,"" ""A Study in Scarlet,"" ""Bombay Mail,"" ""The Crosby Case,"" ""The Casino Murder Case,"" ""The Garden Murder Case,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Invisible Agent,"" ""Tall in the Saddle,"" and ""Nocturne."" setup of various characters' motives is rather involved and there is a fair amount of music, as well, so the story itself moves somewhat deliberately. The complicated plot eventually arrives at a surprising (and unlikely) resolution.It's certainly not the best B mystery ever made, but MGM's production values, the somewhat unusual setting, and a fun cast make it very watchable.

Nothing Personal (1995)	to a boiling point, and predictably, the ending is a tragic one. What makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict. Being American, I can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about. But, I do know there has to be a better way.All in all, a well acted, touching...but troubling film. very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores.All in all, it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast. It wont move the earth, although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries. to . It's actually that is very good at portraying a sense of time and place which RESURRECTION MAN failed to do . Like I said this is a very good film that felt the need to over do the dramatics in the last ten minutes which while not totally ruining the film stops it from being a classic one it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. On the other it deals with a Loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10. members are depicted as ruthless terrorists (The devil's own, Patriot games). What all these movies have in common is that the loyalists are not even mentioned. Nothing Personal shows the true nature of the conflict, as a bloody and cruel gang war between the two parties, and on top of that, bloody internal conflicts in the two camps as well. 	6.9	0
Dangerous Ground (1997)	the door of their hotel suite?And there should be a bounty on the head of the person who penned the line ``Steven was in over his head -- but so was the country.''

Shame, shame, shame. feeling like just another gangsta movie.  They touched on the problems of South Africa but ultimately this story could have been set almost anywhere. The South Africa setting is just incidental.  The lines between good & bad are too easily drawn - the characters seem 1 dimensional at times. Different and interesting, but ultimately unfulfilling in some ways. taken up a notch or two. And of course the writing is so thin and predictable if it was a dress it'd be see-through.I don't think it's as horrible as the first reviewer (mainly because I have been to Johannesburg and it DOES look that old an worn-out) but agree that the writing and acting was not up to par. the death of his father, where his family informs him about his brother who has gone missing. Here he meets up with his brother's girlfriend played by Liz Hurley, who is heavily into heroin. They then set about finding his brother, which includes Shooting people, blowing things up, blah, blah, blah. After a while it all gets a bit predictable. dull  the interesting cast make it worth one watch but no more than that.  The mix of `stay in school kids' and `just say no' is too heavy and labourious, but is made even more pointless by the film's conclusion that the best way to deal with criminals destroying an area is to get guns and kill them! 	4.5	0
Picnic (1955)	on for the whole cartoon as Tom follows the dogs and the picnic basket to the woods. You can guess most of the rest. Most of the sight gags are decent: not spectacular, but entertaining enough. A nice twist occurs near the end when an army of ants spots the food and gets in on the fun.Overall, slightly-better than average. a Picnic is rather predictable nonsense, although nice bright and colourful animation goes some way to compensate for the predictable antics of cat, mouse and dogs. The cartoon's best gag is a simple one: Tom's pathetic apologetic laugh when he is caught red handed, although the marching ants that appear at the end of the cartoon are quite fun too. basket(but of course that little mouse is too crafty for him), and the ending with the ants and the food was a funny touch. It is great to see Spike, and his son is really cute. And of course, Tom and Jerry are wonderful as well as per usual. Overall, a really pleasant Tom and Jerry cartoon. 8/10 Bethany Cox 	7.4	0
Madagascar Skin (1995)	"gave ""value added"" as far as I'm concerned.The performances are excellent. The story is compelling and somewhat mysterious. The photography is inventive and evocative.

I'm putting this film in my top ten gay movies list. would read, like the title of an old Stephen Stills song: ""LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH.""  And the actors work wonders with their characters. Bernard Hill is excellent as Flint, while John Hannah takes risks with almost every part he plays.A great film from Channel 4 and the British Film Institute. You'll love it ""as long as you're straight!"" a really good film considering the talent involved.  And I couldn't really believe the basic premise that this attractive man had never experienced sex because of a simple skin defect.  Granted many gay males are overtly narcissistic, but certainly not to that extreme.  And why did Flint suddenly go from 'straight' to 'gay' with no coherent explanation. put in the same flaming suitcase in which the main protagonist cremates a past of shallow pursuits. The pushy symbolism & stylistics (metaphysical shoes on the seashore, dead fish and squids by truckload, ""significant"" tattoos, and - oh, dear - lightnings during first encounter in bed) create a world of no plausibility and suck all blood out of the characters. cannot stand even hints of animal suffering in movies, so when Harry started telling about his job in the research lab I hit the STOP button hard, and I will not go back.I know I will be ridiculed and reviled for writing this, particularly by coolly cynical Europeans if past experience is any indication, but that is just too bad.

Fly Away Home (1996)	here she and Daniels and the minimal dialogue of the script work so well.

That's it. Parents, you can show this to young children without any real concern. My suggestion: Watch the first 5 minutes of the film and if you decide your children can handle the opening sequence of a car crash, then there probably is nothing else in the film that should be a problem (in my opinion!) overwhelming beauty is in their living. They deserved that life. It made me think of this sad planet and the billions of creatures that have died because of the human race. Here was a story that went against the slaughter. When Amy and her birds arrived at their destination in Chesapeake Bay I had misty eyes.So I'm a soft touch. The views in Fly away Home of Amy's geese as they move in to join the hundreds of wild geese powering South capture this majesty. This story of a group of people who care about and assist this natural pattern may help reinforce some of the awe that we should all feel when confronted with these epic and annual journeys. at adults. The supporting cast also flesh out their strong characters to make the whole film much more believable.The cinematography is beautiful, the dusky-autumnal scenes are captured in an explosion of reds and yellows and oranges that seem to wash over you time and time again, and the final flight sequence is a wonderful closing to an incredibly refreshing film. 	6.8	0
Bliss (1997)	"the players and the images and content stayed with me for weeks afterwards. It is not for the prudish but if you are in the mood for a powerful film about human sexuality, marriage, and how the dance between the partners can and should be, this is a movie for you. Watch it with someone that you care deeply about. Terence Stamp makes it all work. Both Sheffer and Lee do excellent jobs as well. in emotionally. There aren't too many movies that focus on the relationship within marriage, and give powerful hope for the unimaginable possibilities within it. Bliss definitely does this. It's very real, and I thought the acting was excellent. Perhaps I'm easily moved, but I found myself sitting close to the screen, fully emotionally locked into the script. My grade? A- audacious performances in this unique love story.  The music is amazing.  It works so well in the film, and it hightens the mood of the movie very well.  Not everyone will like it.  A film about adult sexuality, where sex isn't portrayed in a cartoonish ""teenage"" way, is a daring idea.  But it works beautifully. husband like Joseph places on his partner and marriage. The more it is viewed, the better and educational it gets, rather than having to read and view many volumes of text and videos on the subject of Tantric lovemaking, a subject that has it's poo-hoo critics.I will be waiting eagerly for Lance Young's sequel to this excellent movie, if any.

Grace of My Heart (1996)	"is very good & has that 60's, 70's feel to it. I just wish the soundtrack album had included the tunes ""Hey There"" & ""Grace Of My Heart"" by Kristen Vigard who did the vocals for Illeana Douglas. If you like nostalgic movies about pop music like ""The Idolmaker"", ""Grease"", ""That Thing You Do"" & ""Hairspray"" you'll like this too. the songs. I thought the movie lost something when it moved west to California but was deeply moved by Douglas and Turturro 'having it out' at the empty poolside. The final song with the flashbacks and her crowning achievement of recording that ""one great album"" had me weeping again. I really like this movie so I ordered the DVD online. original music is great, too. The film moves seamlessly from the fifties through the seventies due in part to the talent of the actors, but also due to the impressive costume and makeup work and the wonderful original music written for each period. Y'know how people often say of good movies, ""You'll laugh/You'll cry""? Well this is one of those. that hinder your enjoyment of the film?  Give me a break.If you don't like a film, at least do us all the favor of giving good reasons and at least ATTEMPT to make intelligent comments rather than the half-baked crap we see here.This film was excellent.  The soundtrack was amazing, the actors were even more amazing.  10/10 unlike Beach Boy Brian Wilson. Some parts are a bit too dramatic, but the songs in the movie--composed by the Brill writers make up for it. The highlight is Douglas's lip sync(sung by Kristen Vigard), written by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello. Good rock and roll movie.

Brother of Sleep (Schlafes Bruder) (1995)	"However for those who like psychological thrillers andstories about misunderstood and socially inept geniuses, this is amazing. The music and cinematography is fantastic. Plus this film incorporated 3 of my favorite German actors. The way that the sound was utilized is just unbelievable as well.For the intellectuals out there who appreciate art in all things, rent or buy this one. the ""tortured artist"" persona that is Elias - the isolation, the dedication to your craft in spite of other desires which we cannot displace, and the embodiment of the emotional realm that so frequently serves as the origin of our inspiration ... this is what the story is truly about.

The girl is the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge.In my book this is one fine action movie. only one Van Damme film...see Maximum Risk.  It is a decent thriller, not just a martial arts flick.  Unfortunately, after seeing how good Van Damme can be (yes, he can act - something we've yet to see from Stephen Seagal who he's usually compared to) it makes you sad to see how many bad films he's really made. the viewer with excellent action sequences. This is definitely Van Damme's best turn as an actor. Natasha Henstridge does a rather decent turn as the damsel in distress, and creates good chemistry between herself and Van Damme. I don't see why this was a huge flop in theaters; it's surely Van Damme's best and at heart an exciting action flick. 	5.5	0
Michael Collins (1996)	"Liam Neeson is big enough to tie it all together. It would also be nice for him to have a constant foil. Whether or not he deserves it historically, the movie seems to make De Valera Collins' foil. It would be great to fully embrace the conflict and give De Valera more screen time. Make this Collins versus De Valera. all, Michael Collin's tactics were not pretty, everything from car-bombings to mob-style executions. Yet we still care for him, we want him to succeed, even if he himself isn't sure he wants to.Without it's politics, this movie is still excellent. It's a great piece of movie-making, it's involving, sad, funny and sometimes tense. One of the movies I consider classic. pull off the Irish thing too well. However, given his character, Eamon de Valera, it isn't really a miscast, just takes time to get in.If you can ignore how horrible Julia Roberts is and think about the heart and emotion behind this film while enjoying the awesome score you're in for a treat.

I wish I had a howitzer like that. was in it to boost box office ratings - although I would have hardly thought that necessary with Neeson and Rickman as the main characters.

Rich Man's Wife, The (1996)	gushing, but I have worked a lot of movies with a lot of actors, and she really did stand out.  All in all, I don't think you can lose by spending a little time with this movie, but I have to warn you:  There are more plot holes in it than there are pot holes in Jersey City. some stupidity, and the jump scenes in it are predictable. Plus the film itself is predictable, but it is good, and it worth watching. Halle Berry is sensational as The Rich Man's Wife. The ending is especially satisfying, making your jaw drop to the ground. I give it a 7 out of 10. Rated R for strong violence and language. Greene(Cole Wilson)? This film was predictable in many parts and the lighting was really bad.However,Halle Berry was very pretty in this movie and yes she actually does cry.Just dont make the same mistake I did and stay up til' 3 o'clock in the morning.But what the heck I was bored.To wrap this comment up I give it a 6/10 * hitting a moving target with a handgun is not as easy as it looks in most Hollywood products.The camera loves Halle Berry and here she displays some acting chops that would prove that she was not just another (very) pretty girl. So this is an average to slightly above average Neo-Noir that can be enjoyed for the best of it. Very good cast, direction, acting, sets and if you live in Australia and you see a copy of this movie, get it straight away because it is extremely rare since it is only on video now and they have stopped all production of videos.

I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything.I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama.Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film. milestone.Might I add that I have always felt that Matthew Broderick is a fantastic actor, especially in roles that require an average looking, quiet introspective character. He is perfect for this cinematic vehicle, and equal to the talents of a Tom Hanks any day. I was also impressed that he produced, directed and shared writing credits on this film project. initiate the challenge, whereas in real life, it was the hapless abacus salesman who challenged him, completely unaware that he was taking on a renowned physicist. Therefore, the sense of irony, and of Feinman's idiosyncrasy in the world of mere mortals, is lost.

Big Night (1996)	the preparation and serving of food presented so beautifully and lovingly in a movie. The final, wordless scene, in which a simple omelette is prepared and the brothers express their reconciliation, is, for me, one of the most eloquently poetic codas I have ever seen. This is a warm-hearted movie with a great deal of humor that rates an A+. common ground, for further evaluation and perhaps some adjustments. The movie, quite appropriately, doesn't reveal the direction that our immigrants will take. However, it beautifully displays the quiet coexistence of three personalities in a more persuasive journey!I wonder if `the Big Night' is an adaptation of Freudian Psychoanalysis. If so could you identify `Id', ` Ego' and  `superego'? SR Because, at its heart, this is a character-driven piece -- about the love and mutual respect shared by two strong-willed siblings.  Someday I will take part in a feast like that shared by the characters in this film, and on that day, I will be an extraordinarily happy man.  Until then, I'll watch this movie again and again. hopes and dreams and struggles -- some within reach, some not. It's got a good cast too. They all make it look easy, but they have a charming script and careful direction. I think Billy Wilder would have approved. At turns funny and touching, and the last scene -- several minutes without a word of dialogue -- is pure gold. most beautiful and poignant ending I could ever hope to see.

I could do worse. brunette has a completely pointless scene where she is topless in front of the mirror is a bonus. :) The camera work is stylish and the discordant guitar riffage of Mr.Ry Cooder is superb, the pace is slow but not sluggish and you can almost feel the heat and dust. This film is good but not great. Er... that's it. a brothel, for example, is classic Hill stuff in terms of its staging, unapologetic brutality and superb cutting.That the film is a remake of a remake is of no consequence to me. It is still a rousing, spare piece of masculine entertainment with a whiff of Peckinpah, a dash of Kurosawa, and a splatter of Corbucci.That ain't no bad thing. talky segments, it feels painfully stiff. The acting style is flat, and everybody delivers their lines with the same sour expression, which Hill seems quite fond of considering how many facial close ups he uses.In the end, the movie has a little something to offer.

Worth renting from Blockbuster. of the girls and what they've been through and what they go through shows how unfortunate they were and even worse, I damn near almost started crying at the ending 'cause it made me feel so bad.  Christopher Young score well with the BGM of this flick to put the cherry on top.very wonderful movie with a conscience 10/10 like to empathize with a movie. If you let yourself have the same feelings as the characters in themovie have you might have strong emotions like: despair, feelingtrapped and injustice. You might even find, that choices you can't comprehend are suddenlyvery logical. For peoples that don't let their feelings participate in watching themovie. I imagine this movie is less appealing. 	6.9	0
2 Days in the Valley (1996)	and picturesque.  I know I'm using a lot of superlatives to describe this movie, but it's so darn good and so few people went to see it and I hope more people do.  So I urge anyone who hasn't to check out this underrated gem!  You won't be disappointed!  My score:  8 (out of 10) true ensemble cast, with no one -- with the possible exception of Spader, having a lead role. The story is full of twists, surprises and turnabouts enough to flesh out two or three movies. You can tell that all of these fine actors are enjoying playing the quirky characters we are presented with to make this a true fun romp. that decides its time to shoot a foursome at the golf course next to his home.  How these characters are brought together through the planning of an Olympic star (well, almost a star)who is ready to have her ex knocked off for the will is amusing, well acted, and one of the best films I've seen in some time. Two Days in the Valley and never once thought about PF, because I enjoyed it and accepted it as just another variation on a theme that was worth watching....and I'll more than likely watch it again....for its entertainment value.  The characters were believable in a many-threaded plot that finally knitted together in a way that did not seem contrived. is an aging hit man and provider of comic relief. Jeff Daniels is a burnt out detective and Eric Stoltz is a detective wannabe.Rounding out the cast is Paul Mazursky, Peter Horton, Marsha Mason, and small parts for Keith Carradine and Louise Fletcher. You will probably want to invite friends over and watch this thing again. It is worth it. 	6.5	0
Curdled (1996)	"comedies, like Parents and I, Madman. Jones (her solo dance is a knockout) and Baldwin are both dead-on, and the director and editor never miss a beat. This is one of the best films of the 90s. (by the way, did anyone notice that this film opened about the same time as Headless Body in Topless Bar? quite a coincidence.) Robert Rodriguez. Apparently this exists in the same universe that ""From Dusk to Dawn"" does, plus features Billy Baldwin as a killer. That is pretty sweet.I would need to see this a second time to really get a handle on it, but I think I was pleasantly surprised and hope this film somehow makes a resurgence on people's to-see lists. of extras (including the original short film) for a movie that is apparently so reviled. The worst thing I can say about ""Curdled"" is that Braddock didn't go on to make another film and Jones went on to do a freakin ""Children of the Corn"" sequel. Recommend to all fans of serial killer movies and dark comedies. My rating: 10/10 William Baldwin plays the killer.  Angela Jones' character is mesmerized by murder scenes and gets a job with a company that cleans up after murders.  She soon comes in contact with the murderer on the job site and the suspense begins to build.  Great performance by Angela Jones and a brilliant story and dialogue provided by Braddock. the casual way that the gore is treated, it may not be suitable for everyone.  However, I enjoyed it b\c of it's pure creativity and of course, wonderful acting by the two main leads. A give it a strong 8/10 stars for having the courage to be different.  That is my story and I am sticking to it. "	5.9	0
Ed's Next Move (1996)	"the folk music scene. While the script could have been sharper the film more than makes up for it with the subtle but sensual sexuality of Callie Thorne, the at times stunning photography of Peter Nelson, and the really quite amazing soundtrack. Anyone looking for a film with heart will not go wrong giving this little known gem a view. Next Move does a wonderful job showing us a realistic beginning of a new relationship, and that makes this story so enjoyable and satisfying.  This movie understands the hoops any nice guy has to go through, and is a wonderful cathartic experience for anyone who has attempted to ask a girl out and retreated before even asking the question. and has a nice naive quality.  The lead actress, who looks like Annabelle Sciorra's (sp?) relative, is also very likable and has a  nice chemistry with Ross.  I was very surprised at how enjoyable this film was.  There is not a whole lot to the film, but it is very emotionally rewarding and worth checking out. for a young man moving to a big city. The awkwardness for a regular guy in finding that special someone, asking her out, and then the dating. It's hard not to like Ed. I also enjoyed the folksy music by ""Ed's redeeming quality band"". I especially enjoyed the song ""more bad times"". This movie was fun and I liked it. and spends most of the film's run time trying to get together with her. ""ENM"" is a modest but likeable little romantic comedy sans titillators about the usual Manhattan ""flat rats"" with more practical dating single issues in lieu of romance. Even tempered but only slightly original, ""ENM"" makes for an easy going, pleasant watch for romcom junkies only. (C+) "	6.4	0
Extreme Measures (1996)	"Awfully Big Adventure will be well aware of this.  And Gene Hackman is as excellent as ever.  A word for Elizabeth Hurley, who produced the film, and I think it was her first: a damn good job she did, despite some unsavoury sniping in the British press about her.  I'd give it an 8 out of 10 a job Hugh Grant would do in a role much more serious than we usually see, but...surprise!  He is thoroughly convincing as a young surgeon troubled by some things that don't add up in the Emergency Room, troubled enough to investigate further, risking his career and ultimately his life to find out what is going on.Definitely worth a look! as was the entire cast. the movie, where I could not decide whether ""the bad guy"" really was such a bad guy. I think that this sounds very confusing, but watch the movie and decide for yourself. ""The bad guy's"" motives aren't bad at all, it is just the way he does it! A thrilling, although a bit slow movie at times. I voted 7/10. Hugh Grant is very convincing and unaffected in one of his most serious roles, and the ending is not as cut-and-dried as you might expect it to be. But the most memorable moment, for me at least, occurs early on, when a very ill and frightened man, barely able to speak, looks straight into Grant's eyes, pleading for help. (**1/2) "	6.1	0
Glimmer Man, The (1996)	"Asian holy man role, that for peace and harmony likes to beat the living crap out of bad guys. For a partner there is the wise cracking Keenen Wayans who perfectly compliments Seagal. And there are plenty of smaller role bad guys that meet their demise.

One would figure if you were going to pair him up with someone, make it another action hero or another martial artist.Either way, if you're a Segal, action movie fan this movie is a good way to kill a couple of hours.  If you're not into that, then skip this flick. career and is sorely missed in his latest films.  An action vehicle that played perfectly to his talents and probably the last of the finest when it comes to the Seagal collection with the exception of ""Exit Wounds"".  Although unappreciated at the box office, this is what made Seagal ""Seagal"" and belongs in any Seagal fans DVD collection. are good,and as brutal as usual for a Seagal flick.you won't really find much new here,but if you're a Seagal fan,or a fan of the genre,this should keep you satisfied for the most part.by now,with Steven Seagal,you know what you're getting,or at least you should know.i was entertained for around 90 minutes or so.for me,The Glimmer Man is a 7/10 Man is not a masterpiece by any means but it serves its purpose well as a tense action thriller. It tries hard to be more than it is, but its lack of originality is its biggest flaw but it gets top marks for trying. You can't take anything away with you afterwards, but you can enjoy yourself along the way. "	5.4	0
D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996)	could teach children and teenagers about life. The third installment of this series, directed more toward teenagers than anyone else, really shows how teamwork and positive thinking can overcome obstacles and help them grow. I have seen D3 many times and yet as I recently bought the DVD and watched it again, I couldn't help but cheer for the Ducks. from again. Oh well.In this film, it's almost a rehash of the first film. A team who cannot get it together, get a washed up hockey player who they hate to coach them and they love him...your basic family fun, Disney flick.All in all this was a great movie, but hopefully Disney realizes that we've had enough.*** out of **** wasn't as bad as everyone says. Like I said, it had a good plot and a little bit of everything. Drama, humor, action, romance. It was great. Covers all the fields that any person can appreciate! All I'm saying is that you shouldn't judge a movie based on it's prequels. Give this movie a try, believe me. It's pretty great. Orion was annoying too. Bad mistake for Bombay to leave. Like I was saying before the movie had a lack of hockey. Throughout the movie you only see them play three games. Here are the positive things to say. The pranks were funny. I especially liked the one with horse turd. Over all I give this movie ** of ****. Peter, and Karp. Although the movie recieves a huge lift when Dean Portman returns to the squad and helps them win the game against the varsity team, it does not have the same feeling of a camaraderie as the first two. This could have been a great movie, if certain changes were made. It is still an enjoyable family movie. 	5.4	0

Faye Dunaway contributes boozy hysterics as Hackman's daughter who has made the jump from ""poor white trash"" to southern belle. Not a great movie. But watch it for Hackman and you'll see screen acting at its best. me as long as the end result on film is good. This was a good movie, and I appreciated the fact that while Cayhall's character was softened over the course of it, there was no real redemption for the character. He played his part in the children's deaths, and he paid the price for it. Overall, this is pretty good. us to see the quiet determination with which he works. (The camera is a good replacement for the interior monologue of fiction!)I also liked the flash-backs which help him to comprehend just where his father came from and why suicide might have been a response. This film is timely today in lieu of the polarization of American politics. Scary stuff! screen. Building up a romance between blue-eyed Mr. O'Donnell and brown-skinned Lela Rochon (as Nora Stark) seems like such an obvious way to improve the story (whether or not it was done in the John Grisham novel), you've got to wonder how on Earth they missed the obvious.***** The Chamber (10/11/96) James Foley ~ Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman, Faye Dunaway "	6.0	0

But in point of fact Knotts is just a bad planner.The Apple Dumpling Gang spawned a sequel in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again where Knotts and Conway have even more hysterical misadventures.

Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955)	"Ebsen who captured my imagination and have kept me dreamin' for nearly half a century.  Sure there were some Hollywood inaccuracies but the flavor, feeling and freedom of the eastern woodlands and the early frontiersmen were portrayed good enough to make me, and a lot of others, life-long Crockett admirers.  ""Be sure you are right then go ahead."" as a Congressman from Tennessee comprises the middle part which sets up the third and exciting finale as Crockett and friends battle the Mexican army in the famous battle at the Alamo. The Appalachians of North Carolina where the Creek War skirmishes were filmed show beautiful mountain vistas and add realism to this fine film story of an American legend. childish, and a mediocre production at best.Perhaps that's all true, but it would miss the most important point. Seldom has any TV production cause so many young people to love a couple of screen characters so deeply, and with such spontaneous joy. In this regard it is a Classic and holds a special place in the history of television art. moments away was the best way they could have done it. The movie even had some historic truths which other movies about the Alamo lacked such as the attack before dawn. It seemed longer when I was a kid and I know they have cut some; yea even important scenes, which I wish they would restore to DVD or VHS. a 3 week period in 1956 and have seen it so often I can almost recite the dialogue.  Fess Parker has been and always will be Davy Crockett, and even though George Russell was a ficticious character, he also did a super job.

Why not Tony & Tia?I could rhapsodize for paragraphs about both ""With Mountain"" films, and I may still do so when I get my special edition DVDs. In the meantime, here's hoping that a whole new generation of kids will discover ""Witch Mountain"" for themselves.  I can now share some of my childhood with my own kids.  No big surprise, but my older daughter (7) loves it.  My younger daughter (2) thought some parts were ""scary daddy""; the broom/jail scene was well done! Highly recommend it as a family film for folks that want a nice movie to watch with their kids. 5th grader, I knew what it was to be outside the norm, and I wanted to have the same powers that Tia did, so I guess that's saying something!I too place this movie with Parent Trap, Candleshoe, and Freaky Friday. Good movies that I don't have to worry about my child ""catching"" wrong words from!  **** out of 5. has the usual hi jinks one expects in a ""chase"" film. I enjoyed it then and liked it just as much after a recent viewing on cable.This movie also illustrates how one doesn't need bad language or crude behavior/jokes to appeal to kids.

Herbie Rides Again (1974)	"spunky. Keenan Wynn is almost perfect in his role as the over-the-top Disney villain. OK - the flashbacks to Herbie's racing career are too long. But the film is strong enough to succeed despite that setback. This film is classic early Disney - full of impossible fantasy and magical inventions. If you have children - this film is a must. is in charge the whole time and has maybe lost a touch of the `lovable little guy' appeal that he had in The Love Bug.Overall kids will love it, and it isn't a bad Herbie movie  it's just not as good as the first couple.  But really  you know what to expect and it delivers nothing more. it was made in the mid sixties. I guess it was Stephanie Powers's character's sense of style and the heavy use of sets and rear projection.The Volkswagon beatle has always had a persona to it and the Herbie movies highlight it.""The Love Bug"" and ""Herbie Rides Again"" are great examples of the child like spirit of Disney at their best. made me pay attention when I was a little whipper-snapper!Disney should have stopped this series at this point.  The next film, ""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo,"" was pedestrian, and only saving grace was that it, A) features Don Knotts, and B) is 1,000 times better than ""Herbie Goes Bananas,"" the only good thing about which is the whacky title.   The funniest part in the movie was when Herbie and all of his volkswagen friends chased Alonso Hawke down the streets of San Francisco.  That part is hilarious and priceless. Children and adults will love this movie and the other Herbie movies too. Go out and buy all of the Herbie movies.  You won't regret it. "	5.6	0
Old Yeller (1957)	"does not know the story of ""Old Yeller"", be warned that you may shed tears after seeing what many consider to be one of the most heartbreaking scenes in movie history. But that scene only makes you love this movie even more as through tragedy comes hope and learning experiences. Don't miss one of the greatest classics of all time. taking responsibility, not sneaking drinks and experimenting with sex.  Also, the ""messages"" were woven nicely into the script, not tacked on and rammed over your head.  It also helped that they had actors, rather than ""stars"".  This is really what family filmmaking (a term I generally hate) should be:  Something that kids and adults can appreciate.  Superb performances all around, a very touching (especially for dog lovers, it might even be to painful for some i.e. my wife) with a very heart-wrenching ending. They don't make them like this any more. If you enjoyed Old Yeller, may I recommend you give The Yearling a try.  Which is even better (if possible) than Old Yeller. lazy settler who doesn't do a thing. Even Chuck Connors has a fine cameo as the real owner of Old Yeller who gives the dog up to please a child.Old Yeller still has the power to make me cry, and I've seen it at least 50 times. It's sentimental and pushes all the right buttons, but I still love it. Travis character toward the little girl. I don't remember even noticing that as a child.

A truly good family film, much better than the book, and one really worth viewing. it is set in the early 1900's, its message is still very applicable in the modern world.I was blown away by the genuine power of Hayley Mill's performance.The supporting cast is also excellent,especially Karl Malden and Agnes Moorehead.If you want to see a nearly flawless and absolutely charming fim,than this is the one to see.Far and away Hayley's best performance. is a positive attribute, not an indictment. Cheezy? How about ""touching"" instead? The cast, the performances, the setting, and most of all, the message are right on. The film makes me laugh and cry every time I view it. How could you possibly ask for more? Guess I'm just a soft touch. Highly recommended for all but the terminally cynical. way of life.  I come from a school of thought where sunny is ridiculed and message movies are tedious, so the lead is an obvious target of disdain. Stay with Pollyanna awhile and watch her reform all the bitter, crusty malcontents on the planet into fans with a straightforward logic and uncanny point of view.  A true heroine. wonderful job in recreating that era before World War I in small town America, very much like The Music Man. Pollyanna is what they mean by fine family entertainment, as good now as it was when I first saw it in theaters in 1960.In fact it might just make one curious enough to check out the Mary Pickford silent version.

Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)	of trouble, they set out on their adventure home.Along the way they encounter many unexpected surprises but their determination and love for their owners helps them in finding their way. For me, this was an unforgettable story of love, courage and devotion that will inspire everyone who watches it. A must see for animal lovers! I give it a 10! straight as the mature Golden Retriever.The only somewhat-bothersome character is the 13-year-old boy who is impatient and pouty at times, but he gets out that after awhile.The scenery is nice, too, with photographers doing a fine job capturing the beauty of California's Sierra mountain range. All in all, a very nice movie and highly-recommended for one of those 'family nights.' both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever.  This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults.  Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry!  (happy tears!) personalities: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) He's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one. sap! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case.

Swiss Family Robinson (1960)	alone the face-off scene with the hyenas!  Wrestling an anaconda chest-deep in a mosquito and leech-infested swamp is probably not a role most actors dream of.  James MacArthur was told by the snake's handler to just dunk the snake's head under water when it started to constrict him; apparently it worked, as he lived to tell the tale! To me this film is an exception to the less-weighty fare that Disney was wont to produce over the years.  I like Disney flicks, but this is one I can go back and watch when I want to get lost in an idyllic setting (with beautiful soundtrack music to establish the mood).  You've gotta love those coconut bombs! This is a timeless classic, watch it a couple of times a year and it is just as entertaining the second time as the first. Wish Disney would re-release this film to theatres so you could see it on a big wide screen, preferably Imax. Movies just do not get any better than this one. Perfect film for family viewing. DVD.  It's great! The extras are wonderful and the movie is even better.  I love Disney movies, but some of the older live-action movies get annoying to me after awhile.  This one doesn't.  I love to imagine myself on that island with all the animals and fighting pirates.  It's great.  I definitely recommend it! Kirk and JAMES MacARTHUR, who excels as the oldest son.There's some rough going when the pirates invade, but it's all done in true Disney style and you know there's going to be a happy ending.Summing up: The kind of film the whole family can enjoy. A lot more visually appealing than the old B&W version filmed on RKO sound stages. 	7.2	0
That Darn Cat! (1965)	just enough menace to make the kidnapped woman's predicament a little scary. I also loved the wacky next-door neighbors (Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest), Hayley's surfer-boyfriend named Canoe (Tom Lowell), and befuddled Ed Wynn as a jewelry salesman. Simply put, a wonderful modern-day caper for parents and kids which puts the remake with Christina Ricci to shame. ***1/2 from **** film, anyhow?  Fantastic acting?  Great plot? Beautiful cinematography?  Superb directing?  Babes?  Well, you can't say it had any of those things.  But it DID set out to do what it attempted to do, which was:  make people laugh.  A lot. And that makes it, in my opinion, a pretty darn good movie. the mix of comedy and real malice towards their captive. The cat was a funny part, i remember them trying to 'paw print' him and them winding up plastering poor Dean Jones head to foot w/ the cat's inky paw prints.Say what you will, Disney doesn't make things like this anymore and that is our loss.*** outta **** it's fun. The Riddler(Batman), to Roddy McDowell, to Uncle Charlie(My Three Sons). And of course, Dean Jones and Haley Mills. It's one of those timeless, goofy Disney comedy classics that stands in a kitsch class of it's own! Ya gotta see it again!YMMV if you're a tweener at this point (too mature for it's cornball silliness, and too young to be nostalgic!)  I also like the actress who plays the hostage - she *looks* like an older woman who might actually work at a bank - not like a Hollywood glamour girl! I haven't seen the 1997(?) remake, but I suspect it isn't as good as the original.  All in all, an enjoyable movie for a Saturday night at home! 	6.7	0

Mr Goff died March 3, 1993 at his home in Palm Springs at the age of 81.Corfman probably true if you study his character of Ned Land. But in parallel, Douglas makes his character funny and likeable. Then, Paul Lukas and especially Peter Lorre are outstanding.No matter that the movie was launched in 1954, the special effects aren't antiquated. Thanks to them, the movie could keep a certain charm and nowadays, it lets itself watch with pleasure. the United States Navy launched it's first atomic submarine.

Nonetheless, Verne's speculations on power do make a good symbolic match with the notion of atomic energy, birthing a very credible meditation on the nineteenth century in the light of its successor. The somber and frighteningly beautiful finale causes us to wonder just at what point before 1900 this or that fateful corner was turned. most interesting and visually spectacular films ever made, whereas the book contained a great deal of unfilmable ichthyology that was more of an excursus into the expertise of Jules Verne than any dramatic device.

Cool Runnings (1993)	general silliness, but there is also good drama and fine performances.  John Candy showed he could deliver an emotional performance instead of just schtick.

The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks. uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you. When things seem impossible, just remember that there's a Jamaican bobsled team. are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that's worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichés are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film, and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm. take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair, get the phone on divert, and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching. 	6.9	0
Angels in the Outfield (1994)	George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins believing in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and Roger and J.P. find something to believe in. Glover in particular gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing a washed-up pitcher, also does well, despite clearly having ZERO idea of how to pitch out of the windup! the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay. to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world.As a young adult the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive, however I will give credit to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover who all did a fantastic job. the characters even though we know exactly what's going to happen to them.To be sure, there are many better films out there, and adults would almost certainly want to spend their time watching one with a bit more maturity. But for those looking for a movie they can enjoy along with their children, they will find Angels worth their time. also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time. It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best. A must see. I highly recommend.8/10 	6.1	0
Cinderella (1950)	"hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a ""Dream Come True."" work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal. scenes include the ""Nightingale"" number, with Cinderella's reflection in the soap bubbles, the evil sisters tearing her dress to shreds, her arrival at the ball, and the trying-on of the slipper. Add to that some great numbers like ""Bibbodi Bobbodi Boo"", and the mice's ""work song"". A wonderful movie, that never loses its magic, no matter how old you are. interest.  The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers.  It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them.  Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century. sequence of the fairy godmother is one of the best of all Disney films (what a dream the transformation of the dress) and the ball episode is exciting and fascinating in both drawing (note the use of the shadows at a time when computer coloring was far away), dialogue and music (the Cinderella Waltz ""So this is love"" is enchanting).

Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968)	sequence in Dumbo; inspired, creative and unforgettable. During the storm, pages from the book blow away as the wind rises, rain washes text down the page and away into a stream, etc. Everyone should love this adaptation; Disney soon cranked Pooh out as a series, and it got tedious and sloppy.  But this early effort is a real masterpiece. as a whole (a couple of images from it stayed with me through the years), and that gives it the edge to appeal to older audiences.  While I would usually recommend The Many Adventures, if one just wants to see part of the film, this is the one to see.  A+ (as much for quality as for nostalgia) for Animated Short and it's easy to see why: everything clicks.  The voice casting is great, the design is superb, animation is top-notch and the source material is accorded with the respect and affection it merits. By all means, find this and watch it if you can.  As of this writing, it is in-print.  Most joyously recommended. film and it made me sing along and laugh.If you like Winnie The Pooh I would recommend this one! because it's full of fun adventures for the whole family to enjoy. It may be an older movie but it is a great one! Actually I prefer the older Winnie The Pooh movies,but I like all the Winnie The Pooh movies! score is also memorable, too. What didn't satisfy me was that it didn't include the Winnie the Pooh theme song. Does anyone know why? Anyway, in conclusion, Walt Disney died during the production of this short and the Academy Award was given posthumous. So see it for him if you haven't already, because I'm very sure he would've liked it. 	8.0	1
Sword in the Stone, The (1963)	"Era, when ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"" or especially ""Bambi"" set the utmost high standards of perfectionism, but quite better than in ""Hercules"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Rescuers down under"". 7 of 10 stars for ""The Sword in the Stone""! It is not the best of all Disney films, but quite better and deeper than the most of the modern CGI movies! of T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King. Made for the kids, Disney does it again taking a classic story and adding fictional animal characters that can talk. Still, Disney remains loyal to the story by keeping many of the characters in the story including Kay, Sr. Pellinoire, and Sir Ector.Worth watching twice with the family. An animated classic take forever because there are so many hilarious moments.The songs are clever and enjoyable, such as ""The Sword in the Stone"", ""That's what makes the world go round"" and especially ""Higitus Figitus"", my personal favorite.I like this movie and I've gotta say that humor is, without a doubt, the strongest attribute of this movie.This should definitely be on Top 250. agreed that the later novel has disfigured the first, so that we may be thankful for the Disney version!Though it does not quite follow the book (this is hardly possible, at times) it is a very good version as animated movies go. Not tedious, though of an age where children were meant to learn something from a movie...A collectors item! (one may try to look to the Jungle Book or Winnie the Pooh for that, or the underrated Aristocats), however I sometimes come back to this film in my mind. It has a catchy attitude that made being in the 'dark ages' as fun as possible- Archamedes in particular is maybe one of the great side-characters in any Disney film.Alakazam! "	7.2	0
So Dear to My Heart (1949)	"the theater will love the feeling of being taken back to a time when simple things were the important things in life. I hope you enjoy it as much as our family.Like Song of the South, it is not currently out on DVD in the United States, but fortunately I bought a laser-disc copy of the film several years ago. in real life, then I'd probably meet and work with them. This movie is not as well-known as other Disney films, probably because of its simple story, but don't miss it. With a lot of pros I've mentioned above, it doesn't seem dated. I love it as much as ""Song of the South"" and rate it **** out of ****. of ""Song of the South"" doesn't completely succeed because, although the same kids--Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten--are present, there's no Uncle Remus or any memorable songs beyond ""Lavender Blue"" (which, granted, is a dilly). Still, the film is meticulously produced and overwhelmingly heartfelt. A nice addition to the Disney catalogue, and rather touching in its old-fashioned way. *** from **** uncle. The animation is quite good, but the live action takes up most of the screen time. There are some memorable songs, although the Oscar nominated tune ""Lavender Blue"" is actually rather disappointing. So Dear To My Heart is worth watching, just so long as you remember that it was made in a time when the world was more innocent. bring back memories! Quite honestly, I'm surprised the ""offend no-one"" attitude of Disney today hasn't got to the religious content of this film, which is refreshing and makes me thankful that they at least hold SOME things sacred (unlike digitally removing Pecos Bill's cigarette or editing out the Hatfields and McCoys scene from Make Mine Music). I love this film. "	7.1	0
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)	started playing the part of Hollywood bean-counter and worrying about 'Waterworld's' budget. But you know what I like about both these movies? No CGI. I am sick and tired of CGI movies. Popping the deluxe 'Robin Hood' DVD into the old player is a refreshing treat and a thumb in the eye of digital junk like 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' well have got an English actor instead of an American one, but somehow, I don't think Costner could have been bettered. He makes an excellent Robin Hood. Alan Rickman is brilliant as the hilarious Sherrif of Nottingham ('Shut up you TWIT!')It's great fun, and one of those film to watch with your feet up and a big bar of chocolate..... Mastrantonio give their all, creating a truly emotional and powerful film.  I don't understand why the ratings are so low.The ending is just beautiful.  I boo at the sheriff, cheer for Robin, and cry during Robin and Marian's post-sword fight embrace every time, and you will too if you ignore the cynics and give this adventure a chance.9/10 Absolutely love it!!! Could watch it again and again great action sequences including the battle against the hired Celts and Nottingham's soldiers and the final confrontation at the climax of the film.Finally, don't be put off by Costner's lack of an English dialect.  It doesn't hurt the film at all, and is just something critics were instantly attracted to, as it is their job to find faults.Highly recommended. 	6.9	0
Mary Poppins (1964)	"but they can register the message here of what is truly important in life. Poppins has the answers. It is better we don't analyze who she is  and or course she never explains anything. The Banks family is just glad she was there for a while, and we should be glad that Walt Disney left us with this masterpiece. are a few drawbacks: The film's a little over-long, especially in the final third where Mary's but an afterthought in all the plot resolution. In addition, Van Dyke was an excellent choice for his singing and dancing (and popularity), but his cockney accent does grate after a while.But all in all, this is a tour de force for all involved! won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.With songs both silly and sublime, seamless intermeshing of live performers and animation as only the Disney studio, at that time, was capable of, and the undeniable magnetism of Andrews and Van Dyke, it is nearly impossible NOT to like ""Mary Poppins""! so I could get the Mary Poppins prize inside, to gathering on weekends with cousins to listen to the soundtrack and try to dance like Bert. I've been to London many times since then, but funny enough, as much as the great city has to offer, I've never been able to find that magical place I saw 40 years ago. those gorgeous songs(each one of them great). The animation part is brilliant, takes a genius to make that and coordinate those dancing penguins with the Bert character.And I think that all the words that I could possibly say about this film are over, except tat this film is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Mary Poppins, practically perfectly in every way! A MUST SEE FILM!! "	7.8	1
Dumbo (1941)	"(the train song), Pink Elephants, When I see an elephant fly and Baby Mine.10/10. Timothy Q Mouse is a great character, the animation is so concise and perfect, great songs, the message that if you believe you can overcome your handicaps you will so inspiring and beautiful, and the movie so short and sweet it will forever retain its appeal. that it is an attempt to revise that stereotype into something positive and sympathetic.  The songs and score are flawless, and the show-stopping, nightmarish pink elephant sequence keeps things from getting too artistically conservative--and, just like the rest of the film, it still thrills us no matter how many times we have seen it.  10 out of 10. can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful ""Baby Mine"" . The pink elephants scene is a classic. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best on a scale of one to ten...10  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve. Edwards, ""Ukelele Ike"" and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black --- I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it's a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time. It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability. "	7.3	0
Pete's Dragon (1977)	special effects are utterly dreadful. Kids will find a lot to like in Pete's Dragon as long as they can sit still for over 2 hours, and adults too will find pleasures along the way. It's certainly one of the better live-action offerings to come from the Disney studio at a time when their output was quite indifferent in quality. up being overrated and turn out to be disappointing because we create too much expectations on them, while a not so known and valued movie I may not expect that much from it but turns out to be a pleasant surprise. That only makes me respect and admire these less valued movies even more.This should definitely be on Top 250. the movie, you'll find yourself spontaneously singing the choruses the next day). The dancing is the most difficult to digest, as it is often stiff and pointless. That's okay, though, as the story and the acting more than make up for it. When all is said and done, Pete's Dragon is everything a kids movie should be: educating and entertaining. all just really, really good performances of well written songs.It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome.I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars. , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable. 	6.4	0
Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971)	also great and imaginative.This is certainly an enjoyable film on many counts, and should be remembered just as so many of the other Disney classics. It should also be seen in the recently restored version, which runs over two hours. The story is more fluent in that version, and the songs are intact, for the most part. A great movie. was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.An often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face! and enjoyment to an already delightful movie. The movie is well worth watching, and suitable for any child. Even today's children will find delight in the cartoon/human relations and the spectacular ending sequence were empty suits of armor are brought to life to fight for the good guys. I consider this movie a timeless classic that shouldn't be passed up. hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me. the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time. 	7.1	0
Alice in Wonderland (1951)	"Disney creating an entertaining look at a child's world. I think it is because of the Jungle Book that this is not as popular as some of the Disney Classics but you can't help but smile when you watch the Queen of hearts and the Mad Hatter being their own creative self's in the wonder of this amazingly clever gem novels (and plenty of rumors that he wasn't on any drugs at all), but there are certainly some things in the books and in the movie that could have only been conjured up by the most, um, eccentric of imaginations. We may never know for sure, but at least we have some wonderful entertainment. Read the books to your kids. Beaumont) is lovely and funny, the supporting characters appropriately manic, and the quiet moments gently even out the craziness (as with the Tulgey Wood/""Very Good Advice"" sequence). Disney certainly runs hot (""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"") and cold (""The Sword and the Stone""), but this fantastic journey into nonsense, from a practically-unfilmable book, is endlessly interesting from a visual standpoint. ***1/2 from **** the hippy culture of psychedelia, ALICE enjoyed a welcome theatrical return engagement in the '60s and has become more respected in recent years (an American-made British fantasy popular even in the U.K.) as one of the studio's finest efforts.Ironically, one of its most delightful characters--the doorknob--never appeared in the book but was applauded everywhere as an inspired bit of business. the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well. "	7.4	0
Fox and the Hound, The (1981)	"just lovely. Plus there are some fun jokes, I loved seeing Chief constantly chasing after Tod and then Slade runs over to Tweed's house to scream about the fox but she just kicks his butt and tells him to get off her property. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend you see it if you get the chance.10/10 what it had, a heart of gold, but also for what it lacked, a traditional formula. If you're looking for a story with a difference and a bittersweet flavor, this is the movie for you! It is nice, quiet, yet provocative and emotional. To sum it up, it is good clean fun with a touch of heartache, a true drama! and unlike the vast library of previous Disney inventions, as stated before, it lacks the happy ending. The proverbial feel good formula that is the frame work for all Disney movies. It's because of it's bittersweet delivery and surprising realism, that it's become a lifeline to my childhood that I will carry with me for as long as I live. he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it? love interest, and the villain, this film really touched me, because I wanted to see their friendship go on.  And although it did go on in some form, there is always that feeling of ""he doesn't belong"" being uttered by many of the other characters.  Why?  Well, this film asks children and adults alike, that very question. "	7.3	0
Freeway (1996)	"was hoping for a nicer twist, this film is your answer. I also suggest that if you couldn't get enough of Freeway that you try to get your hands on the very rare Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. See how Bright delicately transforms yet another dark fairy tale (Hansel and Gretel) into a modern masterpiece.Grade: ***** out of ***** good girl roles she seems stuck in now. This movie is funnier than you can possibly imagine, as things keep happening that just blow you away or shock the pants off you and no main character is what they seem to be at first. Definitely unpredictable, this dark comedy is a rare lost gem I was glad to find again. and enforcer of her own brand of justice to a particularly malevolent form of evil visited on by Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) and an uncaring and unbelieving law enforcement system. It's really a small classic and should be viewed without any predjudice of youth crime. It then becomes an eloquent statement for better and more rational treatment of young offenders. new respect for Reese and glad to know she isn't all about fluff movies catering to woman (i.e., ""Sweet Home Alabama""). I hope Reese digs into the grittier side of life again and does another movie of the ""Freeway"" caliber and leave her mantle of ""the next Meg Ryan"" at home!Way to go Reese, this movie is definitely worth owning! Witherspoon attacks her role full force and is just astounding.  Sutherland is equally good as the wolf (Wolveton--get it?) and the supporting cast is full of talented actors (Amanda Plummer, Michael T. Weiss, Dan Hedaya) all doing great.An undiscovered little gem.  But be warned--the violence and language is more than a little extreme.  NOT for the squeamish. "	6.9	0
Sound of Music, The (1965)	"thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you. scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? ""The Sound of Music"" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :) not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life. could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled. ""Singin' In the Rain"" is the only other contender to the title of ""The greatest movie ever made"". Whatever its flaws, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10 all ages. A Happy family film with no sex, violence or bad language. The young actors playing the roles of the von Trapp children are amazing and Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime as Maria, a young Nun who becomes a cheerful governess.This is definately a family movie to be watched together on a Sunday Afternoon!!

Die Hard (1988)	"of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A scene this movie 30 or 40 times already, and I know he's going to do it again the next time.This is a great film, and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point, and more importantly, it's a fun movie to watch, no matter how many times you see it. handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10 the former are good for a few laughs, and the latter is a very minor complaint.Otherwise, ""Die Hard"" is pretty much flawless. Bruce Willis, John McTiernan, Alan Rickman -- their finest hour (maybe you could make a case for Rickman's loftier work, but he's dead solid perfect here). A movie I have seen more than any other but for ""Casablanca."" "	8.2	1
Lawnmower Man, The (1992)	"has problems, it's not very fast paced, but is terribly engaging and Fahey is superb in the lead. The writing isn't great, but is passable, and the computer effects, though far from the center of the story, are excellent.If you haven't seen it yet, or have only seen the normal version, it is well worth the rental, or even purchase. they never dominate the movie. We might say that the movie deals with the dangers of people relying too much on technology, and also the dangers of militarism, but even aside from that, this is a movie worth seeing. Check it out.Oh, and I think that we can all agree that the sequel needs to be avoided at all costs. computer animation weren't the same back then as they are today.  Most older movies have that look when compared to today's special effects.  I always take that into account when watching older movies.  I enjoyed Lawnmower Man then, now and I will the next time I watch it.  I will keep it in my DVD collection. the hopes and dreams of a brilliant scientists, and the manipulation of a militaristic government. You get to see a great example of ""power corrupting"" a human being.I've seen this film a lot, from 15 to 25 years old, and the last scene of the movie never fails to give me shivers.But please, please, please don't watch the sequel. Really. forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clichéd story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way. "	5.4	0
Unhook the Stars (1996)	"even character study which builds enough interest in the Rowlands character to make it not too difficult to overlook her supporting cast who play obvious stereotypes, ""Unhook..."" is a flick with no punchline which plays like a meal with no dessert. The entertainment is in the ride, not the destination. A good slice of mature life flick worth a look. it used to be anymore!The acting was very good,especially Marisa Tomei was great as Monica Warren,the little boy's mom! Also I very much liked Gerard Depardieu as the truck-driver,but then again, he is always funny.

First rate. who makes a difference in Rowland's life -we never know how much. I wish more had been made of the relationship between Rowland and her daughter. It never becomes clear what their problem really is, and nothing is really resolved. Another exit to the airport ending leaving the viewer with many questions unanswered -very annoying, but overall a good film. Cassavettes(the late auteur John's prodigy), who co-wrote the well-written scrip with Helen Cladwell.

Michelle Pfeiffer should have received another Oscar nomination for her fearless portrayal of Rose Cook Lewis, the character modeled after Shakespeare's evil Regan from ""King Lear.""  While all of the performances are solid, they seem somehow timid next to Pfeiffer, who once again proves that she is most definitely not just another pretty face. know better than to put a hopelessly senile person on the witness stand.  The fine cast does pretty well, especially Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer, although as usual Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely adequate as the youngest sister.  Maybe watching this on a stormy Sunday night helped put me in the mood, but I rather enjoyed this one. I loved the way her character slowly changed through the movie and Lange can evoke so much emotion in the viewer with something as small as a hand gesture. Pfieffer is strong as well although the story mainly revolves around Ginny and I don't really see why Pfieffer gets first billing here. I strongly recommend the film, espeically on dvd. Smiley(, screenplay (Laura Jones), and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that, in my younger days, I wouldn't have read a book written by a woman. I didn't focus on this fact until years later.If you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. Maybe you are ready for it. but I think all the performances were outstanding, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity.  Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool.  I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again! "	6.0	0

Surviving Picasso (1996)	use much of his work in the film. I see the film as a well made, excellently acted, but partial (in both senses of the word) portrait of the artist. Its real focus is the women in his life, especially Francoise Gilot, and on the two-way exploitative nature of the relationship between a man of this kind and his mistresses/wives. an oddity; but how can one expect a man like Picasso to behave like a common man, when he was not one? Anthony Hopkins undergoes a complete transformation, and becomes the man Picasso, this only coming as further proof that a great artist can only be understood by another great artist, and the rest of us are just lucky spectators. Anthony Hopkins becomes the man Picasso. Natascha McElhone, Julianne Moore and Susanna Harker tell us the truth. Well paced, finely directed, this movie tells a riveting story. It is very, very good.It is perhaps worthy of note that many of the negative reviews of this movie are written by men. Picasso was not just difficult; he was a Difficult Man. and even did desperate things to show him how much they loved him. Yet, he didn't seem to appreciate any of their efforts.I was totally drawn into this film and think one needs to give it a chance. It's a thinking person's film. The character development is complex, but you begin to have sympathy for the victims of this madman. Las Vegas.  One half of it portrays a happy woman, the other half is tinged with sadness.  I now know the story behind this painting, making it all the more memorable.  Like the first reviewer, I'm not a big fan of Picasso, but knowing what lies behind some of his paintings will add interest in the future. 	6.4	0
Love Is All There Is (1996)	"is astoundingly beautiful as the Juliet character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful--- and, considering her age at the time, even her dialect is pretty good. Recreating this classic tale with feuding Italian families in the catering business in New York results in great fun. See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud. they're just supposed to be dumb teenagers in love. In fact, the real gems of the movie are the parents, particularly Lanie Kazan's role, and the wacky psychich (Joe Bologna's real life wife) because they are just totally wacko people, so it turns out to be a totally wacky comedy. One that I sure enjoyed.I think it's worth a shot. to (over)protect their children. Angelina Jolie gives a totally charming performance, that resonates with one's romantic side (if one has that).  If you like the actress, you have to have this movie. A fun movie without any message other than, that love is all there is. If it was available on DVD I would buy it in a minute! ""Blame It On Rio"") Lainie Kazan was perfect as his wife, and Paul Sorvino is just a GREAT actor.  Didn't realize till later that this must also have been one of Angelina Jolie's first roles.As a participant/guest/victim of many Italian wedding extravaganzas, I loved it.  A New Yawk version of ""Blazing Saddles"".Four out of five stars from me! all. Being brought up in an old-fashioned Italian neighborhood, I was able to identify with so many of the ""grownups"" in my past.If you're really bummed, your checking account balance is in red, the IRS is after you, and your sinus headache is keeping you awake, find this film. It will cure all that and smooth out your hangnails, too! "	5.2	0
Beautiful Thing (1996)	DVD, so I can put my last VHS tape to rest, but disappointed that there were no cast interviews or extras at the end. Granted, the movie was made six years or so after the DVD came out, but you might think the film makers would find something of interest.So England what will be the next great gay movie ? into different social classes, although they do mix a little more than they used to. But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.Overall, a light-hearted look at life on a London council Estate with some great performances... one of my favourite films. on both a nostalgic and familiarity level.  This movie gets better with every viewing...and I'd love to see what happened to each of the characters in a sequal.This movie is, without a doubt, very personal to all gay men and women who came out during their youth and a favorite of all of my friends, both gay and straight. so that bad characters do good things and good characters do bad things. Nobody is perfect and nobody is all bad, which makes the film even more realistic. It's similar to the more recent Get Real, but Beautiful Thing is definitely better. This is without a doubt my favorite gay film. Only the British can make a film this good! context (very nicely detailed film-making) keeps those minor gripes minor.There have been so many cynical or clichéd gay dramas released during the last decade or two, especially in the US (gay film from elsewhere in the world often seems so much more fresh and lifelike) - in many ways this film was (and remains) a real breath of fresh air. 	7.6	1
Long Kiss Goodnight, The (1996)	"pieces that one can only see in an action film. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. Thus, there is formula here, but it is the Anti-Formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity pleasantly surprised when I bump into people who feel the same way too. People either love it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it at all.If you like action films this is a film to definitely try. You may not like it, but it certainly worth the effort to find outAnd as always, leave reality at the door. Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""!! rotation every 3 or 4 months. I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back.All you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves! Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him. It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.

Ghost and the Darkness, The (1996)	and of course allows the story to be told best. Surprising to see that the movie also had actors in it, that would later turn into big well known names such as Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson, in some good roles. Also Om Puri gives a nice performance.A perfectly fun and simple adventurous action movie. This is high quality entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ like a lion himself.Once this film starts, I can guarantee you that you won't be able to take a snack break, bathroom break, or even think about dozing off. It is that good. And remember this: You can see the preserved bodies of these two giant man-eaters at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois because this incredible story is TRUE. excruciation pain when they had to bite into the extremely thick and tough hides of their normal prey in order to kill and eat them. They turned to hunt kill and eat human beings only because their skin or hides weren't as tough and thus easier to penetrate and not cause the Tasvo Lions any terrible pains in doing so. lion attack scenes are not gruesome and the filmmakers did a nice job a having just the right amount of action and lulls. Neither is overdone. This film has never been given much due but I've never shown it to anyone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it.This movie scared me so much I stopped hunting lions. It's just not fun anymore. believe it. John Kani also gives a good performance, contained mostly in small moments that are so true they almost hurt. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the of the lion attacks and their passages through the grass. Again, no cgi effects could convey so much beauty and lurking menace. This movie is beautiful, intense, and dramatic; I highly recommend it. 	6.8	0
Looking for Richard (1996)	"on the edge of our seats as the film neared its climax. My one complaint? I wish they had then gone on to film their entire version of Richard III to offer as a companion piece. An excellent way to indulge yourself in an exciting, well-performed piece of movie-making, and actually come away having learned a little bit. Highly recommended! Shakespeare, and he instilled that appreciation in me. Unfortunately, everyone isn't as lucky. Boring classes turned them off, and that's all they'll ever experience of Shakespeare. They are missing so much. I hope all the English teachers out there who are less than comfortable with teaching Shakespeare will show this film to their classes to counteract any Shakespeare phobia-inducing incidents. Italian from New York City could play Richard the 3rd. ? Al Pacino is marvellous as he searches the stage and beyond for the true Richard the 3rd. Kevin Spacey, Winonna Ryder, and Alex Baldwin are just some who join him in the journey as he wonders the streets of New York and London for the true love of Shakespeare. Ryder sounded like she was ""speaking Shakespeare.""  I had similar problems with Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in Romeo + Juliet, especially compared to the smooth and natural performances of Pete Postlethwaite and Harold Perrineau.The movie is not for everyone.  But if you enjoy acting, if you enjoy Shakespeare, and/or you simply enjoy Pacino, this is a must-see. The cast pulls the play off with aplomb, and the interviewees make their points without becoming dry, didactic, or condescending.  But it's Pacino's show, and he shows not only his great acting talent, but why he's also a great director.  And again, this invites us into a celebration of art, rather than repels us by being a lesson. "	7.4	0
Trees Lounge (1996)	"brilliance and charm that trees lounge conveys. Tommy's character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy. It's in his anti-heroic attributes ie. selfishness and callousness, that make the film so human and believable. American releases as passionate and warm as Trees Lounge do not come around as often anymore, with only The Station Agent coming close. So enjoy. cast has gone on to do other known films. Carol Kane, Mark Boone Junior Steve Buscemi, Bronson Dudley, Anthony LaPaglia and Steve's brother Michael Buscemi star in this Minnie and Moskowitz type story. Seymour Cassell and Mimi Rogers add their touch of magic to this story as well. A deep story with deep characters, this is a movie worth watching. of the drinkers culture. Every actor in this movie hits just the right note especially Chloe Sevigny, who has never looked more fetching. One of those silly Baldwins even turns in a fine performance. Steve Buscemi wrote and directed this movie and I shall be rather intrested in any subsequent work he does in either field. 10 out of 10. a certain type of people(working-class and barflies) and how they live their lives.  While it may drag at times, there's enough truth and detail to keep you interested.  Buscemi also directs actors well; this is the film which convinced me Chloe Sevigny was for real.  I understand Buscemi is making another film; I look forward to it. mothers"", his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadn't even heard of It and It's been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort.

Proprietor, The (1996)	are the heart of this movie.While there are unnecessary sub-plots, even these diversions give the director, Ismael Merchant, an opportunity to cinematically present Paris at its most lovely.I consider this a very good movie with yet another brilliant and controlled performance by the incomparable Moreau. There are some very interesting character roles including Jean Pierre Aumont. The cinematography is lovely! did what I could to make it celebritous, stood and applauded, and Madame very shyly bowed to us.The film itself is best described as imperfect jewels - romantic, beautiful scenes and decors, and a capable cast. For some reason it doesn't completely come together as it should. I would still like a DVD version, for no other reason than posterity. and they then become friends becomes the universal message of this story. Throw in the reconcilation of a marriage gone bad, and the young couple overcoming their cultural differences, and the story comes full circle. The scenes of racial problems in Frances brought the issue to light. Few Americans see this side of France. I give the movie an eight. obviously trying to serve an American audience.  The French, in particular, have a way with invention that sidesteps stereotyping.  Older people don't appear as saints or fools.  Americans don't appear as total idiots.  Youth isn't always blunt and naive.  And life isn't telegraphed.  So an otherwise boring girl flick turns into something worth watching. too bad that we don't have better support for foreign films in this country, so that they get released here. We are missing out on some great movies and actors. This film is worth seeing. Just don't judge the rest of the movie based on Ms. Young's performance. I hope it comes to DVD in the US some time soon. 	5.6	0
Normal Life (1996)	"Perry's change almost believable - however his final change doesn't totally make sense. That said it's a pretty emotional ride that doesn't let you get bored at any point, is well acted and well scripted. All through the film you can't help but feel sad for Perry as he is henpecked, corrupted and ultimately tormented by Judd's childish alluring Pam. time she becomes a new woman.The characters are well drawn, the car chases quite exciting.  This change of mood spices up their sex lives clearly depicted in a series of bedroom scenes.The final sequences are dramatic and exciting so stay with the film to the end. The old saying that ""Crime does not pay"" is clearly delivered and understood. Pam's wild side.  He goes from cop to bank robber in a first successful, but then futile attempt to make things right, which only seems to excite Pam more.  Eventually their luck runs out, and the inevitable ensues.  The last 15 minutes of this film are the best part with some surprising twists right near the end. few details that are not explained (like what exactly is used to justify Perry's character's firing from his job.) Also, the movie is a bit too long, more noticeably in the first half of the movie - cutting fifteen or so minutes from the movie would have helped. But despite these faults, the movie is still well worth seeking out. C it was fashionable to love the underdog during the depression and feel compassion for them. Ashley Judd, again is a genuinely intelligent and gorgeous actress with an educational b.g. which is astonishing and may have influenced the director/writer to involve her in the astronomy which was a masterful quirky touch.The dialogue rings true and again Perry and her amaze.

Get on the Bus (1996)	"in this film.The dialogue is so flowing and casual in this film despite its topic matter, that you could listen to this film instead of watch it!  I can't recommend this film enough for fans of Spike Lee or fans of great dialogue.  As a Spike Lee worshipper, I rank this film in his top 5.  Potent. so he can show it to his future children; and an open-hearted elderly man who is going to the Million Man March simply because he wants to.""Get on the Bus"" is in my opinion, one of Spike Lee's best films.  Each of the characters are unique in one a way or another.A film that is not to be missed. Million Man March. Although many may not relate to Farrakhan and his beliefs, they will, however, be educated on issues of race, unity, and respect. Regardless of skin color or ethnic background, people can easily relate to the characters on-screen. If anything, Get On The Bus will teach anyone to have a deeper love and appreciation of our fellow man. powerful messages, I did feel a little disappointment - but as I write, instead of me whining for a better ending, my mind has traversed across millions of attitudes and set free many images that had been lodged in my simple mind.This may not sound like a riveting review - but you'll need to watch it - you'll be nourished. firmly believe that Spike Lee captured the central epic struggle within the black community and its overall effect on the American landscape as a whole.  I was happy to see that ALL aspects of the society were equally represented in this film without reinforcing dated stereotypes.  This is clearly Lee's greatest work. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE ONCE. "	6.8	0
Shadow Conspiracy (1997)	"but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of that sort. Stars Charlie Sheen. There's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to drop the microcassette in the Potomac River by accident. If they'd cast Emilio Estevez in the part that never would've happened. chance. Wow, it's that bad. The film could have used a more likable hero than Bobby Bishop, blandly played by Charlie Sheen, who whispers his lines incomprehensibly. The pairing of Linda Hamilton with Sheen doesn't add anything to the movie. Donald Sutherland must have a lot to explain to his friends in how he accepted to appear in this picture. no annoying minute in it. The camera movements are superb. The music score very functional. The acting of the protagonists can't be better. I don't understand why so much comments are negative. Perhaps those people don't like to give positive comments ? Anyway. I only want to give my comment and that's what counts for me. Every review is subjective. Waterston didn't exactly inspire confidence as the President. Linda Hamilton was good as Amanda. This wasn't a great action thriller, but it was good nevertheless. Too violent for my taste (and there was a stern warning on the TV station I watched, even after the movie was cleaned up for TV), but I enjoyed the chases and the occasional comedy. on lazy plotting to move it's action along. The conspiracy is easily uncovered and the killer is easily avoided.  When even Charlie Sheen describes this as ""a piece of s***"" then you know it's not going to be good.  Avoid this - an alternative is Enemy of the State which has similar themes but is much, much better. "	4.9	0
