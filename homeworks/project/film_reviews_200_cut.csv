Finding Nemo	I have enjoyed most of the computeranimated film made so far ranging from Pixar film like Toy Story and The Incredibles to DreamWorks film like Shrek But Finding Nemo is the one that remains unparalleled not because of it comedy or creativity both of which are equaled in the Toy Story movie and in Monsters Inc but because it truly more than any of the previous computeranimated feature reinvents the genre of the childrens animated filmHumor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration There are occasional nod to this brand of humor in Finding NemoIll	8.1	1
The Incredibles	Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired Shark Tale Pixar contains it remarkably success story with The Incredibles And while I have to say that I liked Finding Nemo a bit better The Incredibles is still an amazing movieFirst of all this is because it funny Its not so funny that youre constantly laughing out loud but there are more than enough good joke in the movie to keep you entertained and it full of good observation about superhero movie note all the ridiculous superhero and villain name and reference to other movie Its also a brilliant James BondWOW	8.0	1
Iron Man 3	Yes you heard me Iron Man 3 is an improvement over lackluster Iron Man 2 I am glad Shane Black replaced the director Jon Favreau who ruined the sequel and didnt know what to do with the movie I love this movie and it is one of my favorite MCU film I love it more than the last Iron Man movie The third entry of Iron Man is a decent kickass badass action film There is a ton of action in there The character are better development Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Doctor Strange Black Panther ThorIron	7.2	0
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest	This movie ha everything a good blockbuster should have star cast special effect a healthy dose of drama romance a villain so to say sadly also a rather weak story with an ending just calling for part three just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy I didnt get that feeling that the adventure is finished somehow more like a soap opera ending On the other hand some dialog are really funny and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirate All and all go and see this sit down in that cinema and have a goodWell	7.3	0
Spirited Away	Personally Ive never seen anything a original in an animated film a in this deeply mythical fairytale What a surreal idea for a movie Its hard to find an adequate description because I also dont want to spoil this in the slightest way but this film ha a sense of otherness to it for lack of a better word like none Ive ever seen And the strange mythical nature of this film apart from the amazing artwork is probably one of the main reason for it appeal to me Maybe the theme of the story dontSpirited Away is the first	8.6	1
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation	Having seen the previous four Mission Impossible film I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped I guess my expectation for action thriller centering on secret agent were set too high because I saw the Bourne trilogy and Daniel Craigs James Bond film first The first three MI film all seemed a little too slow cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing The fourth one wa pretty good even if the story doe feel a little forgettableSo where doe that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise My expectationsAll	7.4	0

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald	Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan I loved all 8 HP movie and really liked the 1st installment of Newts adventure a well This movie just didnt really do the trick for me There wa absolutely nothing to complain about visually the movie wa even more stunning than the first one with even more beautifully designed Beasts And a many other people have mentioned a a Harry Potter fan you just cant hate this movie Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of reference to theAs	7.0	0
The Predator	Like everybody else back in 1987 I wa really impressed by Predator It wa pretty simple and straightforward movie but it introduced a pretty neat and unique concept and well there wa something special about the atmosphere the jungle it just came alive and took him It wa awesome Unfortunately sequel suffered from some seriously poor writing while Aliens versus Predator franchise turned out to be a complete disaster Everybody know that and everybody wanted Predator franchise to return to it former glory one day Thats why I had some hope for this one I seriously did Thats why IInstead	5.7	0

Replicas	Yes youll undoubtedly spot some of Keanus more pivotal SciFi role converging into this character Namely Johnny Mnemonic Neo Kevin Lomax and a always his Tedencies But the character is not the draw in Replicas This Movie is purely playing out realworld hypothetical set it up with a grieving fatherhusband who scientific research is already on the verge of breakthrough on multiple level The plot touch on a few nearfuture concept that havent exactly been approached in this manor or at least all in one story line Without giving too much of it away I will say that there areIll	6.1	0
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom	There is no way so many people would be AMAZED at this POS movie and even compare it to Spielbergs original JP masterpiece or call it one on it own right This movie isnt even worth to be an episode in an average cable tv show Its the blandest most predictable and lazy part of the series so far There is not even the slightest hint of originality or anything fresh in the whole film Nor is there any tempo to the story And barring quite good Goldblums speech the whole 100 of dialogue are forgettable a are all ofThis	6.3	0

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1	Up until now I wa convinced that from the 4th book onwards Harry Potterbooks had become too complex to make into film Goblet of Fire wa a sore disappointment Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more even if it wasnt a bad film per se personally I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I felt they left out too much Halfblood Prince while visually stunning did not capture the brilliance of the book With Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I think the maker have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that wa both fun to watch for casualA	7.7	0

Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms	To preface I rarely trust review that have 1010 just because usually people who do them are biased towards genre theme actor etc in the way that they are fan of those and it automatically bump up the score of a film for them to a few point above what it really deserves It might be the case for me here too although I must say that I am not a huge fun of anime in general I like certain title a lot but Im not really following the genre So yesterday I felt like watching anime on a bigMariI	7.4	0

First Man	I saw this movie at a sneak preview and I had high expectation given the hype but sadly this wa no The Right Stuff The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based Neil Armstrong He is portrayed a a colorless technocrat who is somewhat cold to his family The movie focus mainly on his family relationship and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary therefore the movie lack a lot of drama This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life a a fighter pilot test pilot and astronaut The movie coversI	7.7	0

BlacKkKlansman	Theres much good about this movie starting with Ron Stallworths incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan Racism in all it ugliness is powerfully shown Theres a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people Unfortunately there a lot wrong with the movie too Most of this is because the director embellished the true story Im not a big fan of director tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch and then still claim based on a true story The result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie particularly in theSpike Lee	7.6	0
